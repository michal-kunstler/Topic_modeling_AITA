AITA for bringing my SIL’s wallet to the restaurant when she conveniently always forgets it?,"Edit: update on profile

My (f28) SIL “Amy” (f26) always comes to visit from out of town. She stays with us instead of a hotel, and always wants to go to expensive restaurants. She always conveniently forgets her wallet, or domes up with some excuses as to why she can’t pay her share. She has implied that since I make much more money than her, I should be the one to pay (no, not my husband should pay, but me *specifically*). I do make a fair amount of money, but not so much that I can treat someone every time they come into town. Nonetheless, in the past, I have just paid the bill and asked her to pay me back. She never has. 

She had made a reservation at an extremely expensive restaurant last night, and before we left, I made it clear that I wouldn’t be paying her bill. 

This is where I might be the asshole, and I’ll admit I got this move straight from and episode of Two and a Half men. As we were leaving, her and my husband went to the car. I pretended I forgot something and went back inside. I found her wallet sitting right on top of her suitcase. I put it in my purse and we went to the restaurant.

When we were done eating, I asked for separate bills. She said no, we need one bill, because she “forgot” her wallet again. I reached in my purse and said, “this wallet?” 

She was extremely furious. She said that I should not have touched or grabbed her wallet. 

So AITA for taking her wallet and bringing it to the restaurant?

Edit: Wow, thanks for all the awards!!! Jeez lol! So many comments that I can’t keep up, but thank you to everyone who had something to say.

"AITA for bringing up my brother's ""premature"" birth at Christmas dinner to get my parents to shut up?","I am a nurse practitioner and I am the primary care provider for a lot of the low risk maternity cases at the practice where I work.  I also work hand in hand with the doctors and midwives to create a healthy maternity, birth, and postpartum situation. 

My fiancee is completing her residency.  We live together and have for a few years now.  We aren't in any hurry to get married.  We originally had plans to do so a couple of years ago but then we got really busy for two years.  

It is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin.  I don't really care.  I'm an adult and I do what I want.  We are getting married in June.  

So we are visiting my parents for Christmas. The way it came together this year everyone is at my parents house.  So that's my folks, my three siblings, myself and fiancee, and seven grandchildren.  So seventeen people.  

At dinner my mom starts going on about how she is so glad that we are finally getting married and she won't be embarrassed at church any more.  And my dad says how proud he is of his three older kids who all either waited to get married before moving in together or got married right away after moving in together.  My fiancee was getting embarrassed and I was getting mad over this stupid argument we have had too many times. And a family dinner was the last straw.  

I have asked them repeatedly to just accept that they cannot control how I live my life.  I refuse to stay with them when I visit even if I come alone.  Hotels are just easier.  

So I started talking about a premature baby I had been reading about.  It was almost three months premature and weighed about 1.6 pounds. It was super strong and healthy for being born so little and the NICU had high hopes for the baby doing well.  

My mom and dad both got deer in the headlights looks on their faces.  To bad. Should not have fucked around with my fiancee's feelings.  

So I asked about my oldest brother.  He was born almost four months premature.  Is there a chance that we could check out the family album where we keep all the records of family births and stuff.  

I already know my brother was over 9 pounds and almost 23"" long when he was born.  My grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me. 

The subject gets changed very fast.  After supper my parents told me that I should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern.  I told them that if I heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life I would make sure to keep bringing up the FACT that my mom was in her second trimester when they got married.

My parents are mad at me for telling them how to behave in their own home.  But my fiancee is happy that they seem to be off the subject for good.  

AITA?",56113,zvmflw,You can tell the family about the time you were embarrassed at the Univ.  Where you told everyone in your class that it was normal for someone to be 9lbs at 6 months.

AITA for not taking down my video that was a gift from my best man.,"I have a sister that’s 6 years older than me. 

My parents for years cancel on me last min because of my sister. I have a basketball game. Ops sorry sister doesn’t feel like going out. I am graduating ops sorry sister had a bad day at work. They have missed both major and smaller events in my life because of her melt downs.

I met the love of my life. We decided to tie the knot. From the beginning I told my parents how I am worried my sister will ruin another special moment in my life. My mom told me over and over again it would not happen.

The day of my wedding. I received a voicemail from my mom saying they couldn’t come because my sisters dog was sick and she was upset.

I was hurt, my best man however is a jokester. He took my phone then went to my fiancé and asked if he could post a video of our wedding as a gift? On social media. She loved his idea.

I had no idea about it until I came home. Our honeymoon was at a lake side cabin. No cell service.

The post caption was “My best friend. He is an amazing person even if his parents NEVER showed up for him.  video was still pictures of us next to her parents, me on the dance floor, cutting the cake. Where you would normally see both parents in wedding pictures. The sound behind the video was my moms voice mail explaining how they couldn’t come because my sisters dog was sick.

I came home a week later to hundreds of messages.
Family members from both sides insisting I take it down. I was told my sister hasn’t stopped crying. My mom is refusing to leave the house. 

I maybe the A here. I didn’t take it down when I got my messages. I didn’t call my family back right away. I waited until my vacation time was over at work and enjoyed my time with my Wife. In our new home. Before I contacted anyone.

My dad told me to take down the video. It was “just a bad night for them”. That they will make it up to me and my wife for not coming. My reply was exactly how do you plan to “make up” my wedding? It’s a once in a life time thing. You choose to ignore my feeling on the whole matter.

Then he just repeated he will make it up to me. I told him I would take down the video only when he made up missing my wedding. Flustered we both hung up the phone before we both said things we shouldn’t have.

Am I the A here. I could have just taken down the video.",54700,wyjbjs,"NTA

My parents missed my wedding too all because my sister didn’t want to come because my husband is from Italy & we had it in his hometown & she didn’t like the weather forecast.Lol.No joke. 
Even despite their tickets & accommodation being paid for.
(Story of my life. Missed events due to her issues/needs & I can’t/don’t even blame my sister because she’s so enabled by my parents enabling & doesn’t know better lol)

Didn’t know until the night before needing to pick them up at airport.

I cried and then laughed and then got married without them. 

Never spoke to anyone ever again and been NC for almost 15 years.

You get to a point where you realize that what you allow will continue. 

Don’t ever take that video down.

Let them be reminded every year it comes up that they are to blame and their mistakes are the reason you cut them off.",1563,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wyjbjs/aita_for_not_taking_down_my_video_that_was_a_gift/,"['sister', 'thats', 'years', 'older', 'parents', 'years', 'cancel', 'last', 'min', 'because', 'sister', 'basketball', 'game', 'ops', 'sorry', 'sister', 'feel', 'like', 'going', 'graduating', 'ops', 'sorry', 'sister', 'bad', 'day', 'work', 'missed', 'major', 'smaller', 'events', 'life', 'because', 'melt', 'downs', 'met', 'love', 'life', 'decided', 'tie', 'knot', 'beginning', 'told', 'parents', 'worried', 'sister', 'ruin', 'another', 'special', 'moment', 'life', 'mom', 'told', 'would', 'happen', 'day', 'wedding', 'received', 'voicemail', 'mom', 'saying', 'come', 'because', 'sisters', 'dog', 'was', 'sick', 'was', 'upset', 'was', 'hurt', 'best', 'man', 'however', 'jokester', 'took', 'phone', 'went', 'fiancé', 'asked', 'could', 'post', 'video', 'wedding', 'gift', 'social', 'media', 'loved', 'his', 'idea', 'idea', 'came', 'home', 'honeymoon', 'was', 'lake', 'side', 'cabin', 'cell', 'service', 'post', 'caption', 'was', 'best', 'friend', 'amazing', 'person', 'even', 'his', 'parents', 'never', 'showed', 'video', 'was', 'still', 'pictures', 'us', 'next', 'parents', 'dance', 'floor', 'cutting', 'cake', 'would', 'normally', 'see', 'parents', 'wedding', 'pictures', 'sound', 'behind', 'video', 'was', 'moms', 'voice', 'mail', 'explaining', 'come', 'because', 'sisters', 'dog', 'was', 'sick', 'came', 'home', 'week', 'later', 'hundreds', 'messages', 'family', 'members', 'sides', 'insisting', 'take', 'was', 'told', 'sister', 'stopped', 'crying', 'mom', 'refusing', 'leave', 'house', 'maybe', 'take', 'got', 'messages', 'call', 'family', 'back', 'right', 'away', 'waited', 'vacation', 'time', 'was', 'work', 'enjoyed', 'time', 'wife', 'new', 'home', 'before', 'contacted', 'anyone', 'dad', 'told', 'take', 'video', 'was', 'bad', 'night', 'make', 'wife', 'coming', 'reply', 'was', 'exactly', 'plan', 'make', 'wedding', 'its', 'once', 'life', 'time', 'thing', 'choose', 'ignore', 'feeling', 'whole', 'matter', 'repeated', 'make', 'told', 'would', 'take', 'video', 'only', 'made', 'missing', 'wedding', 'flustered', 'hung', 'phone', 'before', 'said', 'things', 'could', 'taken', 'video']",sister thats years older parents years cancel last min because sister basketball game ops sorry sister feel like going graduating ops sorry sister bad day work missed major smaller events life because melt downs met love life decided tie knot beginning told parents worried sister ruin another special moment life mom told would happen day wedding received voicemail mom saying come because sisters dog was sick was upset was hurt best man however jokester took phone went fiancé asked could post video wedding gift social media loved his idea idea came home honeymoon was lake side cabin cell service post caption was best friend amazing person even his parents never showed video was still pictures us next parents dance floor cutting cake would normally see parents wedding pictures sound behind video was moms voice mail explaining come because sisters dog was sick came home week later hundreds messages family members sides insisting take was told sister stopped crying mom refusing leave house maybe take got messages call family back right away waited vacation time was work enjoyed time wife new home before contacted anyone dad told take video was bad night make wife coming reply was exactly plan make wedding its once life time thing choose ignore feeling whole matter repeated make told would take video only made missing wedding flustered hung phone before said things could taken video 
UPDATE AITA for walking out of the Airport when I saw my husband's mom standing there with her luggage?,"Hello!.


I don't know where to begin...it's been an absolute nightmare recently. And I feel like I was losing my sanity.

So for more details about my situation. I have to admit that my husband's mom favors him over all his siblings. this affected his relationship with them and me as well. He's never seen an issue with how differently his mom treats him, it bothered me and made me feel uncomfortable. The whole dynamic made me feel uncomfortable. Going Low contact has never even been an option. Like he has to see her or call her everyday.

Most of his siblings don't talk to him and I 100% believe it's because of his mom's favoritism like I said. He does bare some blame for not seeing how wrong this is til this day.

In many instances I found myself making excuses for his behavior. Even in my post. I did it spontaniously and I don't know why. But I guess it's because of how much I love him and because I really really wanted to be able to work things this type of things out without letting them affect our marriage.


regarding what happened with the trip, He tried to have a talk with me and most of what he said came from place of blame,  Blame towards me. I just couldn't continue with this argument. I told him I needed space and that I would be going to stay with my sister for a while. He didn't take it well, he literally got up from the couch and opened the door telling me to go right then. In that moment and seeing how he was still not even anywhere near understanding what he has done just....made things perfectly clear to me. I just had pictured years and years of my life being lived like that and I was like no...I can't do it, Can't take anymore of it especially when he keeps focusing on being right every time. His mom can do no wrong. I'm always the aggressive, crazy, jealous, pathetic, overreactor.

All these people's opinions, advice and concerns were like a spark...like the wake up call I really needed. Though I wish that it didn't get this far but what's done is done.


Right now I'm staying with my sister (I brought my dog with me as well) He sent me his last message telling I'm the one choosing to end what we had together but I believe it's the other way around, especially with how he keeps making his mom the victim in this situation. It's become clear now that we keep going in circles with no end in reach and I'm just so exhausted and overwhelmed. I'm not mad at him and don't expect him to change but...at least I'm given options to decide what's best for me and my future even if it's seperation and divorce.

A big thank you to those who reached out with resources that I feel very very lucky to have come across. Just wanted to give you an update since many of you asked for it.",51466,ur2l3s,"I'm sorry you are going through this, but I'm also so very, very, very proud of you. You are standing up for yourself.

AITA for walking out of the Airport when I saw my husband's mom standing there with her luggage?,"

I F30 don't have the best relationship with my husband's mom. Since day one she tried to make remarks and compare me to her ??. She then tried to get on my good side and started overly praising everything I do and sometimes even copying me like that one time when she LITERALLY dyied her hair purple just like mine and when everyone pointed out how ridiculous she looked, she actually blamed me and accused me of trying to make a joke out of her.



So, Anyways! My husband and I took 2 weeks off work to go visit some places out of the country - tourism in other words. Thing is I was the one who saved up for and arranged for the trip (my husband was responsible for booking the tickets). My husband's mom wanted to come along and threw temper tantrums when I said no. She called, texted, sent people to talk to me into letting her come, even threatened to call the police and make some complaint up to get us to stay if she can't come. My husband said we should just take her but I told him he was wrong to tell her about the trip in the first place. He gave me an ultimatim. said he wouldn't go if she can't come and I told him I'd gladly call his bluff which made him take his words back and say ""FINE! I will tell her to stop it because we won't take her"".

Things got quieter, suspeciously quieter. the day of the trip came and we got to the airport at 2pm. My husband was walking ahead of me and was looking left and right like he was looking for someone. I asked him but he didn't respond. He lead me to the waiting area and first thing I saw was his mom standing there with her luggage . I froze in my spot, I felt a cold wave washing over me and I was fuming inside. She and my husband were hugging that's when I quietly turned around and started walking towards the exit. My husband followed me while shouting at me to stop. he tried to stop me but I told him off the harshest way possible. He tried to say I was overreacting and that his mom was there ""anyway"" and I should let it go and not mess the trip up for us. I told him he and his mom could still go and that I was going home.

I went home and sobbed into my dog's fur for several minutes. turned out he booked her a ticket without me knowing. an hour later he came home yelling and raging about how pathetic and spiteful I was to walk out and go home and ruin the trip last minute. I told him he caused this to happen. he said that I was being so hard on his mom it's ridiculous. I refused to fight any more but he kept on berating me then called my family to tell them that the trip was cancelled and that it was because of me. My family said that I shouldn't have ruined it for myself and should've sucked it up and done my best to enjoy.

"AITA for dropping our dinner on the ground and walking out when my boyfriend asked me ""What's for dinner tonight, b*tch?""","I was over my boyfriend's apartment this weekend and I was cooking dinner because he was studying for exams. I made pasta and a chunky sauce with meatballs and veggies. I told him dinner was ready and he goes ""what's for dinner tonight, B*TCH"" ... With like a lot of emphasis on the last word. 

I was fed up, I'd had a pretty rough day with work and I have some awfully bad associations with that word being used by other people in my life who were pretty abusive. So I was so irritated that I dropped the pot of pasta sauce I'd been carrying right on the ground and was like ""Well nothing's for dinner tonight now. And I better not hear you using that word again, it's for the girls""

He was freaking out about how sauce had landed on his rug and he even said ""you're seriously acting like a bitch right now, I dunno what else to call it""

I just walked out and got takeout for myself and went to my friends house. She thought it was funny but my boyfriend was furious, he kept texting and calling and sending me voice memos trying to explain that saying ""what's for dinner tonight b*tch"" was a TikTok trend.... And that he was just quoting something as a joke to put on tiktok. 

I thought that was the shittiest excuse ever, it doesn't matter if he saw it as a joke, or stole the ""joke"", it was still disrespectful. 

But it didn't change the fact he thought that shit was funny, to demean me when I was trying to do him a favor. Like hell I came over when he was studying to make a home cooked dinner and he decides it's time for jokes? So I put my phone on don't disturb for the night and split a bottle of wine with my friend and her roommate. 

The next morning he was sending me angry texts demanding I clean his rug because he was too busy with exams to do it. I was shocked he left it overnight, that's disgusting. I texted him back saying.

""Yeah so that's the b*tch tax honey :) leave me alone till you're ready to handle your own cooking and cleaning because this b*tch isn't anymore. Also it's vile you left that soaking in all night""

He called me and told me that he was okay with doing his own household work, but I did throw a full pot of sauce at the ground so that's on me to clean up. 

I told him ""yeah no I'm not comfortable doing chores for you if you see me like your b*tch"" 

He told me he didn't and it was just a ""trend"" and I got pissed off he was playing that ""TikTok trend"" BS excuse again and I told him ""Well I'm starting a trend called 'saucing' where as a little joke people throw pasta sauce around! You can't be mad because it's just a little trend, a little jokey joke, just a little prank bro!"" 

He got really pissed off and hung up on me and now I'm seriously wondering if this dumb fucking tiktok joke is gonna be the end of things between us

AITA for how I reacted when my boyfriend asked me ""what's for dinner tonight, b*tch""

Edit to address a comment I've gotten a lot and I don't have time to reply to every time:

> ""But did you tell him not to call you a bitch? Like how would he know otherwise?""

Honestly if someone has gotten to the age of 30 and not realized that women (as a whole) do not like having demeaning slurs used against them... They're beyond my help. 

This isn't something that needs to be told. I shouldn't have to go through life like ""Hey man just in case you were thinking I might like demeaning slurs against my gender used on me, I don't actually :)""

And if you were about to comment something like that, let me just tell you in no uncertain terms... WOMEN DO NOT LIKE BEING CALLED BITCHES BY MEN. DO NOT CALL WOMEN BITCHES.

AITA for storming off from my sister's wedding after she deadnamed my son?,"I'm a 45yro single father of three. Theur mom died 10 years ago. I have 3 sons, 17yro Andrew, 15yro Connor and 14yro Max. Connor was born female, he is trans. He came out as trans 5 years ago, and has now socially transitioned, not yet phisically.

My sister (38F) just got married. Me and my sons were also invited. My family has known that Connor is trans for 2 years now, some have adjusted well, some not so much. My sister is pretty indifferent about it. 

Her wedding was really super well organised to the last detail. She wanted all the men to wear shirt+tie and then women sundresses. I textednher a picture of our outfits the day before the wedding, and she said ""where's Nia's dress?"". I was a bit surprised and told her not to deadname my son and that he'll be wearing a shirt and tie like the rest of men there or we aren't coming. She said ""fine"" and that was it.

At the reception, my sister got mad that Connor was wearing a tie, but didn't say much after that. When we sat down at our table, the card ""Nia"". I went to my sister and she said she used ""their real name"". I told her me and the boys are leaving and she told me ""don't you dare cause a scene at MY WEDDING, Nia can be a guy any other day"".

"AITA for getting up from my chair in the middle of christmas dinner and shouting ""SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODYYYYY"" in response to my husband's observation?","So, Ever since I had my son months ago, my husband has started making indirect comments about my body. He never says any hurtful words but I find his ""observations"" as he calls it hurtful. For example, he'd see me wearing an old top and say ""oh that top used to look good on you but not anymore though..."" or when he looks at my waist and says ""Wow, didn't know your waist could get this wide!"". Basically passive stuff that I tried to ignore til it extended to friends and family. FYI this went on for months and months and months!!.



We went to christmas celebration at his family's home. My SIL complimented my floral maxi dress and my husband said ""I agree it looks nice on you...though I have to admit that your waist could get smaller than this!"". Awkward silence took over. I was absolutely fuming and this was my last straw. So I got up from my chair in the middle of dinner and shouted at the top of my lungs ""SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODDDYYY!!!!"". He was absolutely speechless as his family stared while some others tried to get me to calm down but situation got more tense and dinner ended up being cut short and my husband storming off to his friend's place to spend the night upon leaving a very nasty text saying I embarrassed him and made a scene over an ""observation"" he made. He called me childish and told me to get therapy for my insecurities instead of verbally abusing him and scaring his family.

AITA for silently getting up and walking out of the restaurant during NYE dinner after I was told to pay for everyone at the table (my inlaws)?,"
I f32 recently inherited a good amount of money from my mom. I keep the money in a seperate account as I still haven't decided what to do with it and I didn't want it to go to waste.


I noticed my husband constantly bringing up the inheritance money and making countless suggestions as to how I should spend it. Another thing is that he expects me pay for nearly everything the past couple of weeks.


For NYE, My husband and I met up with his family at a restaurant to celebrate. It was going fine until I found out that I was expected to pay for everyone at the table. My husband's mom joked about paying for dinner out of my "" inheritance pocket"" which made me livid but I showed no reaction. Just silently paid for my own food/drinks. Then got up and made my way out of the restaurant. They were shouting after me like a crowd and my husband tried to get me to come back but I drove home.


He got back at 3 a.m yeling at me saying I was pathetic to get up and walk out on him and his family after they *relied* on me to pay for their food and thougt I was gracious enough to do it BUT they were wrong. He said I humiliated him and family and that what I did was an attempt to get back at them for not being able to help mom when she was sick. Not true is all I'm gonna say.


He is mad and is saying that I caused a huge rift between his family and me when it wouldn't have hurt me to pay for the celebratory dinner.

"AITA for how I fought my boyfriend's medical bill, going ""too far""?","My boyfriend had to go to the ER after a accident, and he got a truly ridiculous bill back. I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure. 

I went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad. 

So I...

- had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records. 

- got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices

- called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute

- bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere 

- google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management 

- got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors

- every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my ""client"" at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue. 

- escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company. 

Well, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars. 

Well, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle. 

But then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone. 

He started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of.

He told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill. 

I was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass? 

I was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks.

Hospital billing is intentionally screwed up and difficult to address issues.

I pretty much had to schedule hours into my weekly schedule to deal with contesting collections, getting it sent back to billing, dealing with some other person in billing, and etc. With a newborn through 1yo, and while I was also working full-time. It was an additional part time job to ""fix the damn hospital bill.""

AITA for using flash cards to explain to my brother and his wife why they can't bring their rainbow baby to my wedding?,"
My fiancee (F) and I (M) are getting married. We've decided wedding's gonna be childfree. No hate towards children just to keep it more organized and contained.


My brother 'Chris' (M) and his wife (F) have a 3 yro son who everyone calls ""miracle"" or ""rainbow"" baby. He came after several failed pregnancies that lasted for years. 

When they found out that my nephew was included in the no children rule; they tried to convince me to make an exception for him. Chris told me his son is a miracle baby and his presence at the wedding will bring ""blessings"" for me and my fiancee. I refused and said no, the wedding is childfree. His wife kept sending my fiancee pics of my nephew when he was months old (what that mean??). I told them no, and to stop.


My brother told me this might cause a rift in our relationship, I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. He asked again and pointed out how his baby is different since he's a rainbow, a miracle baby. I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. They brought it up when they visited at my home and I knew they weren't going to stop so I'd made flash cards in advance with the phrase ""the wedding is childfree, period"" and pulled them out and started slowly showing them the flash cards one by one in this order: 

- The wedding (with a sticker of bride and groom). 

- Is Child (with a sticker of a baby). 

- FREEE (with a sticker of a 🚫 sign). 

- PERIOD (with a huge, black dot sticker). 

They both were stunned. I asked if they get it now and Chris had lost his shit. His wife had already grabbed her stuff and walked out. Chris called me an asshole for doing this and said that I disrespected him, his wife and their son who's my one and only nephew. He rushed out after we argued. My fiancee saw the whole thing and thought that it was funny but my parents and Chris are livid beyond measure.

AITA for refusing to tell my husband the gender of our baby after he skipped going to the dr appointment with me?,"My husband & I are expecting. This is our first baby and we're excited. Thing is he barely attends any dr appointments with me and his excuses aren't even valid. He's willing to miss the dr appointment over soccer or a drink or board game with friends. His response is always ""I'm not the one carrying the baby, why do I have to go see the dr with you?"".


Last week was my final straw. He was supposed to come with me for the baby's gender reveal appointment but he chose to not come last minute because his friend invited him to fish 'n' chips meal. I was pretty livid but didn't make a fuss about it. Mom went with me instead.



He texted asking me to tell him the results (boy or girl) but I refused to tell him. He kept spam calling me but I hung up each time. He came home fuming demanding I tell him the results but I refused and bluntly told him, since he refused to attend the appointment then he gets no results til after the baby's born and said I was wiling to die on this hill. He went off calling me spiteful and immature for doing this and punishing him. He said he's the father and has the right to know. He then called me dramatic since I wasn't alone and mom was with me. I said he gets no results period.


He's been fuming about it and told his family and they're now pressuring me to stop playing mind games with him and tell him but I declined.




AITA?


EDIT/UPDATE: Hi, so, first of all, wow!!! I did not expect this to blow up. Sorry, can't answer any comments because of feeling overwhelmed...um I just wanted to mention that my husband just attempted to contact my dr to get the results. It didn't go well and we had another argument over it. He couldn't get it since his mom was the one who made the call.",42054,101hya0,"""I'm not the one carrying that baby why should I be there?"" and then suddenly ""I'm the father I have the right to know!"" Oh NOW you want to be a daddy huh?

I would laugh if this didn't infuriate me as a father/husband who was present for every single appointment my wife went to for all three of our children.

If he wants to be present at the birth tell him ""You're not the one delivering the baby, why should you have to be there?""

What a tool.

AITA for cancelling mother's day celebration that I arranged for my wife after hearing what she told my son?,"

I (M/37) have a 13 y.o son. I was a widower when I met my now wife. She has a 16 y.o daughter from another relationship. The family is often on pretty good terms. My son is the quiet one in the house, he keeps to himself a lot but not to the point of being concerning. My wife and stepdaughter are the complete opposit. They both encourage him to be outgoing and share activities and join gatherings with extended family. My son complained about having to be forced out of his comfort zone and having his need for space invalidated. I spoke to both my wife and stepdaughter and asked them to give him space and freedom to spend his time however he wanted. they apologized and promised to let him be.

As mother's day was approaching I wanted to throw my wife a surprise mother's day celebration. It was no longer a surprise because my stepdaughter gave her the heads so she could prepare. Yesterday I got off work earlier than usual to get final arrangements done (we planned to celebrate at the restaurant and invited her family there) I had the key and while I was entering the house through the front door I overheard my wife and stepdaughter talking to my son. My wife was asking my son if he could convince me to let him stay home and not go with them to the restaurant to celebrate. I paused and decided to keep listening. My son said why and she told him that his introverted and socially inept ""attitude"" will make her family uncomfortable and will ruin the mood. He promised her that he'd be well behaved and would try to interact and socialize with everyone but she said that she wasn't buying it. He kept reassuring her but she snapped and told him that technically, she's not his mom so she didn't get why he wanted to celebrate mother's day with her so badly. My stepdaughter threw some (I don't remember) backhanded comment and then both of them were shocked to see me standing there. Both were staring without saying anything. I told my son and his stepsister to go to their rooms then told my wife that the celebration was off, cancelled. she tried to argue asking why repeatedly and I told her why. She tried to explain that she didn't mean it like that and that I only heard part of the conversation but not all of it. I told her I was done arguing and the decision was already made. She yelled asking what she was going to tell her family and said that I was making tremendous mistake towards her.

I ignored her while she kept throwing tantrum after a tantrum. Early this morning she took my stepdaughter and went to stay with her folks. not a single call or text from her so far. Situation is full of tension. I'm upset still but more hurt to be honest. I mean yes I did say I was going to havw this celebration but I thought that what she said to my son was too harsh to ignore.",41992,ulcrp6,NTA. But have you talked with your son?

AITA for kicking out one of my bridesmaids for showing up in the wrong dress?,"My (23F) wedding was back on Saturday December 31st and I'm still getting backlash from this, so I want to know if this was an AH move.

In the country I live in it's currently winter, and we get a fair amount of snow so my wedding was a winter themed wedding. The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOH""s dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories. 

I have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice.

She said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more ""girly"". I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOH""s dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black. 

I paid for all the dresses. 

Fast forward to wedding day, everyone's getting their hair and makeup done and Kat show's up 30 minutes late holding a bag that looked like it had a dress inside. I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool.

So fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation. 

I confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend. 

The wedding went on and it was truly amazing.

Ever since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that.

AITA for throwing them out of a house that we own. Son and future In-Laws decide to exclude his family from wedding. They thought son owned the house not us.,"My wife and I bought a four bedroom house in PA that my son lives in.  Our son went to College in PA and wanted to stay in the area.  So we bought the house as a second home, we live in NJ and commute into Manhattan for work.  We figured that he would have a place to live and we could visit every so often and spend some quality time together. 

We pay the taxes and services / maintenance on the house, our son pays for his groceries and the house utilities. All was going well for a few years, our son meets a girl and they get serious. We met her and she seems nice enough.  The announce their engagement and she moves into the house with our son.  

Now for the problem: The wedding !!! 

We hold a little get to know you BBQ at the PA house, my son and daughter are there, as are our sons fiancé and her parents, and sisters.   We all seem to be getting along well, my wife, daughter and the fiancé go into the house along with her mother an sisters and my son.  A few minutes later my wife and daughter come out and are really upset. The come over and tell me we're leaving and driving back to NJ.  I try to find out what happened.  Once we get back to NJ and they calmed down they tell me that our son and his fiancé along with her family don't want us at the wedding.  According to what I was told ""We're not their kind of people"".  I was livid, I called my son and asked him WTH this was about.  He tells me that her family feel that we are not good enough and will embarrass them at a family wedding and that we are all uninvited from the wedding.  

I let a week go by to calm myself down and drive back to the PA house, the new future in-laws are in the house along with the fiancé.  It appears that they all moved into the house They ask me why I'm there, I tell them that since we aren't invited to the wedding, I was coming over to talk to my son.  They tell me to leave their house.  I lost it, and told them that they had 30 days to get out.  Tell my son I'm selling the house and he could find somewhere else to live with all of you.  I go to a realtor in town and list the house for sale. 

They call my son at work and tell him what I said.  Apparently they thought that he owned the house. He calls me and asks why I'm selling his house, I tell him I paid for it along with the taxes on it and it is mine.  He was living there rent free, but since he doesn't want us in his new life, he has to get out.  I tell him the same as I told his future in-laws they have 30 days to get out then I'll get a lawyer and get them evicted. 

Am I the AH for taking a hard stance on this.  He is my son but thein-laws seem to take over and we no longer count.",41274,vnl1hw,NTA. But your son must not be very smart.

AITA for getting my daughter a hotel room entirely for herself after her stepsisters made her sleep on the floor?,"My dad passed away 2 weeks ago. Me, my wife 'Candace' and my daughter (16) 'Shiloh' and her stepsisters (19) & (17) flew to my hometown to attend the funeral. After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls).


While I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said ""It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way.."". I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm ""playing favorites"" and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself.

We went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me.


ETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed.

Also. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.



ETA#2 For those that are calling me an ah for giving my daughter her name. Her mom did that and she's deceased so please let's not focus on that.

And also, I've known my stepdaughters since they were little.

AITA for getting mad my artist hid their initials in my tattoo?,"This is a short one. Names changed for privacy. 

I went to a tattoo shop in my area, with a photo of the tattoo I wanted. It was one my dad had gotten to honor my passed grandfather who’s father also had it. But the point is - it was important to me that the tattoo looked EXACTLY as it did in the photo. 

I get to the shop, I explain everything, I pay, get the tattoo, and we’re done, I think it looks awesome, everything is great! Until a few weeks later when I show my great grandmother the tattoo. She’s static, grabs my arm to look at and compliment it, then asks, “Who’s AJ?” 

I ask her what she means, and she points out on the tattoo where the initials A and J or maybe T were hidden into the tattoo. I’m instantly pissed, as my artists name is Alice Trever. She tries to assure me it’s no big deal if I hadn’t noticed it til now, but I still reached out to the artist sort of irritated. They told me the style of art I got is called traditional and it’s “pretty trad” for all artists who do that style to do it. I demanded a partial refund and they refused, so I complained to the owner who made the artist give me a full refund. 

Now the artist is running a full smear campaign, talking about moving shops, and all kinds of crap.

AITA for speaking Italian to my GF's rude Italian American family and embarrassing them?,"**ETA**: There may have been some confusion as to my gf's reaction, she was ashamed her family dug so deep into me, not about my response. After wanting to die for the next 48 hours she agreed I did the right thing and that it was funny

Backstory: due to my dad's job we lived in Italy for 3 years when I was younger, so I speak Italian almost fluently (it's been awhile, so I've lost some of it)

&#x200B;

Recently I started dating a girl. She's great and I love her so much. I met her family a few nights ago for dinner. She warned me that the male side of her family is very big into being macho, into ""testing"" the boys the women date and are VERY big on taking pride in their Italian ancestry. I think besides the grandfather, however, they were almost all born in Bergen County, NJ but whatever, its nice to take pride in ones heritage.

&#x200B;

Long story short at dinner they kept making jokes at my expense (I honestly would not call it bullying, just things about my height, beard, shaved head). They tried making fun of my IT job too but stopped once I told them my income. It was overall not a bad experience, but a not so pleasant one. Anyways, her older brother kept pushing things, giving me exceptional amounts of shit for playing Lacrosse in HS (apparently its a sport for prissy rich kids and not manly like football or baseball). He ended his rant by saying ""hey, we're just a big Italian family, we're loud and tell it how we see it! Hahaha!"" and all the family except my girlfriend laughed. So I, for the next minute, responded to everything they said in Italian. My girlfriend buried her head in shame, the grandfather laughed and everyone else kept looking at each other confused before telling me they didn't speak Italian. I replied ""then don't use your Italian heritage as an excuse to behave poorly when you can't even speak the language."" They got mad, but the grandfather told them all I was right and to be quiet.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend isn't mad, just ashamed, I think the grandfather likes me, but word from my gf's sister is that all the men are furious, think I'm a smart ass and that I disrespected them and their masculinity in an unforgiveable way. So AITA?",40012,wb88y8,"NTA,

"UPDATE: AITA for ""imposing my culture"" even though I thought I was just being nice?","[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t622tm/aita_for_imposing_my_culture_even_though_i/)

First of all I just want to thank everyone for the overwhelming support and replies on my first post. I'm looking forward to going over to everyone's houses for dinner and I'll be sure to bring all the things you said you liked :-) many flower lovers out there! I'm now also apparently the DIL to a lot of hopeful parents that replied as well so I hope I can deliver on expectations!

\---

After my last update I told my bf I was sick and tired of him dancing around the issue with his parents and I was going to go over to their house whether he liked it or not. At this point I think he realized that whatever he was doing had backfired so he sat down all angry and told me he'd explain. I sat and he told me that he'd done something very spur of the moment and that he'd texted me from his dad's phone then blocked the number but begged me to listen. That he just needed to get his parents off me for a while and to not leave.

Apparently his parents had started hinting at him about marriage since my bf and I talked a lot about it. I fully expected to marry him as I said in another comment, and was honestly expecting a proposal in late spring since that's when we met. Four years dating didn't bother me but I was getting excited to settle down. However, my bf apparently realized that he absolutely didn't want to commit to anything and wanted to experiment and have fun since I ""wasn't being fun anymore"". Honestly that just made me cry since we were each other's firsts for everything and usually very good at communicating our needs.

His grand plan was to get him mad at me so I would beg for forgiveness and then he'd only accept an open relationship as an answer. Absolutely brilliant plan I know. He'd made up his parents getting mad but didn't expect me to blow off dinner completely and it's like ""hitting a jackpot"", his words not mine. He went over for dinner, hid the flowers and said we'd gotten into a huge fight but he was ""going to fix it"" but I needed space. After he confessed all this he said he was very sorry but really didn't want to miss out on new experiences when he was still young and would I consider an open relationship but pretend ours was strained with his parents so they wouldn't get suspicious?

And.....I laughed. I laughed his ass right out the door and told him absolutely not and to leave me alone while I packed because I wanted to have some new experiences too!!! He never stopped begging me to stay but I left to sleep at a friend's. After calming down for a few days I cemented the breakup and finally, actually went over to his parent's. My ex-bf's dad never even noticed the phone missing but still apologized and his mom was a mess. I did and still love them and will eat dinner there without *him* as often as I can.

"AITA for my response to my sister's boyfriend's ""brutal honesty""?","


My F35 sister F27 started dating one of those ""brutally honest"" guys few months ago. He can be quite rude and make backhanded comments about me and the family sometimes which is bothersome but my sister says he's not malicious but is just the brutally honest time and we should get used to it.


I visited my parents house to celebrate my sister's birthday and my husband couldn't come with me because he was busy, after the party we all sat down for dinner and my sister's boyfriend said it was weird that my husband and I don't have kids despite being married for 6 years now, I was shocked that he brought this up but I gave a short answer stating that it's because of infertility issues, he asked on which side and I didn't wanna answer but my sister said it's on my side. I got uncomfortable as he looked at me for a second and said that maybe not having kids now is a good thing because he thought women over 30 might ""produce"" defective babies due to age.


I told him it was none of his business but he said that he was just giving his ""honest opinion"" and that's all. I, in return, told him while maintaining eye contact: ""trust me, if I wanted an asshole's opinion, I would've farted!"". Literally everyone at the table bursted into laughter and my sister and her boyfriend were stunned. Few seconds later her boyfriend excused himself out and my sister followed then sent me a text after they left saying I was mean and disrespectful towards her boyfriend and insulted him maliciously just cause he stated his honest opinion, she also said I ruined her birthday by being petty and making her boyfriend the joke of the night infront of the family. I didn't respond but she demanded an apology via mail as soon as possible, mom agreed that I shouldn't have said what I said and should've just ignored him knowing how he is.

UPDATE: AITA for taking my niece to court over a coat?,"Here's the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za73bi/aitaa_for_taking_my_niece_to_court_over_a_coat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

So here is a quick update, since the situation has been resolved.

When my husband got home, I told him what happened and showed him the video.

He asked if I spoke with my BIL and I said no, all my conversations were with my sister. He said that he will take care of it.

Now, a disclaimer: I understand nothing when it comes to insurance claims, and this is what my husband told me/I understood happened.

My husband talked with my BIL, told him exactly what happened and showed him the *prank* video. Then he told him that the coat was insured, we will be filing a claim and submitting the video, and we might have to file charges for the claim (he assured him that we would be dropping the charges, we do not want to send niece to jail).

Then he told him that one of two things might happen: after our insurance pays us, they will come after them. If their insurance pays, their premium will skyrocket. If it doesn't, they might sue them, and might get a lien on their house. 

My BIL asked if there was a way he could pay us without involving insurance, my husband told him that that was what we wanted at first, but that my sister insisted that they will not be paying us back. 

Apparently, my BIL was not in the know, and he was very pissed off at what my niece did, and my sister's response.

So they came to this solution: my niece's car will be sold, and if it doesn't fetch the whole compensation money, she will have to get a job and pay me the whole check untill it is paid off. Also she is grounded for the rest of the school year.

I am thankful for the people who encouraged me to talk with my husband.",38273,zgv9gf,That's a fair outcome that avoids lifetime level consequences for the niece and still stings hard enough to make the point.

AITA for getting upset with my husband after he told me nothing will change while I am pregnant?,"Throwaway account. So me (26f) and my husband (28m), who I'll call ""Jake"" for this story, have been together for 5 years and married for 3. We have recently started trying for a baby as we both felt like that was the next step in our life together, and 3 weeks ago I got a positive test back.  We were really really happy and told our families, and now my mom and MIL want to throw a big baby shower for us, it was just super good news all around. 

Well 2 nights ago me and Jake were getting ready for bed when he reminds me to go through the house and make sure all the lights are off. Now he can be a little lazy at times, and it has become a nightly routine for me to make sure all the lights are off that he leaves on before we go to bed. I wasn't feeling very well and asked if he could just do it since he wasn't doing anything and was literally standing by the door. He then tells me ""No, this is what is expected of you every night."" I was a little hurt but I didn't want to fight with him so I just did it. When I came back Jake goes on this very long and unprovoked rant saying things like ""Just because you are pregnant does not mean anything will change"" and ""You are still expected to cook, clean, and do all the chores every day because how can you be expected to be a mother if you can't handle a little work."" He wasn't yelling or anything, he was talking to me quietly like a was 2 inches tall. 

I was shocked because I had never heard him say anything like this. The rant went on for about 30 minutes before I interjected and asked ""Well what do you plan on doing to help me with all of this."" He then got extremely defensive saying he works his ass of at his job to provide for me and what is going to be our future children. (For context I don't work atm, my job was not paying enough to justify me going so I am a full time college student) He ended by saying that it doesn't matter how I feel physically or mentally, it is a mothers job to push through, and if he helped and babied me I wouldn't be a good mother.

I got extremely upset and started yelling and I said that ""I wish I would've known this is how you felt before I got pregnant with your baby."" There was a moment of silence before he started crying and he left for the night to stay at his mothers house. He hasn't been back yet and my MIL and SIL have called me berating me and saying I broke Jakes heart with what I said and I need to apologize immediately, and until I do he isn't coming home. I don't know how to feel. 

So AITA for yelling at my husband after he said he isn't helping me with anything during the pregnancy because ""its a mothers job to deal with it""?

EDIT: First I want to thank you all for your responses. I'm sorry I haven't really responded to anyone specifically but I really do appreciate you guys. A few of you asked if I told my MIL and SIL what he said, which I did. They basically said I was being sensitive and all he meant was pregnancy isn't an excuse to be lazy, he meant no harm. ......ok. I am getting some things together and am going to be headed to my mom and dads house. My mom is furious with him and doesn't want me apologizing to him or talking to him without the situation either being recorded or having a witness. Regardless, I am ok and will be ok. I do appreciate all of you though, you have opened my eyes to many things I may have been ignoring or looking past over the years.",38270,sgawl2,"NTA. One thing that stands out is we aren't even talking about general housekeeping here. It's doing crap for a grown man he a should be doing himself (as it sounds like it's the lights he turned on himself.)

"AITA for telling my boyfriend's friends I make twice what he does, when they called me a gold digger and he didn't defend me?","I'm in a relationship with a guy who also works in tech. He makes 68k and I make 130k. I am a mechanical engineer at a robotics startup. He works at a more stable job doing programming at a large company. 

He brought me to meet his friends at a party and they asked me about myself. His friends mostly work in tech too and talked about themselves in terms of their jobs.

I told them I'm an hiker, I do archery, I love road trips and camping and riding dirtbikes, etc. Basically talking about my hobbies because work is just a way to get paid to do the shit I love. It's not how I define myself and it doesn't come to mind when someone wants me to tell them about myself. 

One of his friends asked about work and I said ""Oh gosh, I don't wanna talk about work at a party! Spent my whole day sweating my ass off in 95 degree heat trying to replace this busted ass motor just to find the replacement part was also fucked.""

I wasn't lying or trying to downplay that I have a good job, that really is how I spent my day, and I wasn't in the mood to talk shop at a party!  

Some other conversations came up casually that probably also made me seem poorer like me saying that car dealership repairs were a ripoff, and telling my boyfriend that my childhood neighbors trailer caught on fire and I was gonna visit and help her out

I wasn't doing it on purpose, I was literally just talking about my life, but I guess I gave the impression I was poorer

It got later in the night, everyone was getting drunker, and some of his friends (not close ones tho) were making jokes about me growing up in a trailer and being a gold digger. And being ready to jump to a richer guy. Really misogynistic shit honestly, since they don't even know me and seemed to just assume all girls are good diggers.

He didn't say anything. He later said it was because he'd smoked weed and gets quiet and has trouble carrying on a quick conversation when he's high. But regardless I felt hurt he didn't say anything. 

I got irritated with his friends and asked ""Now why the hell would you say that when I make twice what he does?"" His friends went quiet for a second and I continued saying ""There ain't no gold to dig here, not with him or anyone at this party. So do y'all think I'm cheap, or do y'all think I'm stupid? 

My boyfriend wanted to leave the party shortly after and he was pretty upset with me for telling everyone I make twice what he does. I said I would have held my tongue if he'd checked his friends himself. But he didn't say anything so I wasn't about to let them talk to me like that.

He said it was humiliating and now everyone thinks I'm a bitch, and I flippantly said ""at least they know I'm a rich bitch""

AITA for literally showing my dad how he behaves everyday when he gets home from work?,"My f16 father m46 is the ""breadwinner"" while mom is a sahm. She handles everything around the house like cooking, mopping, washing, laundry, etc. I'm the oldest and I try to help but really there's only so much I can do while my dad just gets home at the end of the day and literally complains about everything. like how the carpet isn't clean or how the food is cold.


As a result; I'd have to listen to a huge argument daily between him and mom. It's exhausting but honestly...I think that my dad is in the wrong here. I tried talking to him to get him to see how his behavior is but to no avail.


So what I did was pick a day off for him and pretend to act like him. I put together an outfit that looked like a suit and put black tape over my lips to look like a mustache. at 6pm. I went inside the house. Shouted ""I'M HOME!!"" then sat next to him in the living room and started kicking my shoes while complaining about the state of the house at the top of my lungs. He glanced at me confused asking what I was doing. I ignored him then started yelling about the carpet being dirty, shower not ready, the kids needing to be quiet and so on.

He kept staring while mom and my siblings laughed. My youngest brother kept pointing towards me saying ""this is daddy"". I then proceeded to yell about dinner then berated my mom for not preparing ut before time. My dad stopped me and in a serious tone asked what I was doing. I turned to him and said ""WHAT?! CAN'T A MAN EFFING REST AFTER WORKING LONG HOURS!!"" in the most macho voice I could muster. My dad got the hint because this was the common phrase he uses daily. He went quiet and avoided looking at me. I stopped the act and told him I was trying to show him what he's like everyday when he comes home from work. He said nothing, just went outside and refused to speak to me.


Later he went on about how I ""mocked"" and invalidated him. That he does work hard and me doing this was disrespectful and invalidating. Mom said it was funny but also thought I hurt my dad's feelings and I could've gotten the message across some other way instead.


AITA?",38005,xe62pq,"NTA first off but I think you have a good chance here.

Listen please - you can acknowledge “Hey dad, I know that probably did hurt your feelings and I’m sorry. Of course you work hard and provide for us and we appreciate it, but I want you to see that your behavior hurts moms feelings, hurts the family.”

The fact he went quiet, instead of exploding in anger, to me says there is hope! Like many, MANY dudes his age he struggles to process those emotions, but he recognized he was feeling more embarrassed / hurt than angry it seems. 

The key is to understand and withhold judgement, to re center the convo on not just his pain, but everyone’s feeling pain, and moving forward.

That’s tough, and you’re a kid, it’s not your responsibility to do it. You would be morally justified to say F off. But I always ask do you wanna win, or be right? 

Being right often feels hallow. I hope you win!

AITA for telling a guy what I do for work and letting him pay for my drinks during the whole evening?,"EDIT TITLE : AITA for NOT telling a guy what I do for work and letting him pay for my drinks during the whole evening?

----

My friend ""Grace"" invited me to a board game bar to play and have drinks with her, her boyfriend and one of their friend's ""Nick"".

We went to get drinks in pairs, Grace going with her boyfriend, meanwhile Nick and I stayed at the table and vice versa. So Nick and I had plenty of time to talk just the two of us. 

Nick started the night by telling about his recent career change, he decided to quit his previous job, go to a coding bootcamp and he got a job as a developer one or two months ago. He was very proud of himself and his new salary and told me this multiple times. 

He never asked me what I do for work, but talked about his new job quite a lot, occasionally saying ""sorry, you don't understand that, haha"". During the entire evening, I never told him I has been working as a software engineer for the past 4 years, because he never asked and honestly, I found it a bit entertaining. 

When it came to the drinks, he invited me to every single one. ""Don't worry about it, it's not a problem with my devoper salary."" I told him multiple times he doesn't have to pay for me, but he insisted. 

At the end of the night, when we were saying our goodbyes, he took out his phone to send me a friend request on Facebook. My job is listed in my profile, so that was when he realized that I'm software engineer. 

He asked me if it's true that I'm a software engineer and I answered yes. He asked me why I haven't told him, why did I let him believe I was a cashier like Grace used to be (?? I never implied that), and why did I let him pay for everything when I probably earn more than him. 

I told him that he never once asked and it was his fault he assumed. He could have simply asked me about my job, but he only wanted to brag about his. But if he wants me to, I can pay him back for the drinks. 

He was a angry and said I made a fool out of him. I think he did that, not me. But now Grace and her boyfriend are on his side too, saying that it would've cost me nothing to tell him early in the evening and I only kept it for myself for my own entertainment. 

Well, I did find it entertaining, but I don't really feel like I did anything wrong. AITA?",37674,uzip5a,"Nick was bragging. You played along with it.

AITA for moving my son into a rental apartment after finding out that his dad's been cancelling his job applications?,"
My son ""Aiden"" (23) moved back in with us upon graduating college as my husband wanted. My husband's original plan was to have Aiden live with us for free, but stay home and help with his disabled younger brother (16). Aident started complaining about needing money and wanted to find a job. My husband was against this and even offered to double his allowance but Aiden was growing tired of staying at home.


So he began looking for jobs here and there for over a year but non of his job applications came through. He'd just apply and they never get back to him. We were confused by this til recently, I found out that my husband was behind all the job applications being cancelled. He'd wait tol Aiden applies then he proceeds to cancel the application by impersonating him and using his email. I blew up at him for this but his justification is that he's just trying to make sure that our younger son is cared for by Aiden and said that Aiden has been big help and him getting a job will affect his care for his brother. I went ahead and rented an apartment for Aiden and told him to stay there til he finds a job and starts paying for it himself. Aiden was hurt upon knowing what his dad did. My husband was livid when he found out. He called me unhinged and said that I was separating the boys and teaching Aiden to become selfish and care more about a job than family. He also said it was huge decision for me to rent an apartment without even running it with him.


He's been giving me hell about it and is calling me a terrible mother for encouraging Aiden to be selfish and selfcentered. He said I needed to see and understand why he did what he did.


[Edit] few things to mention:

(1) My husband says that since he and I have health issues then we could use Aiden's help.

(2) When I suggested outside help, my husband refused saying he won't ask anything from anybody and that his son is his problem and no body else's.

(3) I used money from our joint account to pay for the rental apartment.

AITA for refusing to punish or allow my wife to punish our son?,"This all started back in March. My son's best friend turned thirteen. In his family, thirteenth birthday is a huge deal. In addition to a massive party (which all four of us were invited to) his parents also took him to Disney World. They invited my son to attend as well.

My wife was hesitant to consent to this. She said it was unfair to allow our son to go when our nine year old daughter can't. Especially since she loves Disney and princesses. I said that our kids won't always have the exact same opportunities, and if we set a precedent here, we'll have to stick to it if and when our daughter gets a similar opportunity. So we'd just be punishing both our children needlessly. My wife reluctantly agreed that we should allow our son to go.

I gave our son money to buy his sister souvenirs. He did, and his friend's parents even bought extra stuff for him to give to her. Still, when she saw him come back wearing a Star Wars shirt with the Mickey hat and trading pin lanyard, she burst into tears. My wife later said we made a huge mistake and never should have let him go.

I (mistakenly) thought all of that was behind us. Now, we are not well off financially, but my BiL is, and he invited all of us to visit a beach house he rented for a summer send-off. My wife told me she wants to have our son stay with my dad and just take out daughter to ""even the score.""

I told my wife that isn't happening. We are their parents. We can't favor one child over the other. Not being invited to the birthday trip of a kid you barely know is in no way comparable to being left out of a *family vacation* and I'm shocked she would even suggest such a thing. I refuse to allow it. Now my wife is angry, but I don't care. I'm not punishing my son for being lucky. AITA?",37206,wcnh0v,"NTA. Die on this hill. You were 100% correct that your kids aren't going to receive the same opportunities in life. Daughter has to learn how to handle situations like this in life, because she's  not always going to be treated the same or have the same opportunities as everyone around her and she needs to learn to handle that with grace.

Also this is your family inviting you like you said, not a child's friend. Your wife would be excluding your son from his entire family, which is just awful. Let your wife be angry about this, she's completely out of line. What a strange reaction. I wonder what the root of it really is.

"AITA for doing weird/awkward poses whenever my MIL ""accidently"" walks in on me in the bathroom?","So, my MIL (I'm a gal btw lol) came to stay with us for few weeks til her home is renovated for christmas.


The problem is that she has been randomly walking in on me while I'm in the bathroom. Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking up on her behavior after the second time in a week.


She'd barge in, then turns and says ""oh sorry"" then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said ""so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!"". He seriously said that!.


We have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5.

So I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she ""accidently"" barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first seeing her initial confusion but she told my husband about it claiming ""she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom"". I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel ""terrified/weirded out"" by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games.


Edit. Lol. Um what? I just came back on here and saw literally 1000s? of people? OMG now I feel embarrassed Glad I went anonymous Lol. But seriously...I'm looking at my screen and am like ....I'm famous? Seriously though...My husband and his mom are extremely upset with me. He still thinks it was ridiculous and is demanding an apology before she goes back to her home.  I'm not sure if I will apologize because yes while it was a ""me problem"" that I couldn't use the lock. It's still feels wrong what she did and maybe I'm wrong too but at least I got (so did you apparently lol) a bit of a chuckle out of it 😅🤣 also, I'm sure Thanksgiving dinner will hella awkward tomorrow.

AITA for embarrassing my FIL after I repeatedly asked him to explain his joke to me?," I (27F) used to be an ''*escort*'' (h\*oker) from 18 until I was 23, I'm not proud of it but I also don't give a fuck because I did what I had to do to keep studying and a roof over my head. That's how I met my now fiancé (37M) tho he was never my client.

We began to date when I was 25 and three or four months after that his BIL ''exposed me'' (no idea how he found out) because *there's no way my fiancé knew* and thus we had to come clean in front of his whole family. Yes I did that. Yes he knows. Yes he doesn't care. It was 2 years ago (at that time), we got over it. After that there was a span of 3-4 months in were my MIL and some of my fiancés aunts and cousin ''police'' their husband when I was around, it was really weird tbh because this dudes were like 40-60yo and I wasn't that desperate, so my fiancé shut their bullshit hard and even when his family still gives me the side eye from time to time, we thought it was behind us.

He proposed last year and five months ago we found out that I was pregnant, we were really happy about it and we told his family as soon as we knew. His sisters and young brother were happy for us, but his mom took me aside and *begged* me to be honest with her and asked if this was really my fiancés child, I was taken aback but I just rolled my eyes and said yes, she gave me some shitty speech about how ''she only wanted to make sure'' and that ''she was happy to be a grandmother''.

Well, last weekend we were at his parents with his family and some of his friendsand we were talking about the name, how he might look (small talk, we will love him regardless but there's always some ''*Oh I hope he gets your nose!*'' ''*mmh I like your eyes, I hope he gets them*'' comments) and my FIL said that he and his children have a birthmark in the inner tight and that even his grandchildren (one of my SIL's kids) got them, so our baby might too, and then he said ''But how can we know from who he got it? it may as well be from me, my boy or my brothers'' and he and his brothers began to laugh. My fiancé got mad and before he could say anything I said ''I don't get it'' and my FIL was ''yeah because it runs in the family'' and I said again ''I don't get it, why would he get it from you?'' and he began to get nervous and said ''because you know... it's just a joke OP'' and I said ''but I don't get it and you all laughed, explain'' it got to the point that some of his friends said ''hey, it's not funny'' so he he excused himself and left. 

Later my fiancé's BIL came to me and said that I was wrong for embarrassing him like that in his own house and that I knew what the joke was about and *because of my past*, I shouldn't be surprised. Now they're all demanding that I apologize to my FIL.",36632,tripxr,"NTA.  Look blank and continue to ask for an explanation.  I don’t understand.  Why should I apologize?

"AITA for not giving up my second ""free"" seat next to me in the plane?","I am obese. Like I am comfortable having two seats in the plane type of obese. I am well aware of that and I really don't like to bother people with my weight. 

A week ago I was going to a conference by plane and because I was going alone (usually when I fly with my boyfriend I don't buy two since he sits next to me) I bought two seats. I fit in one but my side is usually touching the person next to me and I feel uncomfortable for them. It happened to me that they gave me nasty looks and I felt extremely uncomfortable the whole flight. 

So I sat down in the plane and put the armrest up so I would be really comfortable. Some couple came and they both sat next to me because they got separate seats and they noticed the seat next to me was empty. Exactly what I was afraid of happened. My side kept touching the guy next to me and he even pushed me a bit when he moved in the seat. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable and asked him if he could go to his seat because I bought this one for my comfort. He told me no, since the seat is empty and he wants to be with his girlfriend. Well, I told him I understand but I feel uncomfortable and I paid for the second seat so exactly this doesn't happen. He refused again and started to chat with his GF. I called the flight attendant and quietly told her what is happening. She asked the guy to leave my second seat and he and his GF gave me a nasty look. The GF mumbled something like ""Fucking fat bitch"" under her breath but nothing directly to me.

AITA for getting upset and telling my dad his girlfriend didn't buy me a Starbucks drink?,"I (17F) have been living with my dad (45M), his girlfriend of 2 years (33F), and her daughter (13F) for a couple of months now while my mom (40F) is visiting my sick grandfather in Sweden. I've only ever stayed at my dad's on weekends so it's been hard getting used to living with his gf and her kid full time. The kid is super whinny and pretty spoiled because gf dotes on her so I usually just stay in my room.

Today gf was taking her daughter on a ""special outing"" because she passed a math test, and my dad suggested I go with them for a ""girls day out"". I wanted to say no but I knew that he wanted me to get to know his gf and gf's daughter better so I agreed. He gave gf $300 to spend during the outing.

We spent the day going in and out of stores gf's daughter liked in the mall complex. Gf ended up buying her a shit ton of clothes, makeup, and other stuff I don't remember. On our way back home gf stopped at the Starbucks cause daughter wanted a drink and some cakepops. She ordered a drink for her and her daughter and 2 cake pops. I asked her if I could get something and she said she ran out of money and she'd ""get me something next time"". When they got their order I asked if I could have one of the cakepops and gf said that it was her daughter's treat for hard work and it would be wrong for me to take one since ""I didn't do anything that deserved being rewarded"".

I'm not gonna lie, I was pretty upset. When we got back home my dad saw their drinks and asked where mine was. I told him that ""I wasn't allowed to get one cause I don't deserve it"". His gf got upset and said I was twisting her words and the daughter just said I was being greedy and was jealous of her.

AITA for telling my parents that they ruined NY celebration after they kicked my husband out over a joke?,"
I've been married to my 2nd Husband ""Mike"" for 4 years now. He's a jokester and loves to crack jokes all the time. He especially like to joke with my brother ""Ethan"" and his wife. Ethan used to be okay with it til he started complaining about Mike taking it too far with his jokes.


Some context about Ethan. He and his wife couldn't have kids so they adopted a boy ""Joey"" 2 years ago. Mike has been making silly, lighthearted jokes that involving Joey's bio parents as a way to mess with Ethan and his wife. I already talked to Mike and I tell you that he's 100%means no harm and he was just trying to get them to react.


So fast forward to NYE, my parents hosted a big celebratory dinner and Ethan and his wife came. While we were eating dinner, Mike decided to tell a knock-knock joke to Ethan. He said ""Knock knock.."" Ethan laughed and said ""Who's there?"". Mike replied ""Joey's bio parents"" then he bursted out laughing. Silence took over and Ethan's facial experssions changed. His wife called Mike an ""idiot"" to which Mike replied with ""Hey...Relax it was just a joke"". An argument ensued and dinner was paused. My parents suddenly told Mik to leave which I thought was too harsh. I tried to speak to them and get them to calm down but mom insisted that Mike leave. We left and Mike was complaining the whole time about how they overreacted. I called mom later and she told me Mike was out of line with his hurtful jokes about this touchy topic and told me I was wrong for defending him and saying he was just joking. She said he ruined NY for the family but I told her it was her and dad who ruined NY celebration for escalating the situation and kicking him out. I told her he could talk to them but again they were the ones who ruined NY celebration. She called me delusional for this statement and hung up.


We haven't talked to them for days. I tried contacting Ethan but no response.",36166,1031mvi,"YTA.

What if someone took your greatest insecurity and poked at it. Over and over and over and over again. Like some shitty, hurtful groundhog day. 

And when you said something about it, they would tell you ""Well, calm down, it's a joke.""

Would you like that? I don't think so.

Your husband is nothing more than a cruel, mean bully. And you are his enabler.

Also, ""Mike"" isn't just hurting the parents, he is hurting the kid as well and that makes it even worse.

AITA flipping out on my fiance for cancelling all the vegan food options from our wedding food menu behind my back?,"

My fiance (31 male) and I (25 female) are getting married soon. There wasn't much that disagreed on during the wedding planning except for food. Me and my family are vegans, and there so many reasons why we chose this lifestyle and one of them being that we have a history of health issues. My fiance and his family are the complete opposite. they're hardcore meat eaters which is fine by me obviously.

However, When deciding on the wedding food menu, I wanted to add 4-5 vegan options. My fiance and his mom objected saying it was a waste of money over food that 'isn't real food'. They also argued that this would be offensive for 'their' guests and suggested my vegan options just be ""the good ol' salads & appetizers"" (his mom wanted cupcakes lol). I said no because for one it's me and my family who's paying. and two I want to make my guests feel welcome and not be treated as second class citizens by being served ""salad"". my fiance made a face and said ""isn't that what vegans eat?"". I refused to argue about it and said it was final.


The other day, I found out that he had cancelled all the vegan options and took them off the menu completely and behind my back. I was seething. I called him at work but he kept hanging up on me. I went straight to his workplace and confronted him there and just flipped out on him. He was stunned to see me. He at first said it was his mom's idea then told me to go home because I was making a scene at the office. the fight continued at home and he defended himself by saying that I sort of made him resort to doing this after I kept brushing off his thoughs and input, and refusing to accommadate his family. but there were PLENTY of meat options why why can't I get 4-5 vegan options? when I'm paying for it?. He yelled that it was his wedding too not my family's. My family said it was fine and they'll figure it out and told me to let it go but I refused.


AITA for putting my foot down on this?

UPDATE: So his mom messaged me earlier to try to get me to listen to what she had to say after I kept ignoring her phonecalls. She spent long walls of text just to ""address"" what I did at her son's workplace, calling it all kinds of stuff from immature to unhinged. She then went to explain how she's noticed that me and my family kept ""acting dismissive"" of her son's input and ""contributations"" to the wedding. She said that she noticed my behavior towards him and her entire family and wanted to speak up earlier but didn't and tried to keep the peace. She then went on to address the food menu issue and denied her involvement in the cancellation of the vegan option but that didn't mean she doesn't support her son's decision. moreover, she thought it was soooo responsible of him to make that move because of my continual refusal to see how this stuff is waste of money. she also pointed out how I kept saying ""I paid for it"" and said that technically this isn't just my money, it's mine and *his* because we're getting married she suggested I wisen up and get rid of ""my money, I paid for it"" mentality. She finally mentioned how ""bad"" this whole situation is making me look, and said that she and her son had already offered a number of compromises that I chose to brush off and decided to make it my ""weird"" hill to die on. She said that not only her son is upset but she and ""the family"" are as well after hearing about it and suggested I just agrre on their compromise and be done with it. This pissed me off beyond belief I responded by letting her know that I'm still standing my ground on this even if I'll have to call the whole wedding off because of it because honestly? this is just ridiculous, it is!!! my mom and dad....they don't even know what to say anymore. Apparently, my fiance saw my response to her (he's with her) and is now trying to call me but right now I'm waiting on him to get home and see if he's still insisting on the stance he took.

AITA for taking my newborn son and going to my mom's house because my husband his mom didn't save me any food for dinner?,"



I f32 gave birth to my son 5 weeks ago. My husband's mom has been camping in the living room ever since and inviting people over, making a mess in the house, etc. I said nothing because if I open my mouth, my husband would start scolding me saying his mom is there to help and I should be grateful. What I did was ignore her and focus on my son.

I handle feeding, diaper change, cleaning, wiping. I only get a few hours sleep so my husband's mom isn't really helping with the baby. But I thought to myself ""well, at least she cooks for us!"".


Last night, I was in the bedroom breastfeeding my son. I knew I was late for dinner but I thought that my husband and his mom saved a plate for me. Once I got done with my son, I walked out the room and saw my husband and his mom sitting watching tv. I asked about dinner and my husband said it was ""probably"" on the stove. As I was walking towards the kitchen, his mom loudly said that she didn't save me any food. I was absolutely shocked I asked her why and she simply said ""Well, we didn't see you at dinner table so I thought you weren't hungry"". I lost it and yelled that I was feeding my son OF COURSE I was hungry, I was actually starving!. She shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her fault I didn't ""show up for dinner"" but she knew damn well that I was with my son and hadn't eaten a thing in hours!. My husband asked me to not raise my voice at his mom but I told him that he saw what happened and didn't think about me being hungry and needing food. he lashed out asking what the fuck I wanted him to do and I said ""I don't know, maybe save some food for me?"" She defended him saying it was selfish of me to basically berate him for eating his dinner after working for long hours at the department. An argument ensued and I went inside the bedroom, packed a small bag for me and my son, called my brother to come take me to mom's house and my husband blew up at me as I was making my way out. We argued at the door and he told me that what I was doing was uncalled for and childish. I told him I couldn't take his mom anymore, he said I should be ashamed of myself for talking about her like that after she literally put her life ""on pause"" so she could help ME out. My brother came and I got into the car and left.


He picked some food for me on the way and I ate like a hungry bear. My husband never stopped calling though. In his last text he called me ""nuts"" and demanded I return today but I said that I miss my mom, that I like it here in her clean home with her healthy food and would like to stay for a while. He's lost it and got his family involved accusing me of keeping his son away from him and punishing him over ""food"".



**Edit...Ok, to those who are saying that I'm keeping my husband away from his son, I promise you that he has full access to him but chooses not to come over simply because he hats my mom and refuses to be with her in the same room. How long am I going to stay here??? There's no telling but at least I'm being pampered and treated like a princess by my mom, dad, brothers - heck, I couldn't get this treatment in my own home!. As for my husband, He can come over to mom's house if he wants to see his son so badly but I doubt he'll do it since he's a very prideful person and this might hurt his ego.**


**one more question to answer cause a lot of people asked me to clarify. Yes, Department = Police Department. He's a police officer. I'm sorry if you got confused, but I thought it was clear.**








**Edit Ok, I felt sorry for him and decided to send him a couple of pictures that I took of our son sleeping and what was his respons? A long wall of text berating me left and right and claiming that I was rubbing it in his face that he ""can't come"" see his son because of you know what!!. He called me the b word which he never did til now and I'm shaken and so so mad right now because I really thought I was doing something nice and considerate after having sympathy for him. I've decided to get the rest of my stuff tomorrow because I need more time and space to be able to think about what he's done and said. I feel terrible right now but at least I got dinner for tonight, unlike when I was at my own home when his mom first came**


**Edit. OH MY GOD, I can't even find a place to start with this. So he just sent me a picture of him and his mom cooking dinner in the kitchen (it's nearly 7 pm here) saying that he was repaying me for the pictures I sent earlier and that they were making dinner and they were not including me ""for real this time"" ?????? I just....Oh my God I'm literally laughing like, seriously, what is this? I'm truly speechless!. I haven't responded to this (yet) and I don't think I will because I'm so angry right now and may just regret the words that I say to him. I'm gonna put the phone on silent or something for now because I don't want them to ruin yet another night but tomorrow I'm going to collect more of mine and my son's stuff so I could stay longer at my mom's house. Thank God I went anonymous with this and I might update later if anything new happens. Goodnight!**


**Edit. God I can't believe I'm back on here, but he just sent me a text saying he's only willing to come over IF I could get mom out of the house tomorrow, like literally have her leave her own house! He said it's just for 2 hours so he could see his son and also ""talk"" (he doesn't even know I'm coming over tomorrow to pick more stuff for me and the baby). I'm freaking out! Like absolutely no, not happening. I wouldn't dream of telling mom to leave her own house, that's crazy out of line request!!!. I'm not sure wether to respond or what I should say to him but I'll try to get some sleep then see how it goes in the morning!. I'm too tired to do anything but I Just wanted to put this here for those who just read my thread, I'll let you know what happens tomorrow. Aright!.**",35188,xicqfv,Sometimes I read things here where someone so clearly isn't the asshole and it depresses me. Girl he's manipulated you so bad if you're even questioning this right now.

Update: AITA for not making coffee how my fiance wants me to,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/nhzub1/aita_for_not_making_coffee_how_my_fiance_wants_me/)

So it's been about a year since I made this post. Whenever I read posts like mine on here, I'm always wondering, did OP leave that asshole, so for those of you who care, I left that asshole.

A lot of you were on the nose that this wasn't the only way that he was controlling. My ex believes that he's the smartest person in the room, so if you're doing something differently than how he would, then you're doing it wrong and must be corrected.

I'm not saying that everyone's responses to my post gave me a revelation and I immediately knew what I had to do, but it was a nail in the coffin.

I'm living within an hour of my parents now when before I was on the opposite side of the country. I have a job as a caregiver and am planning to go to grad school to be a social worker. I have a boyfriend who doesn't try to control every aspect of my life. When I go grocery shopping, I'm not stressing about accidentally buying the wrong brand of pasta (which was the right brand of pasta when we lived in a different state, I still don't get that) or juice that's from concentrate. And I've switched to pre-ground coffee because fuck you, I want to. None of this would've happened if I'd stayed with him.

So yeah, thank you to everyone who played a tiny role in helping me see what an unhealthy relationship I was in.",34859,ux172q,"Pre-ground coffee???

AITA for leaving my babies inside by themselves,"I (20) am a mother of triplets whom are only 2 months old. I never expected ever in my life that I'd be a mother to triplets so when I first became pregnant it was definitely the last thing in my mind. 

I'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online. 

Sometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.
My fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them. 

Being able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down. 

My fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me. 

I grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise.

So here I am wondering if I should apologize for my actions or if I am the A-hole in this situation.

~~~~~~~~~ Update ~~~~~~~~~

I decided to show my fiance this thread at first he was really upset with me for sharing our personal problems with strangers on the internet even though it's anonymous. 

But in the end when he had a chance to clam down and hear me and all of you guys out he actually apologized and promised me he'd be more involved with parenting and even is willing to take parenting classes which I'll hold him to that. 

I just wanna thank everyone for the support that you all give me it brought tears to my eyes (happy tears) seeing how supportive you all were to a stranger on the internet I don't think I ever received this much support before. 

I can't believe how much attention this post even got plus the award again thank you so much.",34374,109i1ro,"The whole purpose of the baby monitor is so that you can leave the babies in a room on their own. Being just outside the apartment door is no big deal (says a grandmother)

It sounds like you are overwhelmed. You need some help with the babies from time to time. Either the father needs to be home more or his family should help out. One baby is a lot, three have you completely outnumbered.

AITA For skipping Christmas with my parents since they won't treat me like an adult?,"I (F27) have been with my boyfriend (33) for almost two years now.  We will be getting married eventually but it's not a priority. 

My mom won't let us share a bed if we come see them for any reason.  When we came over this last summer my boyfriend suggested renting a hotel so we could have privacy and a comfortable bed. It drove my mom nuts that we bypassed her ittle rules.  She wouldn't drop it the entire time we were there.  She made me promise not to do that again.  

My boyfriend's mom and dad are retired to Mexico and they are really chill. So we made plans to come visit them over Christmas.  They are not Christian so they don't really care when they see their son with regards to religious holidays.  

We didn't tell my parents we weren't coming. My mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was going to hold to my promise not to stay at a hotel over Christmas.  I answered truthfully that I would not stay at a hotel.  

I am sitting here on the balcony of my future in-laws condo looking at the Carribean waiting for sunrise and enjoying the peace and quiet.  I made the mistake of going online yesterday and I saw a bunch of posts from my mom and my sisters about how I was a jerk for lying to them about my plans.  

I may have been a little tipsy last night because I decided to respond.  I said that it was ridiculous of them to try and tell me I couldn't share a room with my boyfriend, that I was keeping my promise by not staying at a hotel when we were there, and that if they planned on putting everything on Facebook I would be avoiding all visits for the foreseeable future.  

They took down their posts when people started crapping on them for trying to control me.  But some people did agree with them. 

Now they are texting me and calling to say I was an asshole for making them look bad.  I asked them if they were trying to make me look good with their posts?  They stopped for a while but there were more texts and voice mail this morning.   I'm kind of liking the idea of skipping out on the drama from now on. But I miss my dad and he is blameless in this. 

AITA?

#EDIT

I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of things that keep being repeated.  

1. How was staying at a hotel so we didn't break her rules not the adult choice?

2. How many of you guys fly across the country or drive for hours to just stay one night?",34040,zux4ny,"NTA.  Sorry to hear about your crappy situation!

I am seeing a bunch of comments about you needing to act like an adult, say what you mean, etc.  Life isn’t so cut and dried as all that.  I do agree that, maybe, that is one potential end goal.  There are lots of possible good pathways to follow, and only you know which one works for you personally, and for your specific circumstances.  

My guess is, you felt that you were faced with a few choices:  

1) Go to your family’s gathering, get treated like a child, stay in separate rooms, endure the oppressive environment for the duration.
2) Go to your family’s gathering, stay in a hotel, get treated like a villain, endure the ensuing shit storm.
3) Tell your family you are skipping Christmas with them this year in favour of your in-laws and endure the ensuing shit storm leading up to the holidays - get treated like a villain.
4) Do what you did - spend the holidays with respectful people in a wonderful setting, get treated like a villain by your family, feel some guilt about the deception by omission.

You took a step towards establishing limits with your family.  Hooray!  Good job 👍 Boundaries are awesome!  My guess is your family will not like the change and will rage against it, will try to make you believe your actions were not mature.  Keep going!  Time will tell what degree of contact with them appropriate FOR YOU, and what / when / how much you can safely share with them.

AITA for my reaction when I learned that my fiance returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom picked for me?,"My fiance M33, and I F28 are getting married in december. His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along.


I hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this ""vision"" she has for the wedding and how it should be.


She insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that ""she always pictured her son's bride in it"" mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her ""vision"" but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had ""envisioned"" myself wearing at my wedding!.


She got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and ""turned down"" her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked ""what process?"" duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom. He said that I should consider the dress his mom wanted me to buy especially knowing that ""both dresses weren't that much different anyway"" like she said but I told him yes they were different...like so much different.


Anyways, We argued about it then we dropped it. Yesterday I came home and found out that he had returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom wanted. I called him and he was straightforward about what he did and why he did it. I lost it and started screaming at him. He asked me to calmn down and really give this dress ""a chance"". I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him. He insisted I give this dress a chance. He went on and on about how his mom has a ""vision"" and good intentions and just wants what best for me as her future daughter inlaw.


Mom is livid and has been wanting to go scream at him and his mom but my dad said that this isn't worth ruining my relationship with my inlaws. He suggested I wisen up and ""go with the flow"" but is it too much for me to be able to pick my own wedding dress without being guilted about it just to keep the peace?. AITA for my reaction?

ETD Q & As

I'm editing in some answers to frequent questions I get.

A. The dress she picked wasn't all too crazy but just wasn't my type.

B. This issue started during wedding planning and there were other things...like way too many things we didn't agree on. but this ""vision"" has been there for...quite a while.

C. I AM paying for the dress obviously.

D. My fiance's dad is deceased. also, his mom suffered from multiple health conditions. Has no daughters but one only son.

E. He's still presisting...",33964,xly6yk,Your dad is wrong. This *is* worth ruining the relationship over. Marry him and get a lifetime of being treated this way. Is that what you want?

AITA for doing the same thing to my sister-in-law that she does to my son?,"So background: I (32f) have a brother, ""Dave"" (35m), who's married to ""Sarah"" (29f). They don't have children yet. I have a son who just turned four and a three-month-old daughter with my husband (39m). My husband and I live in Belgium most of the time, but we travel back to visit my family about once a month (in England). At home, we speak both English and French to our children (my husband is Belgian), and right now, my son is in this very sweet phase where he'll sometimes mix up the two languages and say a couple of words in English in a French sentence or vice-versa. This has never posed a problem to us, and even the staff at his nursery have reassured us that it's very common and they tend to grow out of it once they start at school.

My sister-in-law has decided that this is a problem, so when we're visiting my parents and she notices my son doing this, she'll correct him, but she does so really rudely, whereas my husband and I will just gently correct him.

Anyway, we're visiting at the moment and she's now decided that instead of correcting him, she's just going to start ignoring him when he does this. I sort of noticed her doing it when we arrived, and I thought it was odd, but assumed maybe she was just stressed (her job is quite intense), but it only really became an issue yesterday. My husband was talking to my dad outside and I was feeding my daughter in the other room, and I'd left Louis with Sarah and Dave. When I came back downstairs, Louis was crying, and I managed to understand that he'd tried to ask Sarah for a drink (he has a special cup he uses that he was holding, so it was obvious what he meant) but that she'd just ignored him. I asked her why and she explained that she wasn't going to reply to him unless he said the sentence correctly and that I shouldn't be ""ignoring my son's obvious speech issues."" For context, it's not that she didn't know what he wanted. She told me that she understood exactly what he was asking for, but that she was deliberately refusing because he hadn't asked correctly.

This really pissed me off, but luckily my husband came inside at that moment and pulled me away so we could calm down and settle Louis. That night at the dinner table, Sarah asked me to pass her something, but she said it in ""bad"" English (she IS English, I just mean that she asked for it in slang. Think, ""Pass *us* the peas, will you"". I had a bit of an epiphany and I just decided to totally ignore her. She asked again, and I did the same thing. My brother asked why I was ignoring his wife and I said that I'm not able to reply if she can't speak English correctly and that it's wrong of him to ignore her obvious issues with grammar.

Everyone's pretty pissed off with me and I admit it was incredibly childish, but she was needlessly being a dickhead to my baby.

Should I just apologise?

**Edit: WOW this really blew up. Thanks for all the comments and support, and thanks for all the ESH/YTA messages too. I'm not going to apologise to her, because, to be quite frank, I think she deserved it, but I will have a conversation with her and my brother before we leave to try and explain that, for one thing, it's completely normal, and, more importantly, that if she keeps correcting or ignoring my son, I'll be severely limiting their contact. Although I doubt if I'll ever leave him alone in a room with her again anyway.**

**To answer a few of the most common questions: When I said everyone was mad at me, I meant my brother, his wife and my parents (although, my parents don't agree with what Sarah's doing either. They're more trying to ""keep the peace""). My husband is entirely on my side, and when he realised what Sarah had done to Louis (he only saw the aftermath), he wanted to cut short the trip.**

**Sarah (and the rest of my family), only speak English, which I suppose goes some way towards explaining why she doesn't understand it. I do think it's a monolingual reaction because we've never experienced anything similar in Belgium.**

**One final thing - lots of questions about why we're in the UK so often. My husband has to be in London for his job about once a month/ once every six weeks, so we tag along. I freelance, and a few of my clients are UK based, so it's a good opportunity for me to fit in a few meetings too. It also gives us the chance to bring Louis and Misha over to see my parents before Louis starts school, and we have to cut down on the visits.**",33718,xxznvl,NTA… this is genius and I love it. I speak 3 languages and grew up learning them. At age 3 I interspersed words of all the languages and got my lowest grade ever (in nursery school) because my nursery teacher was like Sarah. Years later this behavior is considered normal of a child becoming fluent in multiple languages and they do sort it out by the time they are school age. What’s Sarah’s excuse?

AITA for refusing to ''see other options'' for a girl and pressing charges for what she did to my son's car?,"My (39M) son (17M) Bryce dated our neighbor Lana (17F) for a year, they broke up mid Jan for reasons I don't know. I won't sugarcoat this, I never liked Lana, she always seem a little unhinged, controlling and aggressive, she's always demanding Bryce's attention and there were quite a few times when she showed up on our house our of nowhere (whether it was 7am or 11pm) because Bryce wasn't answering his phone, screaming and calling him a cheater when it wasn't like that. The thought of our son getting abused by his gf made us worried so much.

My wife and I tried to talk him out of that relationship, we said how that it wasn't normal nor healthy, we didn't want to force the break up because we feared Lana would lash out to him so we tried to do it in an sneaky way, we don't know if it worked but they ended up breaking up. 

He said that after he broke up with her Lana didn't contacted him which was weird because he expected her to go nuts but I told him that if fate didn't gave him shit he better not tease it. Now the problem is that we bought my son a car for Christmas, nothing fancy but enough to get him to school, his job and eventually college, he parks it in our driveway outside our home. Ever since the month began we had been founding scratches all over the car, we know Lana was doing it but since it was minimal my son decided to not do anything even if we could prove that it was her (we've CCTV). Still, something smell bad for me so I decided to switch one of the cameras facing his car directly just in case. 

Well, two weeks ago we got up and we found my son's car covered in a lot of shit: paint, glue, feathers, confetti, the door handles were wrecked, flat tires, paint all over the windows, you get the picture, Bryce and my wife were so distraught. We called the police and I handled them the CCTV that showed Lana and her brother (23M) destroying my son's car. We pressed charges and needles to say, Lana's brother went straight to jail, but since she's still a minor her parents want to make a deal but I refused. I don't think she should get a way out, before the police was here she was laughing her ass off and she tried to play it cool, if she thought this was funny then she's old enough to face the consequences. My wife and I want to stand our ground, they said they'll buy my son a better car and put Lana on therapy but is not enough. AITA?",33508,t2z9oa,"NTA

AITA for cancelling the entire trip after finding out that my husband hid my daughter's passport?,"
My husband and I have been together for 3 years. He has 3 kids from his previous relationship and I have one. She's the oldest (17). He's a dedicated man, puts God first and loves everyone.


My husband always complains that my daughter doesn't spend time with her stepsiblings or him but she has reasons for that and that is school, health issues and work. She does her best to spend as much time with them as she can. but she on the other hand complains that her stepdad tells her to basically take on the role of a babysitter whenever she's with her stepsiblings. My husband denied that and said that my daughter was making up excuses to not have to spend time with his kids.


For this issue, I figured that a family trip is what the family need to get together and spend more time around each others. My husband liked the idea but said that his kids are now ""uncomfortable"" around my daughter because of her ""attitude"" and suggested we let her stay home and have the house all to herself since that's ""what she always wanted"". I told him it's best that we all go. he kept complaing til I snapped and told him to stop


I booked (paid) for the whole family. However, my daughter told me she couldn't find her passport. We turned the house upside down looking for it but couldn't find it. My husband said maybe it was a sign from God that we should let her stay home so the trip wouldn't turn into a disaster. I ignored his comment but later while I was cleaning his office I found the passport, tucked away in the 3rd drawer under a ton of papers. I was floored by this, I confronted him with it and he swore he had no idea why or how the passport got there. I checked the upstairs camera and saw him enter my daughter's room. That was it for me, I screamed my head off at him then cancelled the whole trip completely. He started arguing saying I overreacted and that he didn't want his kids to be ""miserable"" on the trip and that willing to apologize to my daughter if and *when* I reconsider my decision regarding the cancellation of the trip, because my stepkids will be devastated but I said it was final and that it was done.


He become cold and distant and said that he wants to take some time to do some fasting and get guidance from God about how he should deal with the disrespect and control I had displayed lately.


AITA for cancelling it altogether?",33493,xe09ej,"NTA.

If your husband wants to take this issue to God, allow me to help him get started.

""Lying lips are abomination to the LORD . . ."" Proverbs 12:22

""Thou shalt not steal."" Exodus 20:15

He stole from your daughter and he lied about it. Now he is trying to fault you for ""disrespect"" and ""control""?

What about the disrespect he showed to you and your daughter? What about the control he displayed by deliberately trying to exclude your daughter from a family vacation, and lying about it? What about the disrespect he showed your daughter, presuming to decide for her that she would prefer to stay home from the family vacation? (Which, let's face it, was the ostensible reason. It wasn't what your daughter wanted. I don't even believe it's what his kids wanted. It's what ***he*** wanted.)

Please tell your husband for me that he does not love God. God is just an excuse he uses to justify some really horrible, manipulative, controlling, dishonest and disrespectful behavior. Seriously, please tell him for me. Show him my post.

His conduct was absolutely disgusting. Made even more so by the fact that he's trying to make it look like ***you're*** the one who has the issue. Like ***you're*** the one who's being controlling and disrespectful. I rarely see, in this subreddit, such clear instance of projection, especially of this magnitude.

Why believe a single thing he says now? He's proven that he is manipulative and will lie right to your face. I have no doubt that what your daughter says is true: that he really does try to use her a baby sitter every time she gets together with her step-siblings.

And save that video footage, and get all the proof you can. And if your home cameras happened to capture him lying about it, save that, too. If this goes to divorce court, you'll need all the proof you can get.",6784,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xe09ej/aita_for_cancelling_the_entire_trip_after_finding/,"['husband', 'together', 'years', 'has', 'kids', 'his', 'previous', 'relationship', 'one', 'shes', 'oldest', 'hes', 'dedicated', 'man', 'puts', 'god', 'first', 'loves', 'everyone', 'husband', 'always', 'complains', 'daughter', 'spend', 'time', 'stepsiblings', 'has', 'reasons', 'school', 'health', 'issues', 'work', 'does', 'best', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'hand', 'complains', 'stepdad', 'tells', 'basically', 'take', 'role', 'babysitter', 'whenever', 'shes', 'stepsiblings', 'husband', 'denied', 'said', 'daughter', 'was', 'making', 'excuses', 'spend', 'time', 'his', 'kids', 'this', 'issue', 'figured', 'family', 'trip', 'family', 'need', 'get', 'together', 'spend', 'time', 'around', 'others', 'husband', 'liked', 'idea', 'said', 'his', 'kids', 'uncomfortable', 'around', 'daughter', 'because', 'attitude', 'suggested', 'let', 'stay', 'home', 'house', 'since', 'thats', 'always', 'wanted', 'told', 'its', 'best', 'go', 'kept', 'complaing', 'til', 'snapped', 'told', 'stop', 'booked', 'paid', 'whole', 'family', 'however', 'daughter', 'told', 'find', 'passport', 'turned', 'house', 'upside', 'looking', 'find', 'husband', 'said', 'maybe', 'was', 'sign', 'god', 'let', 'stay', 'home', 'trip', 'turn', 'disaster', 'ignored', 'his', 'comment', 'later', 'was', 'cleaning', 'his', 'office', 'found', 'passport', 'tucked', 'away', 'rd', 'drawer', 'ton', 'papers', 'was', 'floored', 'this', 'confronted', 'swore', 'idea', 'why', 'passport', 'got', 'checked', 'upstairs', 'camera', 'saw', 'enter', 'daughters', 'room', 'was', 'screamed', 'head', 'cancelled', 'whole', 'trip', 'completely', 'started', 'arguing', 'saying', 'overreacted', 'want', 'his', 'kids', 'miserable', 'trip', 'willing', 'apologize', 'daughter', '*', '*', 'reconsider', 'decision', 'regarding', 'cancellation', 'trip', 'because', 'stepkids', 'devastated', 'said', 'was', 'final', 'was', 'done', 'become', 'cold', 'distant', 'said', 'wants', 'take', 'time', 'fasting', 'get', 'guidance', 'god', 'deal', 'disrespect', 'control', 'displayed', 'lately', 'aita', 'cancelling', 'altogether']",husband together years has kids his previous relationship one shes oldest hes dedicated man puts god first loves everyone husband always complains daughter spend time stepsiblings has reasons school health issues work does best spend much time hand complains stepdad tells basically take role babysitter whenever shes stepsiblings husband denied said daughter was making excuses spend time his kids this issue figured family trip family need get together spend time around others husband liked idea said his kids uncomfortable around daughter because attitude suggested let stay home house since thats always wanted told its best go kept complaing til snapped told stop booked paid whole family however daughter told find passport turned house upside looking find husband said maybe was sign god let stay home trip turn disaster ignored his comment later was cleaning his office found passport tucked away rd drawer ton papers was floored this confronted swore idea why passport got checked upstairs camera saw enter daughters room was screamed head cancelled whole trip completely started arguing saying overreacted want his kids miserable trip willing apologize daughter * * reconsider decision regarding cancellation trip because stepkids devastated said was final was done become cold distant said wants take time fasting get guidance god deal disrespect control displayed lately aita cancelling altogether 
AITA for giving my dad his money back in front of his other kids and telling him he was no longer welcome at my graduation?,"My graduation ceremony is being held next week. My dad had given me some money in advance to pay for the party. I live mostly with my mom but they were supposed to be hosting the event together.

Dad and I have a rocky relationship. After my parents divorced when I was 4 they split custody of me and he was able to stay a good dad. When I was 10 he met Jane. Jane had three kids, twins and a single kid. They got married when I was 12 but I would say even before that I felt like he prioritized her kids over me a lot. He would cancel plans with me if they wanted to do something and would either do the thing with them or force me to go and say it was even better than our plans, when for me it wasn't. Think going for a hike with me vs taking them to an indoor play area. Or seeing a movie with me vs the kiddie park. One more example is when I was given a ticket for a concert my dad and I both love. He was supposed to buy a ticket to come with me for some father/son time, but actually spent it on his youngest stepkid who wanted their room painted. He told me at the last minute and it hurt. There are other times stuff like this happened. He didn't show up at the hospital when I broke my arm because one stepkid was getting their tonsils out and wanted both him and his wife there. He told my mom over the phone to tell me he was proud of me for being brave and understanding, even though I never said that shit.

When I would bring this stuff up to him he'd tell me it was natural to feel jealous of sharing his attention. That was all he would say.

In 2019 he told my mom he would split the cost of a trip I wanted to go on with one of my clubs, because she didn't have the money all by herself. Mom had her half saved. We told my dad he needed to pay. He said bills were tight and it was the twins birthdays and the money needed to go on something for them. He told me we could do something as a family when the trip happened instead. I told him to forget it. That he was making it clear who was more important and I was going to stay with my mom where I actually mattered. Mom borrowed money to cover the other half of the trip.

Dad told me he regretted making me feel less important and we were working on things and then the graduation money was given about a month ago. Then a week ago he called and told me how one of the stepkids was being bullied, how bad of a time they're having it, and with that money they could help cheer them up for their birthday. I was pissed. I hung up. Then two days later I showed up at his doorstep, gave him the money and told him I didn't want to see him or his new family at my graduation, and that he had chosen who was more important so he better stay out of my life. His stepkids and two younger bio kids were there.  I didn't stick around. He called and told me we needed to talk it out like adults, and that I had hurt the kids feelings. His wife freaked out on me so I blocked her.

AITA?",33346,v4350c,"NTA, but I hope you go NC with him now. He's either gonna apologize with half nothings and say how sorry he is , and then do what he's always done, or he's gonna try and guilt you into apologizing for something that was never your fault in the first place.

You dont need such a shit father in your life tbh. He's made his bed. Let him lie in it. You are a strong person, and with this weight off your back you'll soar even higher.

AITA for taking my daughter and leaving the wedding after her stepbrother pulled her wig?,"


My daughter (16) Megan just finished her cancer treatment, she's lost her hair in the process and she's been incredibly insecure because of it. She no longer meets friends nor welcomes them at our home nor even meet family on person. It's been bad to say the least but her stepbrother (18) Ben has been making it worse with his nagging comments and jokes about her looks. He tried taking and posting pics of her secretly to share but I shut that down even though my husband thought it was just ""harmless teasing"".


My husband's sister's wedding was last week. The family wanted Megan yo go but she didn't want to. I spent so much time trying to help her and convince her to start socializing again and see family. She agreed under the condition that I let her wear a wig which I agreed, not only that but I took her shopping to pick her own wig and she looked beautifully stunning in her pixie hairstyle wig. My husband and Ben laughed when they saw it. I don't know why.



We went to the wedding and everything was going well til this happened. We were all sitting and we started talking about Meghan look, suddenly Ben reached out and pulled her wig and exposed her head. I was shocked I froze but Megan yelled then took her wig and ran. Ben, his cousins and some guests started laughing. I was upset especially when looked over my shoulder and saw my husband sitting next to his mom and laughing. I lost it on Ben and berated him infront of everyone then took my stuff, got Megan and got into the car and went home. Ben and my husband didn't have a ride home and my husband kept calling me but I didn't respond. He came home asking about me leaving mid wedding and upsetting his sister and then leaving him and Ben with no rude home. I argued with him about how Ben embarrassed Megan and humiliated her publicly which must've ruined what's left of her self esteem. He said that it was just ""kids teasing each other"" and that I overreacted and Ben had no malicious intent he was just messing with her. I said I was sick of it but he said that this is their way of bonding as stepsiblings and I was getting inthe way of it and being overprotective and unreasonable. We didn't talk after that and Ben is refusing to apologize and his dad is backing him up.",33164,w631jl,YWBTA if you stay married to this man.  I would be kicking him and his AH son to the curb.

AITA for revealing to my dad’s wife the real reason why me and him were never close?,"My dad practically gave me up to his sister from the moment I (27M) was born. My mom died when she was giving birth to me. And my aunt told me he never recovered from that because he blamed me for her dying. 

It hurt a lot as a kid that at family events he would ignore my existence. When I was a little older he got more vocal about me “killing” her and he can’t stand to look at my face. 

You can imagine the amount of therapy that put me in. I used to go to church crying because I was scared about going to hell for doing that to my mom. That’s how much his words fucked me up. But the shitty part was that I never stopped trying to be accepted by him. After my highschool graduation he told me to never bother him again since he legally has no obligation to me anymore (since he was sending my aunt money to take care of me). Around that time is when I finally started accepting that reality so from there we moved on with our lives. 

My aunt doesn’t talk to me about him. Sometimes my grandparents do and that’s how I found out he got married. They were mad he didn’t invite me to their wedding but to me it didn’t matter because we’re not close. But it was his wife who wanted to meet me. It’s the first time ever that he wants to make contact and it was to pretty much say she wants me on their life. She doesn’t know the real reason about why we’re estranged, he asked me to please not say anything and maybe this could be a way to reconcile after all. 

But he was only doing it for her. That much was clear when we talked. I never said I would be he still insisted on us meeting at their place because she really wanted to meet me. All she thinks is we were estranged for not getting along in my teenager years, going to college and losing touch because of “life stuff.” It pissed me off that he played it off as us just not talking for petty reasons meanwhile the actually reason damaged me for years. 

I told her the truth. Everything he said to me. That he was never a parent to me, that was all my aunt. It was definitely a shock for her. The outcome was a disaster. Everyone has heard about this now. My grandma’s in particular told me she understands my anger. But this was his chance finding someone since losing my mom and now it’s been put in jeopardy. 

My dad is devastated. They think it was going too far to ruin his marriage that way when he was willing to include me in their lives which could have been the start of our relationship. And they say not only did I ruin that but also possibly wrecked his marriage. She just doesn’t agree at all with what he did and it could’ve been avoided if I didn’t say anything. 

For me it was hard not to tell the truth after the lies made it seem like it was nothing serious. I couldn’t ignore what happened after what it did. Idk if it was the right call since it put their whole marriage at risk after all.",33026,tuydop,"NTA. Saying you lost touch due to tumultuous times as a teenager and distance in college is making the fault of your estrangement mutual. It was not mutual. He lashed out with horrifying, inaccurate and traumatizing language throughout your childhood and abandoned you immediately after birth. He is absolutely deserving of every complication his torment of you brings him. If he could not raise you or treat you with respect, he should have never associated with you. 

His wife was owed the truth because your trauma and abandonment were perpetuated up to and through their wedding. He was not just someone who couldn't raise their child due to his own trauma, he created trauma.

AITA for not letting my girlfriend wear her “unique” dress to a wedding?,"UPDATED! 

Throwaway account because she uses reddit. 
My (M25) girlfriend (F30) Nat has a very particular sense of style. Picture Harley Finkle from wizards of waverly place, you will get the idea. 
Don’t get me wrong, i never had a problem with that! In fact, i love the way she dresses because she loves to do so, and i am happy if she is happy. The thing is, sometimes she likes to incorporate memes into her clothes. No problem. It’s cute. But now she wants to wear a dress inspired on the meme “gay rat wedding”. To my friend’s wedding. He and his fiancé are gay. I told her, maybe that is not really appropriated? The dress in question would be full of little stuffed rats, pride flags and a big “I SUPPORT GAY RATS” on the front. 
My friend is not a big fan of the way my GF dresses and i think this dress may cause an certain uproar in the wedding. Now, nat is upset with me and claiming that i am “throwing water in her flame of creativity”. 
The wedding is next month, so she has plenty of time to think about another thing to wear. Should i just let her go with the dress? Am i the asshole in this situation?





UPDATE:

well guys, as many of you pointed out in the comments, me getting a throwaway account didn’t help. She found the post. Guess i was too specific after all. I will update soon




FINAL UPDATE:

Hello everyone! I would like to thank you all for your judgment, advices and opinions on my post, it was greatly appreciated! So… the conversation did not go well. She was livid with me for exposing her in this way, and although i showed her the comments (most important, the ones from the LGBTQIA community) she refused to admit that her dress was a poor choice, but in fact, her way to “appreciate the gays”. That did not sit well with me. Love can move mountains, but can NOT maintain a relationship with a homophobic. So, now i am going to the wedding a single, rat-free-dress, man! I did reach out to my friend and send him this post. He thought the situation to be hilarious, but if she did show up in the dress, he would def kick us to the curb. I guess this is all!

AITA for telling my soon-to-be niece that she doesn't need to wear a dress to my wedding?,"I (32f) am getting married to my fianc´é (41m) next year. After we got engaged, I suggested it might be nice if I asked my fiancé's niece (who's 15) if she wanted to be a bridesmaid too. I've only met her a couple of times, so we're not close, but she seemed like a cool kid and I thought it might be a nice way for us to bond/ get to know each other/ involve her in the wedding. (Side note - she's the only niece/ nephew on either side of the family).

Anyway, cut to a few weeks ago and we're in my fiancé's hometown to visit his family and discuss wedding-related stuff. His brother, sister-in-law and their daughter came over and I noticed this time that she was dressed a lot more androgynous than I remembered. The topic moved to wedding dresses and bridesmaid's dresses and I could see she was immediately uncomfortable. Her parents (her mum really) and grandma were making comments about how she'd need to be more feminine/ brush her hair etc, and how nice it would be to see her like that. I'll be honest and say this hit a nerve with me, as I was very much a tomboy as a teenager (even though I'm not anymore) and it absolutely broke me whenever my relatives would say things like that. Eventually, her mother made a comment along the lines of, ""It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once."" and she looked really sad/ embarrassed/ upset.

In response, because that *really* hit a nerve, I immediately told her that my maid of honour would be wearing a trouser suit for the wedding and not a dress and that I'd given all the bridesmaids the option of wearing anything they want as long as it's in the ""wedding colour"", to make things easier. I pulled out my phone and started showing her photos of the ideas my friend had sent me (a jumpsuit, culottes, a trouser suit, a tailored tux etc) and let her know that she could pick anything at all she wanted - she could even wear jeans and trainers if that made her comfortable – and that it's a wedding, not a fashion show.

My niece perked up a bit when I said that but her mum looked really pissed off. She's since asked my fiancé to pressure me into getting all the bridesmaids dresses so their daughter will have to wear one (which, lol, no). My husband doesn't give a shit what she wears, but obviously also doesn't want his family and me to be arguing on the wedding day. I don't want to back down because I know what it feels like to be pressured into wearing something that makes you uncomfortable, but on the other hand, I know it's only for a day and it'd make the family happy. 

AITA for trying to overrule her parents?",32688,uhde21,"NTA

She's 15 and is old enough to decide on how she would like to dress. 

You are being very reasonable by allowing her to be comfortable in what she is wearing, as long as it is meeting the wedding colour. 

The mum is an asshole for trying to make her daughter wear something that she would be uncomfortable.

"AITA for the email I sent to a teacher about her ""You have to include everyone"" rules, saying that was a dangerous lesson?","My daughter is 12, I'm trying to teach her ways of creating and respecting her boundaries that are age appropriate. Teaching her that it's ok to say ""No"" to things she feels uncomfortable with.

There is a boy in her class who keeps bothering her and her female friends at recess. I've encouraged her to go to me or her teacher when this happens.

My daughter told me a few days ago that in class, the teacher had asked the kids to form groups of about four or five. She had formed a group of five with some other girls, then the boy who had been giving her trouble at recess came over and said he was joining their group. Another girl said that they already have five, and he should work with a group who only have two or three people. 

He said no because the teacher had said ""about"" four or five. My daughter then said that they didn't want to work with him, and he should find another group. A few of the other girls agreed with her. He said that ""you can't exclude me like that, it's against class rules"" and she said she didn't care. 

I heard about this from my daughter first, and the way she talked about it, she had been firm but not unkind.

But then I got an email from her teacher saying she wanted to call. She said there had been an incident at school where my daughter had excluded another child, and that wasn't allowed in her class, and she wanted me to have a talk with her about it. Her telling of events was the same as my daughter's. I felt proud of my daughter for her honesty. 

I sent her an email saying..

Dear Mrs. (Teacher)

I'm sorry, but that is not a lesson I feel comfortable teaching my daughter. 

She's at the age where she is already having to deal with unwanted attention, and I'm making a point to teach her that she does not have to be around anyone who makes her uncomfortable. And that a young lady is able to choose to spend time with people who make her feel respected.

I understand you already are aware (Boy) has been behaving in ways that she feels uncomfortable with at recess, from our prior conversations.

I think it is a very dangerous lesson to teach a girl she has to include and be kind to everyone, instead of teaching her to be aware of when someone is not respecting her ""No"" and stepping out of the situation.

I hope I don't have to explain in too much detail why I find this important... But to put it briefly, I was brought up with the ""Include everyone"" mindset. No exceptions. It taught me to ignore my own comfort level, and as I became a young adult I became the victim of men who used my inability to say ""No"" to their advantage. It's a dangerous lesson, and no longer appropriate at that age. 

Thank you,

OP

She emailed me back asking for a meeting in person with the principal. I'm preparing for that but wondering if my email was too harsh

AITA for my response to my daughter's teacher?

////

Edit to update...

I reached out to the parents of the other four girls in the class who were involved, and we all coordinated to go speak to the school administration together. They had similar views, thinking it was inappropriate for the school to expect the girls work with someone who they're not comfortable with, and frustrated the teacher didn't do more to deal with the issues during recess that made the girls uncomfortable to start with. 

I ended up asking the school if we could reschedule the meeting to a time all the involved families could make, and we ended up meeting this afternoon along with my husband, another couple, two mothers, and a father. Along with the teacher and principal. 

We all presented a united front asking for the following...

The school does training for the teachers on trauma-informed teaching methods and the dangers of expecting young women to go against their best judgement of their own boundaries to be ""nice"". Instead of ""Include everyone"" the kids should be allowed to respectfully set boundaries and taught to respect each other's boundaries.

The school addresses harassment in class or at recess and doesn't enable it to continue. 

We went to talk, and I think it went a lot better having all the parents join instead of if I'd gone alone. The teacher and principal apologized and the principal agreed to look for resources on how to better navigate the balance between being inclusive and not forcing kids into including someone who is crossing a line with them.

Thanks a lot for all the amazing advice in the comments, I cannot believe how much this blew up and I'm so grateful to everyone who replied with advice and support.

AITA for getting my aunt and uncle kicked out of their house for not letting my husband and I sleep together?,"I (M27) am married to a man (M28). He is the love of my life. I had only ever dated women before him but when I met him I realized I was bi, and we fell in love. We got married in the fall of 2018, so it’s been almost 4 years. We now live in Vermont.

My whole family is from a small town in Texas, a super conservative Catholic area. I was raised there, but dad got a job in NYC when I was 15. The culture shock was difficult. We went from living in rural Texas to living in an apartment in Manhattan.

My parents didn’t sell our house in TX, they allowed our aunt & uncle who just had their 3rd child to move in while charging them a small rent. 
In college when I came out as bi, my brother and dad were very supportive. My mom needed some time to accept. The rest of my family reacted poorly at first but came around. 

During visits we stayed with my aunt and uncle at my old house, but because we weren’t married we weren’t allowed to share a bed. We didn’t argue, we both would rather make peace. Visiting since, instead of staying with my aunt & uncle we would rent a motel room.

During Covid we did not visit them. But this summer, my parents and bro decided to go visit my hometown again for 2 weeks, & invited my husband and I. I wanted a motel again but my aunt & uncle insisted my brother, husband and I stay with them.

The 1st night sleeping situation was being discussed after my cousins went to bed. My aunt & uncle wanted me and bro to take the spare bedroom, husband on couch. All 3 of us took issue with that. 

They snapped that we were not really married because we were gay, & that they had children in the house. They said that it would be a bad influence on their kids. This hurt my husband’s feelings and he started crying & ran out of the room. When my husband ran out, my uncle had the audacity to start laughing. That’s when I saw red. 

I started cussing them out so loudly that my young cousins came to investigate. I told them that if they didn’t go apologize to my husband immediately then I was going to tell my dad what just happened, and I was going to make sure to have them kicked out of the house — that was still in my parents’ name.

My bro seconded everything that I was saying. They started backtracking and saying that we were still welcome in “their” house but that we had to follow their rules, I responded that it wasn’t really THEIR house. I told them they were going to be homeless if I had my way.

The kids started crying cause they heard me say they were all going to be homeless, so we left. My husband was on the porch crying, I promised him that I would never subject him to that again.

I told dad what happened. To say that my dad was angry would be an understatement. He served them a notice of eviction for 60 days. I have been getting calls and texts and Facebook messages from my family calling me AH.

I want to know AITA for allowing my young cousins to end up homeless? Is it fair that they have to pay for what my aunt and uncle said to me and my husband?",32609,x74x76,"NTA

They insisted a hotel was not needed and then decided to disregard your marriage. The whole 'not married so separate rooms' thing was clearly an excuse before aswell.

It's entirely your father's decision who to let the house to, and you're within your rights to tell him what happened.

AITA for serving my husband's family Mac N Cheese for dinner?,"My husband (Asian) and I (american) welcomed our first born 4 weeks ago. The baby is health (Thank God) but I'm exhausted, haven't fixed my hair, barely able to shower and can not sleep.


My husband's family had been pressuring us to visit to meet the baby. I tried to hold them off as much as I could but yesterday, I was surprised to find them standing on the porch. turns out hubby invited them for dinner. I was embarrassed and felt like I wasn't ready for visitors (judgemental ones at that 😉) cause the house was a M.E.S.S y'all. Anyways, my husband sat with them while I fed my son then later I asked my husband if we should order take out for dinner. He said ""NO"" because his parents would find this rude and unwelcoming. He suggested that I go inside the kitchen and prepare something, anything long as it's ""homemade"". I said fine then went and made some Mac N cheese. The reason I prepared this meal is because of how easy it is.

Once I served the family, My husband's mom looked at me and was appalled. I noticed something was wrong. She asked if I really found it ""appropriate"" to serve her and the family Mac N cheese. I asked why not and she went on a rant about how disrespectful this was and that I clearly have no experience in what is right and wrong when it comes to hosting. I said excuse me? Who said I signed up to host an expected visit from them and she took it as in I didn't want them there. her husband said they were just there to finally see the baby that I kept them from seeing for an entire month. that's a whole month of his life they ""missed"" out on. We had an argument and they decided to go home. My husband said that deciding to serve his family Mac N cheese was more offensive then serving them nothing at all. I told him I was too exhausted to cook their ""traditional feasts"" that I was forced to learn from his mom. He took offense and said that I was being mean and disrespectful towards not only his family but his culture. I went inside the bedroom to stay with my son. My husband stayed on the phone with his family for an hour then kept giving me the cold shoulder and refused to eat what I cook in support of his family.

I understand how some guests might find it offensive especially his family. but I was just trying to make a quick homemade meal like my husband wanted. What's wrong with Mac N cheese?


EDIT* Ok, So I'm seeing commenters here offering to come over for some Mac N cheese. It's amazing to hear that some people here would aporeciate this kind of meal. It kinda makes me feel relieved and reassures me that I didn't mess this up entirely.

Come on in Y'all! I'll be more than happy to serve you some mac n cheese, some of y'all even offered to bring mashed potatoes and pizza. LOL would love to have y'all over some time.",32480,ucbdu0,"NTA

AITA for ruining my brother's marriage because his wife left me at the pool,"[UPDATE IS HERE,](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawaypoolproblem/comments/vznzde/update_aita_for_ruining_my_brothers_marriage/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) the mods wouldn't let me post because this post isn't old enough.

throwaway. this whole situation is so bizarre that I still can't really process it. it still doesn’t feel real but I feel scared and guilty

I (19F) had surgery a couple days ago to get all 4 of my wisdom teeth out and because I have a really bad fear of dentists, they had to drug me pretty hard to do the removal. Not like laughing gas that wears off really fast, but actual IV medicine so I was pretty much unconscious during the whole thing. They told me to have a ""responsible adult"" drive me to the appointment and back because the meds they gave me would make it dangerous to drive. My mom was on a work trip and couldn’t take me, so I asked my sister in law Bri (24, not her real name) if she could do it as the whole thing would only take an hour or two. I even offered gas money because the dental office is about 45 minutes away. I would have asked my brother but he works during the day while bri is a stay at home mom to their 2yo daughter who I think was at bri's mom's house that day.

Bri agreed to take me to my appointment and the surgery went fine, bri waited in the lobby for me to be done. When I came out of anesthesia I was very disoriented and nauseous, which I guess is normal. I had gauze shoved in my mouth to stop any bleeding and bri took me to her car after I was let go.

I don’t really remember much of the drive but it felt like not enough time passed before bri got out of the car and told me to come with her. I was really out of it and just followed her because the alternative was staying in the hot car.

long story short, we were at a pool?? I was really confused but once we were through the gate bri basically parked me at one of those little table-benches said she'd be back in a while. I was still trying not to puke and was really dizzy from the heat (90+ degrees) and the drugs, so I asked her to take me home but she wouldn't. I guess since it was her day off and she didn’t have my niece she was meeting friends at the pool. I was starting to feel really sick and on the verge of passing out or having a panic attack, so I called my brother. I don’t think he could understand me between the meds and the stuff in my mouth because he hung up and I guess called bri because she came stomping back over, cussing and yelling at me, and took me back to the car. I passed out on the drive home, but when we arrived my brother had left work and met us in the driveway. He was screaming at bri and she was crying. I was still pretty disoriented but my brother took me back home and stayed with me until the meds wore off. That's when he told me he's divorcing bri because of what she did plus some other things he didn’t go into detail about.

It's been a few days since then and bri has been blowing up my phone telling me what a bitch I am and how me tattling destroyed her family. Part of me feels bad because of my niece and I wonder if I should've jjst dealt with it and waited for her to be done at the pool instead of calling my bro and causing problems.

AITA for sending my coworker into anaphylactic shock?,"I'm at a loss here guys. Realistically, I know I'm in the clear. Legally, I'm in the clear. But I'm being vilified by my coworkers, and I'm genuinely considering quitting my job because of this mess.


So I work a pretty standard day job, and at night I help my friend at her restaurant, which serves an assortment of Thai cuisine. Tbh I'm insanely picky, but I fell in love with this peanut sauce the main chef makes, and he showed me how to make it, so about once a week I take it on either noodles or stir fry to my day job for lunch. People know this and a handful have tried it. It smells nutty, it tastes nutty. It's white girl pad Thai, basically.


Lately my lunches have been disappearing, or I'll open my lunchbox to find half of my food missing. I've tried addressing it, but nothing has been changing, and I was pretty sure it was one of the new hires that was doing it, but had no proof. Until now.



Thursday I took my noodles, and my entire tupperware was missing, which hasn't happened before. I'm pissed, but what can I do? A coworker shared her pizza with me and that was that, until today. My boss confronted me and accused me of poisoning my noodles because his daughter (one of the new girls) ""borrowed"" my lunch and had to be hospitalized. Turns out she's severely allergic to nuts, ate some and boom. Anaphylaxis.  She used an epi pen, had to be hospitalized and now her dad is trying to hold me accountable for her bills and condition, but I don't see it. Why should I pay? I don't mark my food as an allergen because I'm not allergic to it, she was just dumb enough to steal from me and eat something she can't have. 


But he's being hateful, and some of my older coworkers are icing me out because I warned him I'd report any harassment to HR if he tried anything funny. Brown nosers, I guess. My friend is aware and offered me a full time job, but I just can't help but feel it's unfair. At the same time, I could have killed his daughter tho... So, AITA?




Edit: holy shitballs this blew up!



I *did* email the HR rep and let her know of the situation. She's been on vacation and gets back tomorrow, so I don't know if she's aware of what's been going on since last week. I should note that I work weekends most weeks, not quite a 8-5 M-F job, but yeah. 



My coworkers mostly chilled out by the end of my shift, thankfully, after I explained to the (nosiest) friendlier person that I always bring a peanut sauce dish. I guess the general assumption was that I somehow found out who has been stealing lunches and decided to poison them?



To answer a common question: this was the first time my pad thai was stolen, and no I'm not the only victim of the lunch thief. I usually take a late lunch, and I'm not the only one, so I'm guessing the lady who was stealing food decided what was left is a free for all. F her. My boss said it was an HR issue when I'd tried talking to him about lunches disappearing, and HR always said they'd look into it (or further into it) and nothing ever happened. We're 100% not allowed to eat at our desks, unless you have a medical reason for it, so that wasn't an option either.



I'm assuming she's fine, but I don't know the severity of her allergy or how much she ate before she had her reaction. I'm not privy to her medical information, sorry guys.



Suing.... Sounds like a great revenge, but probably not worth the cost of a lawyer. My friend let me take tonight off to just bitch about everything, and I'm probably going to take her job offer. One commenter was right; even if everything settles down, I don't want to deal with a potentially hostile or reactive workplace like this anymore. It's not a  career with much room for upward mobility, and I didn't feel welcome in our group meeting today.


And for the people calling this fake, okay? It's not, but even if it were, why are you getting mad about it? Karma doesn't give me anything, monetarily or status. I can't exactly give out a bunch of details unless I want to dox myself, and the post seems rushed because I wrote it out of frustration during my lunch. Short time+word limit= rushed. Sorry it didn't meet your writing standards.



Anyway, I'll keep reading comments and responding occasionally, but this is it for me unless I get something worth updating. Thanks for everyone's opinions! (And the information about Caesar dressing and Worcestershire [thanks Google] having anchovies. That's crazy!)





Edit: the recipe




2 tbsp red curry paste 
3/4 cup smooth natural peanut butter
1/4 cup sugar
2 tsp dark soy sauce
2 tbsp cider vinegar
3/4 cup of water
12 oz of coconut milk


I cook it on med-low heat and add more water if it seems too thick. And use regular coconut milk!! The low fat isn't as good imo



I had to find one for home that seemed similar to the restaurant's since I'm not making enough for an army! I like this one, but I'm also lazy and want it done in 15 minutes. I hope everyone likes it! If not... Well, you tried something new


And the natural pb is important! Nuttier, stronger and far less sugar",32380,ulwow7,"NTA-  You didn't feed it to her.  She stole it.

>At the same time, I could have killed his daughter

No, she could have killed herself.  My wife had a heavy duty seafood allergy.  She wouldn't eat anything without knowing what was in it.   Like, Cesar Salad dressing has anchovies in it.  Other sauces are made with seafood to.  It can had in places you wouldn't expect.  So, she would never take someone else food (on principle first, because it's stealing) because it could be life threatening.

I would have thought that anyone with a severe food allergy would take the same precautions, but obviously not.

AITA for returning home after I found out that my husband booked 1st class for him and his friend while I got economy?,"

My husband and I 30s haven't been on a trip (out of coutry) for years. while he goes every year with his best friend. his reasons for going with him is because they both go to attend sporting events.


This year, my husband told me I could go with him and his friend since they were visiting a new destination. He paid for my ticket and everything else since I'm a sahm and have no job. the kids were left with my mom.


However. When I found out that he had booked 1st class for himself and his friend while I got economy. I just couldn't hold my tongue. I confronted him about it and he at first refused to discuss then when the argument got heated he yelled ""I PAID FOR YOUR TICKET FFS!!! ISN'T THAT ENOUGH???"" then kept on about how I should stop acting like I was ""royalty"" and that if I come to think about it, even economy is fine for me since I ""technically"" don't work anyway. I cried because of what he said but decided to just not go altogether. He changed his tone and started begging me to just go with what he planned but I declined. I went to pick the kids from my mom's house and he came back 3 hrs later huffing and buffing about what happened. His friend sent me a text calling me entitled, and said this was the reason why he didn't want my husband to take me with them and I just proved his point. I did not respond but I blocked him since he's gotten increasingly rude over the past few months.

He (my husband) said I keep crying about being excluded and this is what happens when he finally decides to include me. amitheasshole for not settling for economy? by the way he's perfectly capable of financing the trip.",32305,wg3euz,"NTA.

Your husband's attitude is out of line. I absolutely hate it when sole providers act like this, treating their partners like lesser beings who should be grateful for every penny spent on them. As a sole provider myself, it enrages me. It costs me absolutely nothing to treat my partner like an equal. Additionally, you could always run the numbers by him (how much full-time nannies and housekeepers make), and remind him as a SAHM you damn well have a job and provide a service he should be grateful for.

The argument isn't about you having to ride economy, it's the principle and what it implies. You are not worthy of first-class and you should be grateful he thought of you to begin with. What a joke. You were right to be offended and take a stand against this behavior.

AITA for not wanting coal for Christmas?,"This year I went to my fiancé’s house for Christmas. It was my first time going, as we would typically go to my family’s house instead. 

I got a (rather pricey) gift for my fiancé “Dan” related to his hobbies, I got nice gifts for “Dan’s” parents based off of things I’d talked about with them before, and I got a small pack of chocolates for each of Dan’s other relatives (I didn’t know them that well). 

I wasn’t expecting many gifts from Dan’s relative’s because I didn’t know many of them that well, but I was certainly expecting more than I got. 

At first, I was excited when I saw that there was a big pile of gifts for me. However, once I opened the first one it was just a piece of coal. Everyone laughed, and I just kind of laughed along thinking it was a gag gift and that the other gifts would be different. But every single one turned out to be coal. All 18 of them. 

I started to get upset, so I cried and lashed out at Dan. But he calmly explained apparently this is a longstanding tradition in his family where they gift coal to newcomers who are celebrating Christmas with them for the first time. He explained that it’s just easier that way since all the relatives who might not know the newcomer well don’t have to stress over finding a gift, and it’s a fun experience for the newcomer as well. 

I told Dan I couldn’t believe I skipped my own family’s celebration for this and left. But now Dan and some of his family are blowing up my phone saying I embarrassed him in front of his relatives and that I made it awkward for everyone. So aita?",32420,zzc58y,"NTA.

AITA for blowing up at my husband for messing with my alarm and causing me to miss my exam?,"

Hello! 

I f23 have been married to my husband m26 for a year. I'm in my last year of university and been so so busy for the last two weeks, with many projects and finals looming. My husband complains from seeing me studying and not doing activities together or hanging out with friends anymore. I've told him it's not gonna last forever and that I need to focus because this is my last year and it's been the hardest.



The day before the exam he wanted me to go with him to a friend's birthday party. I refused because I was busy preparing for my exam. he pleaded with me saying it's just one hour and talked about how his friends will be upset if I'm not there. I said no and shut down any further discussions. He got upset and called me selfish and inconsiderate but then dropped it.


Before I went to bed, I set my alarm clock like I always do since I'm a heavy sleeper+I stayed up late studying. The next morning I woke up at 9am. I literally freaked out and checked my alarm and found that it was set to go off at 9:30 am. I had no idea how this happened til my husband told me he did this to repay me for refusing to take one, one hour to attend the party so he took this hour from my time. I couldn't believe it I absolutely blew up at him just yelling and screaming at him left and right. He just stood there shocked from my reaction and my rage. I got dressed quickly and rushed to the university. 

They didn't let me into the exam hall. I got into a lot of hassle to get them to re-schedule the exam especially since I had no legit reason as to why I was late. It was awful is all I can say.


I went home and my husband and I stopped speaking to each other. He kept acting as if I hurt his feelings and traumatized him by yelling. And that I deserve what he did since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks. I might be wrong for not considering it but I think that my exams should be a priority and his way of ""teaching me a lesson"" was not right.",32215,vu7te5,That's a divorce level sabotage of your degree.,1266,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vu7te5/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_husband_for_messing/,"['hello', 'married', 'husband', 'year', 'im', 'last', 'year', 'university', 'busy', 'last', 'two', 'weeks', 'many', 'projects', 'finals', 'looming', 'husband', 'complains', 'seeing', 'studying', 'doing', 'activities', 'together', 'hanging', 'friends', 'anymore', 'ive', 'told', 'its', 'gon', 'na', 'last', 'forever', 'need', 'focus', 'because', 'this', 'last', 'year', 'its', 'hardest', 'day', 'before', 'exam', 'wanted', 'go', 'friends', 'birthday', 'party', 'refused', 'because', 'was', 'busy', 'preparing', 'exam', 'pleaded', 'saying', 'its', 'one', 'hour', 'talked', 'his', 'friends', 'upset', 'im', 'said', 'shut', 'any', 'discussions', 'got', 'upset', 'called', 'selfish', 'inconsiderate', 'dropped', 'before', 'went', 'bed', 'set', 'alarm', 'clock', 'like', 'always', 'since', 'im', 'heavy', 'sleeper+', 'stayed', 'late', 'studying', 'next', 'morning', 'woke', 'literally', 'freaked', 'checked', 'alarm', 'found', 'was', 'set', 'go', 'idea', 'this', 'happened', 'til', 'husband', 'told', 'this', 'repay', 'refusing', 'take', 'one', 'one', 'hour', 'attend', 'party', 'took', 'this', 'hour', 'time', 'believe', 'absolutely', 'blew', 'yelling', 'screaming', 'left', 'right', 'stood', 'shocked', 'reaction', 'rage', 'got', 'dressed', 'quickly', 'rushed', 'university', 'let', 'exam', 'hall', 'got', 'lot', 'hassle', 'get', 're-schedule', 'exam', 'especially', 'since', 'legit', 'reason', 'why', 'was', 'late', 'was', 'awful', 'say', 'went', 'home', 'husband', 'stopped', 'speaking', 'kept', 'acting', 'hurt', 'his', 'feelings', 'traumatized', 'yelling', 'deserve', 'since', 'was', 'frustrated', 'continual', 'refusal', 'attend', 'events', 'past', 'weeks', 'might', 'wrong', 'considering', 'think', 'exams', 'priority', 'his', 'way', 'teaching', 'lesson', 'was', 'right']",hello married husband year im last year university busy last two weeks many projects finals looming husband complains seeing studying doing activities together hanging friends anymore ive told its gon na last forever need focus because this last year its hardest day before exam wanted go friends birthday party refused because was busy preparing exam pleaded saying its one hour talked his friends upset im said shut any discussions got upset called selfish inconsiderate dropped before went bed set alarm clock like always since im heavy sleeper+ stayed late studying next morning woke literally freaked checked alarm found was set go idea this happened til husband told this repay refusing take one one hour attend party took this hour time believe absolutely blew yelling screaming left right stood shocked reaction rage got dressed quickly rushed university let exam hall got lot hassle get re-schedule exam especially since legit reason why was late was awful say went home husband stopped speaking kept acting hurt his feelings traumatized yelling deserve since was frustrated continual refusal attend events past weeks might wrong considering think exams priority his way teaching lesson was right 
AITA for walking out of the babyshower my InLaws threw for me?,"The situation is kind of a mess.

I (f27) am expecting my first baby with my husband. This is the first grandchild in the family (InLaws) and they said that if the baby's a boy then we'll give him my father InLaw's name (he's dead due to cancer). I had no problem with that.

This happened before we found out the gender of the baby - my husband and his family had me ""do things"" like attend prayers and do other rituals before the reveal at the drs. I didn't like that but went with it to keep the peace.

Dr appoitment came, and it turned out to be a girl. My husband cried in the car then turned his phone off to hide from his family then finally told them. His mom and the others made their frustration & disapppintment clear which bothered me cause my daughter deserves to be celebrated but, they ghosted me for days then started coming over & visiting constantly referring to my daughter as my son claiming the results were false and basically pretending it's a boy. I had severa fights with them after they refused to stop it, and my husband sided with them despite seeing how wrong and unreasonable what they were doing was. We didn't speak for a while

Sister InLaw called to apologize then inform me she arranged for a babyshower for me. I was so excited and happy. But when I arrived I saw blue balloons, blue cake with Father InLaw's name/decorations around. I was so confused I had to sit down. Sister InLaw explained they were ""still"" hoping the gender results are false and it's a boy. I looked at my husband and he agreed with her. I lost my temper and yelled at them all calling them delusionals and telling them to stop treating my daughter like she's unwanted and act like she doesn't exist by throwing a party for ""their imaginary grandson"". mother InLaw break down crying, I took my bag and walked out immediately.

They started yelling and my husband followed me outside and started arguing about how I insulted his family, and his dads memory by acting like that. I told him to wake up and see the insanity in his family's behavior. He said they needed time to process the fact that it's a girl not a boy as they expected and insisted I play along and ""they'll soon get over it"". I said absolutely not and demanded he take me home, he said no so I called an Uber and left. He was fuming he called 15 times, then texted that he won't be coming home til I ""get my ass"" over and apologize for ruining everything THEY'VE DONE FOR ME and accusing them of being mentally unstable. I haven't responded yet he's constantly pressuring me to get right with his family before we even talk about anything else.",31892,ts4qx0,NTA and they sound scary.

AITA for canceling the plans for thanksgiving after my parents called my brother’s baby their “first grandchild”?,"[update](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawayz_12345/comments/yy9a7e/update_on_canceling_the_plans_for_thanksgiving/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I (32f) have been with my wife Ava (34f) for 8 years now, but we’ve been married for 5. She was a single mom of three kids when we started dating, she had two daughters (now 10 & 12) and a son (now 16). I’ve watched these kids grow up, I’ve read the bedtime stories, done bath time, the first days of school, pta meetings, all of it. I very much consider them to be my kids, and they’ve been calling me mom for almost 6 years now.

My brother Ivan (28m) just had a baby girl with his fiancé Sara (27f). I love my niece, and my kids adore their cousin. My kids have been the only grandchildren on my side of the family since Ava and I got together, and there’s never been a moment where the kids and my wife were treated like they didn’t belong.
My brother is their uncle, my mom and dad are their nana and pop— the kids see my family as their family and I always thought that my family felt the same way about them.

The kids and I were over at my brother's house just hanging out, and my parents ended up dropping by with gifts for my niece.
Ivan laughed when he saw the toys and told our mom and dad that they were going to end up spoiling her rotten. My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her.

My kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said. My son and my 12yo didn’t fully react to it, but I could tell it bothered the both of them too.

Sara spoke up and said “oh you mean first grandbaby, not first grandchild.”

My dad shook his head and replied that my niece was their first grandchild. I didn’t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they’d say that my kids weren’t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn’t be their grandchildren because they weren’t really my children.

My wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn’t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their “real” family while I spent the holiday with mine.

I left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA.

My brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from. My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren’t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn’t want this to ruin my niece’s first thanksgiving.

I haven’t replied back. I meant what I said, but I’m worried that maybe I’m reacting too harshly.

ETA INFO:

I adopted all three of the kids about 4 years ago, so they aren't just my parents ""step grandchildren"". Even if I hadn't legally adopted them, they'd still be my kids in my eyes.

Edit no.2:

- My wife's parents don't have a relationship with the kids. When my wife came out, they pretty much stopped speaking with her entirely.
- Their bio dad is not involved and neither is his family. He lost his rights to the children before Ava and I started dating. The 10yo has never met him, the 12yo doesn't remember him, and the 16yo wants nothing to do with him.
- My parents wanted the kids to call them Nana and Pop. I didn't make the kids start calling them that.",31651,ysezdy,"Damn, Sara even gave them an out with the “oh you mean grand baby” comment, which is a slip of tongue I can see people saying unintentionally, but they doubled down twice!

AITA for making my SIL pay above average rent for one bedroom?,"I am 100% being petty here but curious if I am actually wrong. Most of my husbands family think I am being childish and ""need to let the past go"", as my SIL can't afford this but her behavior toward us in the past makes me feel this is warranted.

2 years ago my house burnt to the ground after being struck by lightening. Thankfully it was during the day so our 3 kids were at school and my husband and I were at work. We lost everything but we were safe. It took almost 11 months for the insurance to pay out. The insurance covered 1 month worth of hotel stays but after that we were made to fend for ourselves and the only option we had was to move in with my SIL. She tells us we can have her spare room and her office space, since she used neither of the rooms and her stipulations was we needed to purchase all of our own food and pay her $100 a week. By week 3 all of that changed. She then decides we need to pay her $250 a week and we can only use one room. So all 5 of us were crammed in to the smallest room she had, which was the size of a glorified closet space and didn't even fit a twin bed and a small dresser (so we lived out of trash bags and slept on the floor) for close to $1000 a month some months and still had to purchase all of our own food, despite her claiming my children on her foodstamps. She also had no bills outside of her land tax ($450 a year), electric and heating oil (which she hardly ever filled). So we were essentially paying her so she could do leisure activities. It was the worst 8 months of my life. 

3 months ago my grandmother decided that she wanted to go to assisted living after a fall and transferred the deed of her house to me and basically said it was mine now. It is a 5 bedroom farmhouse. My boys insist on sharing a room so we have 2 extra bedrooms. Well, my SIL lost her house last month due to not paying her land tax for several years and asked if her and her step daughter could stay with us until they get enough money to move down south. I said sure, 1 bedroom, $800 a month and you have to buy and cook all your food separately because my daughter is vegan. She looked at me like I had 10 heads and said that she and her step daughter should not be made to share a room when there are 2 extra rooms and stated she cannot afford a rent of $800 while purchasing all of her own food on top of it. I said ""neither could we but we managed to cram 5 people in to a glorified closet space while you were getting $1000 and foodstamps. Take it or leave it."" She decided to leave.

AITA for not treating my wife like an equal parent by telling her she has no say in the way I bond with my son and also calling her homophobic?,"  

When I (37M) was 17 got my then-girlfriend (16) pregnant with twin boys, her parents didn’t want the babies to “ruin” her future so they said that I had to either take them or give them up for adoption because she was not raising them. I wanted to give them up but my parents told me not to. 

For the first seven years of my boys’ lives, I didn’t act like a father and was more like a big brother (They knew I was their father though, but we never bonded like father-sons) 

When I was ready to move out, I wanted to do it without them but my dad let me know it was my responsibility so I had to take them (I didn’t want it at first but I’m glad it happened) We started bonding as father-sons, I started loving them and their love for me increased I remember the three of us would seat on the couch to watch movies, one would sit on my left and one on my right while I wrapped my arms around them, they’d put their heads on my chest and I often kissed their forehead. We’ve been doing this since they were seven.

I met my current wife, 5 years ago, (my kids were 15) we married 3 years ago after we welcomed our daughter (4F), she saw me doing this with my kids when we watched movies and she never said anything. 

My kids are no longer living with us because they left for college, but they come to see me every now and then. My boys are 20 now but they still like to put their heads on my chest while I wrap my arms around them, they do it every time they visit and I’m watching TV.

My son, Liam visited me 2 weeks ago, he came out to me as gay and introduced me to his bf. I don’t care how my kids live their sexuality or who they love, I love them no matter what, I just want them to be happy and I don’t feel any different, and it doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable to hug him or kiss his forehead, but it seems that my wife is a little uncomfortable. 

My son visited me again last Wednesday (Since he was here 2 weeks ago, so the first time “officially out”) I was watching “Red” with my daughter (she was on my left) then my son Liam arrived, he was tired and sat on my right, put his head on my shoulder while I wrap my arm around him, then I kissed his forehead and said, “Good to have you back buddy”. 

We went to sleep and the next day my wife told me that It made her feel uncomfortable (me hugging and kissing my son) and asked me not to do it again while she doesn’t mind me doing it with Lucas (my other son, straight) she doesn’t want me to do it with Liam. I told her that she has no business being in my relationship with my sons, I also called her homophobic. She accused me of not treating her like an equal parent, (to my sons) thus I said ""that's  ok because you are not"" 

My brother says I should understand because this is a big “change” for her (a son coming out) but seriously think there is nothing to get “used to” this isn’t neither her nor my problem who my son loves.

We’ve always fought over everything; guys, clothes, friends, etc. but our relationship came to a halt a few weeks ago when a mutual guy friend of ours sent me a link to an onlyfans profile, with an attached message that stated “this u?” 

Confused, I clicked on the link and was shocked to discover that the profile belonged to my twin sister. The profile picture was very clearly a scantily clad image of her, and the username was my nickname that literally everyone in my life uses. I asked our friend about it and he told me that he had discovered the profile through twitter and then subscribed to the profile, which included dozens of videos of her doing… spicy things to say the least, solo and with partners, all of which with her face showing.

I was floored and, in a fit of rage, showed the profile to our parents. I mean… literally anyone who saw that profile that knows us would immediately assume that it’s me considering she’s basically going by my name. Our parents forced her to delete the profile and she hasn’t spoken to me since, claiming that I not only ruined her main source of income, but also betrayed her trust.

"AITA for calling my hot-tempered guy coworker ""emotional"" to embarrass him into calming tf down?","So I'm an engineer and I'm working on a team with 7 decently chill guys and one guy with anger issues. Like he can't just have a respectful disagreement, he'll raise his voice and yell and get up close to your face. I hate it.

So I started by just complaining to my boss about it. And he brushed it under the rug saying he is just like that. And if I thought he was bad now I should of seen him 10 years ago before he ""mellowed out"" 

It makes me wonder what he was like 10 years ago because he sure ain't mellow now. 

It's also a small enough company that there's no HR, only the corporate management. Which didn't help. 

So I took a different approach. I stopped calling him ""angry"", or calling what he was doing ""arguing"" or ""yelling"". I just swapped in the words ""emotional"" or ""throwing a tantrum"" or ""having a fit""

I was kinda hoping if I could shift his reputation from domineering (big man vibes) to emotional and tantrumming (weak sad baby vibes) 

So I started just making subtle comments. Like if I had a meeting with him and he got a temper, I'd mention to the other people ""Wow, it's crazy how emotional Jay got. I dunno how he has the energy to throw a hissy fit at 9 am, I'm barely awake"" 

Or when my boss asked me to recap a meeting he missed, I told him ""Dan, Jack, and James had some really great feedback on my report for (this client). Jay kinda had trouble managing his emotions and had a temper tantrum again, but you know how he gets."" 

Or when a coworker asked why he was yelling I'd say ""Honestly I don't even know, he was getting so emotional about it he wasn't speaking rationally."" 

I tried to drop it in subtly and some of my coworkers started picking it up. I don't think consciously, just saying stuff like ""Oh, another of Jay's fits"" or something.

I got gutsy enough to even start saying to his face ""Hey, I can hardly understand what you're trying to explain when you're so emotional""

And again my coworkers started picking up on it and I even caught several of them telling him to get a hold of himself.

After a while, he started to get a reputation as emotional and irrational. Which I could tell pissed him off. But he stopped yelling at me as much. 

Anyway, he slipped once this week and I just said ""I really can't talk to you when you're being this emotional"" and he blew up at me asking why I was always calling him that. I shrugged and said ""dude you look like you're on the verge of tears, go look in the mirror before you ask me"" and he got really angry I suggested he might start crying. (That was a kinda flippant comment, he was red faced angry not tearful angry, and I could tell.) 

I feel like a bit of a dick for being petty and trying to gaslight this guy into thinking everyone around him sees him like a crybaby. But it also mostly worked when the ""proper channels"" didn't

AITA for favoring my scapegoat brother over his golden child twin sister?,"I (20m) has two younger siblings, ""Joe"" and ""Jill"". They're twins, both 18 and graduating high school this year. Jill is my parent's favorite, because they've always wanted a daughter, while Joe is their scapegoat, because I guess he's the bonus baby they never actually asked for. I'm mostly better off than Joe, as I'm the oldest grandson from both sides of my family, almost all of whom are just as blantant as my parents are about their favoritism.

I felt really bad for Joe, so I did what I could to make him feel less alone. Like when Jill got to go shopping with mommy and daddy, I took Joe skating with my friends. When our parents were too busy watching Jill's kiddie pageant, I dragged my best bud to sit through Joe's elementary school musical. Small things like that. It all started as pity moves, but soon my friends pretty much like Joe better than me, while Jill's princess syndrome got in her head, so now I spend more time with Joe because I simply like him better than Jill. Never said it out loud, but I don't make it a secret either that I prefer not to spend my time with entitled brats.

Anyway, like I said they're graduating soon. They both already had their choice of college, accomodations, etc. Jill's going to a uni in SF, fully funded by our parents, unsurprisingly. Joe's going to the same Uni as mine in Seattle, but different campus just 20ish minutes away. He got a full ride, which apparently makes him ineligible to get any financial help from his own parents. This is also hardly surprising, so I made some calls to ask around, see if anyone is hiring next fall. I did this while on facetime with Joe. I was reassuring him that we'll find him a job that don't suck and pays enough, that he's better off without dad's money anyway because we both know it comes with strings attached, that this way, mom and dad wouldn't be able to stick their noses into his purchases. I got him to feel better about the whole thing and logged off.

I guess Jill overheard, because the next day she sent me texts after texts demanding I help her find jobs as well because she doesn't want dad ""nagging her"". When I told her, politely btw, that I don't know anyone in SF, and that she'd get more help from mom and dad, she blew up, saying all these things about me favoring Joe over her, which, yeah. It's true. I love both of my siblings, but I don't particularly like Jill. It's not like she's making herself likeable, though, so AITA?",30997,tm2oh0,"NTA.

Your brother is very lucky to have you.

But remember that it is not your sister's fault, that her parents favoured her. It is also not her fault, that this made her entitled.

But she is an adult now, so it is her responsibility to do better in the future. She will need time for that. I would directly explain to her, why you treat them differently. Get it out in the open, it seems about time. Be kind and tell her, that you love her and don't blame her for your parents mistakes but also point out specific situations, where her behaviour made hanging out with her difficult.

It is also not your job to help your siblings. You are doing it for your brother, because you want to. You have good reasons to not want to do it for Jill as well. She did not even ask nicely, she just demanded it.

AITA for pretending not to recognize my parents when they tried to reconnect?,"I was raised mostly by my uncle and aunt.  My older sister developed a serious illness when I was 6 and my parents decided that they couldn’t care for both of us I guess, so they kind of unceremoniously dumped me at my grandparents and my uncle took me in. Like, didn’t even explain to me what was going on, just “you’re going to go visit gran for awhile” and never picked me back up.  My grandparents and uncle explained it later, and they were pretty livid at my parents. I’ve seen my parents maybe 5 times since then and not at all for the last 9 years.  I decided to stop having contact with them when I was 12 and since I was the only one reaching out all communication broke down.  It turned out ok, I love my aunt and uncle and it turns out they can’t have kids so they’ve always said I’m their miracle kid, I was just misrouted by the stork at first. I was formally adopted by them when I turned 18, I wish it had been earlier but there were some red tape things that would have made that really expensive and difficult. I’m 21 now.

My sister passed away between thanksgiving and Christmas and I made a trip back from school for the funeral, but I stayed in the back and left before my bio parents could talk to me.  They called my uncle to try to talk to me, but I said I didn’t want to so he told them that I wasn’t available at the moment.

They finally caught up to me over Christmas when I went to midnight mass with my gran, and approached me and tried to give me a hug.  I did recognize them, but I pretended not to and just backed off and said “Sorry, do I know you?” They said “We’re your parents!” and I said “My parents are at home.” and went and sat down with my gran. They sat behind us and I could just feel the stare, and on the way out they were like “You really don’t recognize us?” And I said “Oh, are you my dad’s brother? I think I remember you from when I was little.”

My gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened, but they wrote me a long letter about how hurt they are and how I should understand that they were trying to do the right thing and how they’ll always be my parents and I can’t change that. Other family members think I was too harsh as they’re grieving, but I don’t think they should get a pass just because they remembered me now that my sister is gone.",31057,109jid0,"Notice how in their letter, they only focused on themselves.

AITA for telling my inlaws about what their son's girlfriend did to my son's blanket and causing her to get shunned?,"

I F,33 found out that my ex husband M, 37 was cheating on me when I was 7 months pregnant with our son. I got a divorce and we share custody of our 3 yro old son. My ex husband's girlfriend tried to get involved in my parenting several times, she even commented on my son's name implying that we should agree on a name we all want not just what I wanted, and tried to dictate what he should and shouldn't have. As a result she started throwing stuff of his that I paid for myself. Honestly it's frustrating because I'm barely getting by with the money I have and can not afford to buy replacement for all the stuff she throws put but my ex husband says it's her ""house"" and she gets to decide what can and can't enter.


I made a crochet blanket for my son with his name on it. This blanket is special to me, and the tools I used to be able to make it cost me money. Not to mention the time and effort it took to get it down.


I sent my son to stay with his dad days ago, and he wanted to take the blanket with him to sleep with it. I don't know exactly what happened, but when I came to pick him up he told me his dad's girlfriend took it away from him and threw it out leaving him with no blanket to sleep with at night as ""punishment"" for him for not accepting the one she offered. I was furious. I called his dad but he hung up on me, I sent him a text explaining the situation, but he texted back telling me that I should stop the drama and go look for a job if I have so much free time on my hand instead of picking on his girlfriend. I felt frustrated I visited his family who are good to me and told them about what their son's girlfriend did, now it's worth mentioning that she's been working hard for their approval and to get on their good side. They were shocked to know about what she did they all flipped out on her and started calling her out. My SIL took it further by putting this on social media which made other family members see what she did.

My ex husband called me yelling about my ""pathetic attempt"" to turn his family against his girlfriend. I could hear her freaking out in the background while he was lashing out at me saying I ruined every chance she had to have a good relationship with her ""future inlaws"". I hung up and felt absolutely horrible, even though I was just venting to his family about what happened and felt frustrated. Maybe I shouldn't have told them? I'm not sure anymore since the whole family aren't speaking to her si that might have epa lasting impact on their relationship with her.",30888,w6u5j7,NTA this lady is abusing your child.

AITA for leaving a fake postive pregnancy test in the bedroom to catch my husband's mom snooping?,"My MIL moved in with us a month ago. I began to notice my stuff in the bedroom being touched. Furniture rearranged, stuff moved et cetera...


I felt like I was going crazy because my husband is the only one who has access to the bedroom and he doesn't usually touch nor come near my things. I figured it must be his mom walking in and snooping on my personal things. I told my husband and he said his mom would never...I had a huge hunch but couldn't instal a cam in the bedroom to catch her in act.


So, I got me one of those fake postive pregnancy tests and threw it in the bedroom's trashcan. note the trashcan was placed in the corner near the closet.



Literally the next day after I got to work, I got tons of calls and texts from my inlaws ""congratulating"" me for my ""pregnancy"". My husband came over to my workplace and was all worked up about it asking since when I was pregnant, and why I didn't tell him. I asked how he found out and he said his mom found the positive test in the trashcan in the bedroom. I asked if his answer just confirmed that she's been snooping in the bedroom all along. He had a ""realization"" moment but demanded we stick to the bigger issue, I said there was no bigger issue because the positive test was fake and this whole thing was done to expose my MIL's snooping. he was not convinced. he had me take an actual test right infront of him and he was livid asking how could I lie about such thing and break his mom's heart since I know...very well that she longs for kids. I got a lot of shit because of this from him, his mom and family now calling me a liar and manipulator.

AITA for staying true to my threats after my dad died?,"
My dad died unexpectedly last week and my sister Jess and I lost our mom last year to a mix of cancer and the virus. 
From how our family acted in the past over scavenging over dead people’s things both Jess and I decided to send out a family memo on no one is to enter or take anything from our parents house until we get there. Both Jess and I work on the west coast so it takes some time to get there with all of our kids and family. 

I saw several notifications from my parents Ring Doorbell and I’m a lawyer. I reminded my family we will prosecute. Jess and I are on the same page. 
Jess gets to my parents house first and notices stuff is missing and my parents had security cameras and an Alexa show. It shown my cousin taking stuff from the house. So Jess did what we agreed on and called the police and two of our cousins was arrested. Because it was over a thousand dollars both are looking at felonies. My cousin said my dad promised him this stuff and I have my dad’s will making me executor of the estate. I told him he should have waited to file a claim with estate and everyone was warned about what would happen. 
Jess and I don’t have the best relationship with our extended family and We are not dropping charges. Because of this drama dad was quietly cremated with no service and we plan to hold one when scattered our parents ashes at Jess’s house in a tree planted for them. 
My last living grandma is upset about it but she sided with my cousins and aunt saying we are too tough on having them arrested.",30811,xuu5zc,"NTA

Your dad created a will and made you the executor of the estate for a reason. If your cousin's were actually meant to have the thousands of dollars worth of items they took, they could've waited until you arrived. 

It sucks that they got arrested but the first thing on their minds when losing a relative shouldn't be ""I should take items from their house"" or ""I'm owed these items let me go collect."" 

Plus you and your sister gave advanced warning, so it's not like you just randomly decided to call the police.",2971,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xuu5zc/aita_for_staying_true_to_my_threats_after_my_dad/,"['dad', 'died', 'unexpectedly', 'last', 'week', 'sister', 'jess', 'lost', 'mom', 'last', 'year', 'mix', 'cancer', 'virus', 'family', 'acted', 'past', 'scavenging', 'dead', 'peoples', 'things', 'jess', 'decided', 'send', 'family', 'memo', 'one', 'enter', 'take', 'anything', 'parents', 'house', 'get', 'jess', 'work', 'west', 'coast', 'takes', 'time', 'get', 'kids', 'family', 'saw', 'several', 'notifications', 'parents', 'ring', 'doorbell', 'im', 'lawyer', 'reminded', 'family', 'prosecute', 'jess', 'page', 'jess', 'gets', 'parents', 'house', 'first', 'notices', 'stuff', 'missing', 'parents', 'security', 'cameras', 'alexa', 'show', 'shown', 'cousin', 'taking', 'stuff', 'house', 'jess', 'agreed', 'called', 'police', 'two', 'cousins', 'was', 'arrested', 'because', 'was', 'thousand', 'dollars', 'looking', 'felonies', 'cousin', 'said', 'dad', 'promised', 'this', 'stuff', 'dads', 'making', 'executor', 'estate', 'told', 'waited', 'file', 'claim', 'estate', 'everyone', 'was', 'warned', 'would', 'happen', 'jess', 'best', 'relationship', 'extended', 'family', 'dropping', 'charges', 'because', 'this', 'drama', 'dad', 'was', 'quietly', 'cremated', 'service', 'plan', 'hold', 'one', 'scattered', 'parents', 'ashes', 'jesss', 'house', 'tree', 'planted', 'last', 'living', 'grandma', 'upset', 'sided', 'cousins', 'aunt', 'saying', 'tough', 'having', 'arrested']",dad died unexpectedly last week sister jess lost mom last year mix cancer virus family acted past scavenging dead peoples things jess decided send family memo one enter take anything parents house get jess work west coast takes time get kids family saw several notifications parents ring doorbell im lawyer reminded family prosecute jess page jess gets parents house first notices stuff missing parents security cameras alexa show shown cousin taking stuff house jess agreed called police two cousins was arrested because was thousand dollars looking felonies cousin said dad promised this stuff dads making executor estate told waited file claim estate everyone was warned would happen jess best relationship extended family dropping charges because this drama dad was quietly cremated service plan hold one scattered parents ashes jesss house tree planted last living grandma upset sided cousins aunt saying tough having arrested 
AITA For not being happy that my sister is pregnant AGAIN?,"Throwaway because I don't want my family tracking this back to my main.

My sister got knocked up by her boyfriend right out of highschool, got married the next year, then proceeded to pop out another baby every year or two, so she has four now at 24. She's a stay at home mom even though she was brilliant and could have gotten a free ride to a great University. Since hers are the only grandkids, our parents fawn over her like she's the next coming of Christ. They gush over over every new tooth or haircut like it's some huge achievement.

Problem is, her husband's business wasn't great even even before COVID, and is barely limping along now. Sister doesn't work, and my parents have limited income. So guess who's constantly being told to ""lend"" them money for shit like school fees, car seat, car payment, new  stroller, etc. They don't even ask! My mom just texts me ""your sister needs $X.XX for the kids"" and I'm supposed to cough up. If I complain, they accuse me of being  jealous because I don't have a husband and family even though I'm older (I'm only 26!)

So over Easter I notice my sister isn't drinking and I think oh god, here we go again. Sure enough, she stands up and announces that she's been inseminated with yet another precious miracle.  Everyone's gushing and I just try to stay quiet and out of the way. 

Later she asks me if everything's alright and I try to play it off but she pushes so I asked her if she and her husband could really afford another baby. She very snippily replies ""God will provide like he has so far,"" which really pissed me off. I yelled that no, actually god didn't provide for her babies, **I** did, and I wasn't going to giving them any more handouts. It devolved into a big argument with everyone shouting at me, and basically I've been banned from my family unless I apologize. I haven't apologized. 

It's been radio silence except for one text from my mom saying that if my sister miscarries it's my fault for stressing her out. I asked if my sister was showing any symptoms but no one will answer or tell me. IDK. I don't think I'm TA but I don't want to be the reason she miscarries. Also, I think I might be TA because secretly I think it would be better if she did even though I wouldn't say that to her.",30737,u84njt,"NTA. They did you a favor by cutting you off.

"AITA? I went on vacation with my friend and her family, and they kicked me out. I got my own room and stayed.","I am in college and my roommate from last year, Meg, who's family is really rich, said she could bring a friend on vacation. It was kinda awkward, I was her third choice but her family vetoed the first two because they didn't want her bringing a boy or this other female friend of hers they disliked.

Her parents bought my plane ticket and booked the resort which I was very grateful for and I saved a lot of money up so I could make sure I buy my own food and activities when I'm there, and treat her family to a dinner as a thank you for the ticket.

But when the trip started, it was just bad. It was her, me, her mother, her father, two of her father's friends, and her three brothers going. 

On the flight, they all got first class and got me a economy seat. But I didn't say anything because why argue about a free ticket?

The first night they went to a grocery, it turns out they wanted to cook at the resort kitchen for the whole trip 

And by ""they wanted to cook"" it actually turned out that they wanted me and Meg to cook. I wasn't warned about this but it turns out Meg's family is sooo ""traditional"" that they see cooking as a women's job. And her mom had just had hand surgery.

So it was me and Meg cooking every meal for six men and her mom. And I can't cook well. I know a couple staple meals to feed myself but since I rarely eat meat I don't know how to cook it. I'm also ok at cooking for 1 or 2 but have no practice cooking for a group of 9

I screwed it up, undercooked chicken, and overcooked some steak and her dad was angry with me. I got short with him and told him that if he knew how to do better he could pitch in instead of standing around criticizing.

But he got furious and said he was on his vacation. I said that I was trying to have a vacation too, or did they invite me to be an unpaid domestic servant? 

Meg's parents and dad's friends got angry I said that and started yelling at me.

The argument escalated, I sarcastically called myself ""the help""

His dad snapped at me and told me to get out of their suite and go home. Didn't say shit about how he expected me to do that.

I left and called the airline with my ticket, and asked them if they could do anything to prevent anyone else from modifying or cancelling my ticket. They let me set a passcode, and no changes could be made to the flight without it.  

Then I went to the resort desk to ask about rooms, saying I was stranded unexpectedly. They actually did have some affordable rooms available because of a weekday discount. So I got housing and still had money left over for touristy stuff. 

I went sightseeing and relaxed on the beach for three days, until Meg's parents ran into me. They were taking a sunset walk and did a double take seeing me on the beach. They said they thought I was going home, and I said I decided to stay.

AITA for refusing to help my step sister with her house purchase and telling her and my step father that it's because of how they treated me as a child?,"I'm 29F. When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11.

We didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money.

So my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. 

Anyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place.

I visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant. He asked me if I'm able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is £500k and she needs a £150k deposit. She has £100k so far. £25k on her own, £25k from her mum and £50k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra £50k and he said he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually.

I said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave £10k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he's offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back ""like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids?""

Everyone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he'd have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that's good of you but doesn't make you entitled to my money now. He said he knows he's not entitled, that's why he's asking and promising to pay it back, I said the answer still is no, not entitled to a loan either.

My mum later told me I could have turned him down without being an asshole or bringing up childhood which he already feels guilty about. AITA?",30557,yzqvu1,"NTA.  Step dad is though.

AITA for leaving my inlaws house with my daughter after she told me she was feeling uncomfortable?,"


I M37 have been with my fiancee F37 for 2 years. We're getting married soon, I've only met her family a couple of times. My daughter ""Judy"" F16 has never met them til very recently where they hosted dinner to celebrate 4th of july and that's when they met her for the first time.

Judy has a visible burnscar on her forehead. It was due to an accident she was in when she was 9. She used tk be incredibly insecure about it. To the point where I was forced to home school her and it was hard trying to deal with and navigate through this rough time. Now she's doing a lot better though some comments can really cause her to become stressed out and anxious. My fiancee knows all that and respects it. Before we went to her parents house I asked her to tell them about Judy and her struggle and get to try and not say anything negative about it or possibly mention it. She said she would guarentee no one will say anything.


We got to the event and they talked to Judy and she slowly warmed up to them. Everything was going well til I was dinner time. My FMIL looked at Judy while she was eating and pointed at her scar. Basically asking questions about it which made Judy lose her appetite and start to get uncomfortable. I kept sending my fiancee and her mom signs to knock it off but to no avail. Finally, FMIL then brought up the wedding and asked my fiancee if it'd be possible to ""photoshop"" the scar out of any wedding photos that will have Judy in them just in case they distract viewers. I was dumbfounded, fiancee said nothing just stared casually while nodding. I looked at Judy and it was clear this got to her. I leaned closer and asked if she was feeling uncomfortable and that we could leave if the answer was yes. She took her time then nodded and said ""yes, I'm feeling uncomfortable right now"".I got up and told her to get ready cause we were leaving. My fiancee, her mom and the family started insisting we finish dinner and stay but I refused. I took Judy and got in the car and left before even talking to my fiance.

Obviously, she was pissed. She called an was angry talking about how I disrespected her parents by taking Judy and leaving in the middle of dinnerand not even ""saying goodbye"", i told her that Judy was feeling uncomfortable with FMILs comments and questions. She said Judy overreacted and is in need to go back to therapy if a simply mention of her scar caused her to react that way. I got tired of arguing and asked her to give us some time but she went on me and said that I have no respect for her and her family and that what I did was irrational and now she won't speak to me til I clear things up with her family after ruining their celebratory dinner.",30480,vss2sc,"NTA.

AITA for not asking my MIL nicely to hand over the baby for feeding?,"

Hi. I'm a new mom, had my son 5 weeks ago. my husband's parents have been staying with us and things have been super overwhelming.


MIL has a habit of taking the baby and refusing to give him back to me. She'd say I'm deliberately ruining her time with him. My son needs feeding every 2hrs and she basically makes me beg her to hand him over to me so I could feed.

last night at 10PM. MIL had my son in her arms while sitting on the couch with my husband and his dad. I was exhausted, the baby started crying. I told my MIL to hand him over to me so I could feed him. She refused and I kept asking. my husband starts talking about what a whinny little girl I was to complain that our son is receiving love and cuddles and how I'm using feeding as an excuse to keep the baby away from his mom. I ignored him and told his mom to hand over the baby. she refused and said I needed to wait a little longer.

I got angry at this point, My husband said I could take the baby after I ask his mom nicely. This had me seething I meanly told his mom to stop being annoying and overbearing and hand him over to me. She looked at me shocked and hurt. She handed the baby over and ran into the guest room and my husband gave me a look than followed her and stayed inside to comfort her.


He came into the room while I was feeding my son and started yelling about how disrespectful I was to speak to his mom this way and treat her poorly when all she's doing is showing our son more love than I do. I told him about how she's been taking the baby for hours and preventing me from feeding him properly. he said that 1, our son isn't an object for me to act like I own him and 2, his mom was doing nothing wrong and 3, I should've asked nicely instead of being a bi$ch to his mom and making her cry. I started crying and yelled that I'd go to my mom's place if his parents stay any longer and he yelled back saying ""shut the fuck up, you're only acting up cause you don't want my parents around! fuck's wrong with you?"" then walked out. I felt terrible thinking maybe I was rude to his mom but I also think that I'd hit my limits here.

AITA for having my kids wear tie dye when with their dad?,"I (30 F) my ex-husband (31m). Got divorced 5 yrs ago. During our divorce we owned a old single wide mobile home (1973). On a large piece of land that is zoned for a trailer park. 
He wanted the new truck and our savings. I wanted the old trailer and the land.

My ex and I have 2 girls (8&7).
Since my divorce. I slowly started buying old single wides and restoring them. Turning it into a business. I love it. 

My girls go to their dads and AP apartment  every other weekend. I started noticing their clothes, electronics, toys were not coming home. At first I thought their dad was just keeping a few outfits there for them. However, my 8 yr. old got upset when she was packing. I asked her what was wrong. She told me her dad takes her clothes and sells them on line. That she doesn’t want to take her favorite shirt over there.

I immediately called my ex. I asked him to return our daughters clothes. Not wanting to throw my daughter under the bus. I blamed it on them not having enough for school. He played dumb. He said he got rid of the clothes that were too small. I pointed out that the jeans our (7 yr.) had were brand new. He then said that it was only fair he got some cash because he owned the trailer and land. If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be doing this good.

I was pissed. I took my daughters down to the dollar store and bought cheap shirts.
To a thrift store and bought cheap shorts.
We had a “girls” tie dye night. Hot pink every thing. Each made 5 shirts and 5 bottoms. I let our girls design and decorate them. My girls loved it. 

The following week Ex sends the girls home. I could tell he is mad but, he didn’t say anything. The clothes were not returned. No fear I knew this would be a issue. We made extras. When the girls went back they were wearing tie dye.

They were with their dad for a hour before he called and demanded different clothes. I kindly told him that our daughters love those clothes (they really really love tie dye). Ex get even angrier and said his parents have a major family party and the girls can’t wear pink tie dye. I told him that he should go buy other clothes if he didn’t want them to wear it. 
He called me an A for being petty.
AITA?
Edited to add. 
Thank you so much for all the comments. Here are some things to clarify.
1) AP stands for Affair partner 
2) owned is past tense. My ex is not on the land deed or the title to my trailer.

AITA for dropping my freeloading brother off at our aunt's house after she called and scolded me for evicting him?,"My older brother (OB) is... a bit of a bum. It's mean to say but it's true. He can never hang onto a job for longer than a couple years max and when he inevitably loses whatever job he had he starts mooching off family and friends until he can find another job months later. This entails him freeloading at their place, eating their food, using their stuff, etc. He's lost friends because of how long he bummed off of them and I don't blame them for cutting him off.

Well this last time he lost his job he went to our parents but they didn't have room because they were letting our eldest brother's (EB) family stay with them after he and SIL lost their jobs out of nowhere within the same month (EB's entire crew was laid off with zero warning and SIL's work burned down) and they couldn't afford the home they were renting anymore. So OB was pretty much SOL. So our parents, aunt, and uncle all started calling me asking if I'd take him in just long enough so he could get on his feet again.

I (stupidly) let myself feel bad for him and said okay, but he only had a few months to get another job or he was out on the street. They all said of course, of course and so he came to stay with me. And it was a nightmare. He's a slob. He NEVER washes dishes, never washes his clothes, and eats pretty much whatever he wants. I guess since I'm his little sister he figured he could ignore me saying to get his shit together. Well after 6 months I told him he had to go. And gave him a couple weeks to find somewhere else.

Well it seems he called our parents and cried about me kicking him out and they told him he knew he couldn't stay forever but they also ofc called my aunts/uncle and told them all about it. And my busybody aunt called me and scolded me for ""being cruel to my brother"" and ""abandoning family when they need help"". I let her talk and finally said she was right, helping family was important and I'm glad she showed me that. She seemed glad I ""understood the right thing to do"" before hanging up. So I followed her advice and packed my bro up and drove him to her house. I couldn't take care of him anymore (he was running all my bills up) but my aunt made a good point, family should help each other.

So I dropped him off there (she has room since all her kids moved out) and then left. But I wasn't even halfway home before I was getting multiple calls from my parents and aunt. Parents were demanding to know why our aunt was blowing up their phones and aunt was leaving voicemails shouting at me to come back and get my brother. I explained to my parents and they said it was a good idea since aunt sounded like she wanted to help but my aunt called me an asshole and said she didn't want my brother there. And when I told her family helps each other she called me a cunt. Last I checked he's still living with her. AITA?

\-

Sorry for my lack of replies! I answered what ones I could before I left for work and when I got back I had far too many to answer.

Lots of people have been asking similar questions so I thought answering them here once would be helpful.

1. My brother doesn't work menial jobs, he's not just hopping from one minimum wage job to another. He's working Very Good paying jobs. Like electronic repair, automotive maintenance, etc. He's very skilled but lazy.
2. No my aunt hasn't spoken to me since she called me a cunt then hung up on me.
3. My brother has only been with her about 3-ish weeks. He stayed with me for 6-7 months.
4. My brother was upset I was kicking him out initially but in a better mood when he realized I had another place lined up for him to stay. Not sure how they're doing together since I haven't talked to either since after I dropped him off.
5. No my aunt isn't married anymore, her and my uncle got divorced and he lives with his new wife (but I heard from dad that he thought this all was hilarious).

\- Edit 2 -

To everyone who has been hounding me through PM and in the comments, my brother isn't (last time we checked) neurodivergent nor does he have ADD or ADHD. Our mom took him to the doctor more than once around when he was 15-17 when his behavior was at its worst. 

According to our mom the doctors all said he was perfectly healthy and fine, though they (the doctors) suggested he wasn't being mentally stimulated enough (aka he was bored?). Mom wanted to take him to see other doctors but by then he'd turned 18 and refused to go and she couldn't force him.

Also its been suggested he maybe see a doctor now but my OB doesn't seem at all interested. He's never had the highest respect for doctors or mental illness. He treats it like it's fake. When our baby sister was diagnosed with an ED when she was 19 he just cracked a joke about her just wanting a doctor's note so she could eat more...",30245,sgpy7n,NTA. I like your style.

AITA for going home after I got told to sleep on the floor?,"

I'll preface this by saying that my husband (33) has a friend ""Carl"" (33) who he considers to be one of his closest friends. My husband sometimes calls Carl his ""nicotine"" because of how much he misses him and wants to spend time with him, they do everything together, they're even co workers working the same job.


Unfortunately, Carlos's wife passed away from cancer 3 months ago which caused him to distance himself. My husband felt devastated for him, he recently started spending more time with him and brought him meals and new clothes. 

We planned a 3 day vacation to another state. I made a hotel reservation for 2. Unbeknownst to me, my husband had invited Carl to come with us, this made me upset because it spolied the entire vacation (not trying to be dramatic) I only found out when he went to pick him up. I sucked it up after my husband explained that Carl is a recent widower who's been wallowing in grief for so long and needed this vacation. The problem is money is tight and since Carl hasn't worked eversince his wife passed he couldn't pay for his own room and we didn't have a budget for it.

My husband said we should just share one room and I again sucked it since he said we'd be out all day on the beach anyway. First night, I was in bed when my husband and Carl got back, I got woken up by my husband telling me to get out of bed and sleep on thd mattress he put for me on the floor and he and Carl would take the bed. I asked if he was serious and he asked what else is he supposed to do, he said Carl was a guest we can't let him sleep on the floor and at the same time I can't share a bed with Carl while he (my husband) sleep on the floor. I told him I didn't sign up for this but he told me to suck it and tried to pull ""Carl is a widower"" card. I told Carl to get out then got up and got dressed to go home. My husband started yelling me calling me irrational but I wasn't having it. I left the hotel and traveled back home. Carl didn't say anything when he saw me leave except that I was making this non-issue an issue.

They got back and my husband refused to even talk about but still said I ruined this for Carl and us and acted abhorrently and disgustingly. I admit Carl is struggling and I mightve ruined this for him but I didn't even know he was coming.",30139,uuo7wb,NTA. Your husband has a better relationship with Carl than he does with you.

AITA for throwing my sister and her son out of my house?,"I (35M) am a single father of 3 boys (10M, 7M and 3M). Their mother died last year due to ovarian cancer. It has been a rough year to say the least. My sister got divorced 6 months ago and temporarily moved in with me and the boys. She has a son, my nephew (9M) who stays with us most of the time. My nephew and my 10yro are not the best of friends, but so far they got along fine apart from some teasing from both sides. 
A few weeks ago my 10yro started telling me that his cousin was bullying him and being mean to him. He called him names, pushed him around, took his video games etc. I talked to my sister many times and told her to talk to her son, we talked to the boys together and things settled down. 
Yesterday was my 3yro's birthday, so my whole family was here and my late wife's family as well. It was extremely emotional for everyone, because it was the first birthday since my wife's been gone. The boys (10yro and 9yro) started fighting again and I asked them both to calm down and behave. My son started crying and told me his cousin teased him about him not having a mom. I choked up and asked my nephew if that was true, and he said yes, but that he's sorry. I figured I'd have a proper talk with him and my sister after the party, so I just told him what he said was really awful and he cannot say it again. I comforted my son and we went back to the party. 
Before we cut the cake, my sister came yelling at me, saying I had no bussineaa disciplining her child. I told her to drop it and we'll talk later, instead she said ""besides, he's right, kids need a mom"". I had tears in my eyes by that time and she just said ""see, it's even turning you into a pu**y"". 
My in-laws were crying, I was tearing up, the kids were upset, just awful. I told her to stop it and just leave me and the kids and the family to cut the cake and we will talk in the evening. She said ""listen we both lost our spouses, but at least I'm still a normal person"". She stormed off. After the party I told her she has 2 days to pack her shit and leave. 
She is begging me not to throw her out, because she and her kid will be homeless. 
Aita for throwing her out?

UPDATE: my mom agreed to take my sister in temporarily, and my nephew is still going to his dad's because now his dad is saying that there's no way he's letting my sister ruin their kid. 
I want to thank you all for your kind words and all the love and support. Also, to everyone who also shared about losing a loved one, I am so so sorry for your loss. 
My nephew is supposed to leave tomorrow morning, my mom is picking my sister up right around that time, and my inlaws are bringing my boys back in the evening.

"AITA For Making A ""Pregnancy Jar""?","
My husband and I have been married for 6 years. Still don't have kids (we want them but it still not happening). Friends and family are causing us constant stress about having a baby soon but it's obviously something we can't control. We only wished that they'd stop but to no avail.

So what I did was come up with idea (stupid I know) and that is have an empty jar and call it ""Pregnancy Jar"". I carry it with me in my bag whenever I'm with friends and family and everytime someone asks about when my husband and I are gonna have a baby, I pull my Jar out and ask them to drop a dollar in there for asking. I'd get puzzled looks but they reach out for their pockets/wallets/purses and pull out a dollar and out it inside the jar. It actually worked because most of thrm stopped asking after 4 months.


Last week we had dinner at my parents house, My brother came back from his business trip that lasted a month and while we were eating he asked when me and my husband were going to have a kid. My husband paused, I got up from the chair and made my way to where my brother was sitting with my jar in my hand and asked him to drop a dollar for the question he asked, he stared at me then laughed nervously asking if I was being serious.  Everyone was looking at us. He said no, he didn't have to pay me but I told him he didn't have to ask either so here we are!. I could tell he felt embarrassed he immediately reached out to his pocket, pulled out his wallet and put a dollar in my jar. I made my way back to my seat and sat down and resumed eating like nothing happened. It got awkward afterward. Mom pulled me into the kitchen later to tell me that I embarrassed my brother infront of his wife and family and said I should quit acting childish by running around with a jar demanding others to put money in it, I told her they should quit asking then. She went on about how they're just worried for us since we are in mid 30s and don't have much time left if we want at least one healthy baby. I got upset and she started arguing. My husband and I left and we haven't seen them in days, except I got a call from my sister basically siding with mom and the others saying I'm being childish.


So AITA for this?



[Edit - Q&As... ]

(1) this has been going on for years but in the past year it has gotten worse. 

(2) I already told them about how I feel regarding this question, my husband doesn't care much and says I should let it go too.

(3) Yes they pay everytime because it's just a dollar, it won't make me any richer or them any poorer.

(4) My husband and I spend the money on snacks to eat every night when watching tv or some toys for the dogs.


One more thing... I realize that this could actually be expanded into wedding jar/Cake jar (for weight loss)/work jar/house jar/ and so no and so on. Depending on the the type of truggle because these are the things we struggle and get frustrated with often but.. with the fact that people will just keep asking then we might become millionaires one day. Lol.

Also, someone suggested I up the price to 5$. It will mostly depend on the prices of gas, lol, so we'll see.",30004,ufbbvv,"NTA

I make it awkward. 

""Oh dear. Maybe we are doing it right. What positions do you recommend that really *make it work?*""

"AITA for throwing away the elf on the shelf and ""ruining Christmas"" for my kids after my husband's prank?","For context, this year was the first time we would try the ""elf on the shelf"" with our kids. We have 3 kids, Lucas (9M), Andy (8M), and Claire (5F). Where Lucas and Andy are from our past relationships. However, Miles (my husband M37) has accepted Andy as his, and so did I (F35) with Lucas.

Every Christmas is special for Andy, his bd is on Dec/24.  His dad started a tradition where Santa would've consideration with him for being a ""kid of Christmas"". So he feels magical and special. I always try to give him that. Last year, i left ""Santa Claus"" footsteps, ate a carrot and ""grass"" he left for Rudolf. Stuff like that.

My husband doesn't think it's a good idea i do all that for him, and I'm showing favoritism. So, we should shut it down, because of my ex's decision to create a tradition without considering my other kid's feelings. I disagree since i do consider the 3 of them. But he asked if we could so smth else, like the Elf on the shelf. I had no problem with it, but I didn't know how that works. He explained me quickly, and since he was the one who offered, i let him do it.

We bought the cute Elf. My kids named it ""Bob"". Later my husband explained them they should behave, and never touch/hold Bob if they don't want it to be naughty. At first, it was cute to see them spy on Bob, try to see it ""fly"" each night. Andy was the most excited of all, i found him one night talking with it, asking it if Santa still remembered him.

But my husband took seriously the ""Behave or Bob would be naughty"" part. Lucas was his first victim after he didn't do his chores. The next day, his face was drawn with sharpie markers. Then Claire, who touched Bob and her fave onesie was destroyed. Apparently, Bob had cut some pieces of it, while she was sleeping. Miles was having fun, but i could see my kids weren't. I talked to him about how we should lower the pranks, he agreed but wanted to catch Andy since he hadn't break any rules. I told him that Bob's supposed to tell Santa instead of being naughty. We argued but he finally agreed.

Fast forward, it's Christmas Eve and in the afternoon we had some of Andy's friends to celebrate his bd. So the kids were playing in backyard. But my husband looked sus. I decided to look for Bob. It was supposed to be in the kitchen but it wasn't there, I asked Miles where it was and he told me ""no idea"". I started getting paranoid, but Andy asked me if we could cut the cake already. I put my best face on and went for it. The cake was in a box, and when Andy opened the box. He starts crying. I take a look and it's ruined. ""Bob"" was covered in all of it, appearing he had been eating the cake. Half of the cake wasn't there anymore. Miles starts laughing and so did some of the other parents.

My blood is boiling and i grab Bob and throw it in the trash, Then i grabbed Miles. We have a terrible argument, calls me an AH for what i did to Bob, that I've ruined it, how are we supposed to keep the ""magic"" with our kids if i wasn't supposed to touch Bob.

Edit: Hi everyone, so the response has been really overwhelming. I'm sorry if it took me some time to answer i was kinda avoiding the post, since i was conflicted by the possible outcome. I'm going through all your comments, so i can answer some of your questions. I'd also explain things you all have doubts in common.

1.-Andy's dad is from Canada, he visit's Andy every spring, summer and on Christmas break. This year he stayed for his job, so he isn't an absent parent.

2.-After Andy's bd i told Miles to get out of the house, and so he did, he spent Christmas with my in laws. I stayed with the kids, and all of them slept in Andy's room. My kids didn't want to leave his brother alone. The next morning we opened the gifts and i made sure that Andy could feel special after what happened on his bd, so i wrote a note from ""Bob"". Saying that he is sorry if scared him and his siblings, he didn't do his job correctly so now he would be flying to the NP with Santa. And when he asked if Santa still remembered the kid of Xmas, he did. Santa was really happy to see him.

3.-My kids and i, are ok, we are sleeping at my parent's house. And we would celebrate NYE here too.

4.-Yes, Claire was usign the onesie while she was sleeping. My husband took the idea out of Tik Tok. And no, Andy, did nothing to even be ""attacked"" by Bob.",29803,zx49l5,">Then Claire, who touched Bob and her fave onesie was destroyed. Apparently, Bob had cut some pieces of it, while she was sleeping.

I'm sorry, what in the ACTUAL FUCK is wrong with your husband? This is fucked up and sadistic. If he doesn't see what's wrong and express EXTREME remorse, idk how you can reconcile this. He's harming children. For fun. Does he experience empathy? You are NTA. These are pranks he would do in a frat house with teenagers, these are not appropriate for any children. You don't write on a child's face, destroy beloved comfort items, or ruin a birthday party to teach kids to behave. I shudder to think of what other ways he's a terrible father and he should not be surprised when his kids cut him out of their lives once they're old

AITA for embarrassing a lunch thief at work.,"So pretty much the title, I don't think I am the A but I've been getting some flack for it so I really want to clear this up.

So I started a new job recently I work in small studio, there are several others in the building, think open plan office with sections assigned to each studio. The person I had an altercation with doesn't work for my studio just FYI. 

I eat lunch at 1ish and most people eat at 12. I came down ealry to eat at 12, I made coffee and while at the counter noticed my tuppaware in the sink, empty. 

Imagine my surprise when I turned around and saw a man I didn't know sitting down at the table with my food on his plate. He had just stuck it in the microwave. Acting rashly since I was mad, I sat down next to him and said 'hey that looks good, mind if I try it?' Then before waiting for an answer I yanked the plate away from him and snatched his fork out his hand, he just blinked in shock as did the other people there as I started eating.

He then, quite loudly, asked what I thought I was doing and I replied 'huh you know this was actually much better when I first cooked it, it probably lost some flavor in the fridge.' he caught on quickly that it was it was my food and went a lil red. I then asked him where he got the gall to steal someone else's lunch and then ask them what they were doing when they took it back.

He stuttered out some nonsense about not knowing it was mine and I replied well you knew it wasn't yours right? He just mumbled something like an apology and I said that's no problem it was nice he'd warmed it up for me at least, in an admittedly b*tchy tone, and then he just got up and left and the people there just stared in silence. 2 of the silent watchers, maybe his mates idk, told me that I was rude to him and that there had been nicer ways to go about it. I told them to think how they'd feel if someone ate their food before saying they should focus on their lunch and I'll focus on mine.

Well it's been a little awkward at lunch since and I have the impression a few people are talking shite about me at work now, maybe I could've been nicer sure. I still don't think I was wrong but tell me reddit AITA

Tldr lunchthief tried to eat my food in front of me I took it back and embarrassed him in front of his colleagues.

Edit: Okay this blew up, just wanted to drop an edit on here to say thank you so much for all the comments, support and awards it's great to know I wasn't completely overreacting. Maybe I shoudl chat tp some people and see if the food thief has struck before will update then if yall are interested. 

Otherwise additional info, I saw some comments saying I should go to hr but my studio doesn't have hr and the perp doesn't work for the same place, we do have a defacto office manager but I don't want to take it any further since I'm still new here and on probation/think my reaction might have been enough. 

Update: So not sure if anyone wanted an update but I finally found out from a a new friend at work that yes the lunch thief has struck before! Apparently everyone wrote their names on their lunch to combat this, and the thief then targeted unmarked lunch or lunch items, guess no one told me ha. 

People apparently starting being petty and standoff-ish to the thief since and he blames me for that lol. Also according to my new friend most were actually very pleased that the thief was finally identified/dealt with.

I was assured that besides the thief in question and his cronies no one thought I was being a b*tch. However, not knowing much about me, assumed I was a very serious or clique-y person from my reaction, which I mean fair, I dress very professionally when most of the office dresses quite casual which probably added to that (think high heels, blouse and skirt VS shorts, graphic tee and slops). I've started to come down to lunch earlier to chat to some people and the office seems to be warming up to me.

So not a drama filled update but I'm very happy things turned out so well and my reputation with my colleagues is off to a good start, thanks again for all of the comments and support think this will be final edit slash update too, thanks reddit :)",29764,socrlh,"For context, did this happen during covid time?

"AITA for cancelling a check of $12,000 that I wrote for my infertile friend for her next IVF cycle over a joke?","


I (F35) am infertile. My ex husband and I tried everything to have kids but it just never happened. He divorced me, went and married someone younger who was able to give him a kid and from what I gather, they're expecting a 2nd child together. It hurts like hell seeing someone else have what I couldn't. I get frustrated with myself sometimes and with family blaming me for basically everything. I turn to my friends for support, Especially ""Alessia"", she's in the same ""infertility boat"" as me but she and her husband are currently trying IVF hoping it'd work.


Alessia asked me for help to pay for her upcoming IVF cycle. I agreed to write her a check of $12,000, I really wanted to help her and the money came with no strings attached. I wrote the check and gave it to her last week. She was very appreciative of it.


The very next day, I got a sudden message from a mutual friend ""Carol"" with a screenshot of the conversation she had with Alessia. Turns out she and Alessia were talking about the next IVF cycle, and Alessia said she hoped the cycle would work because ""she didn't wanna end up divorced, and having her husband go marry someone younger and have a baby with them and another one on the way! While she's alone and without a family at 35! (She's 32). I was stunned and...hurt, I knew she meant me here. But I did not confront her I simply contacted my bank and cancelled the check. In the evening, Alessia called to ask why I cancelled the check and I told her. She went batshit saying she didn't mean it that way and that she thought that this was somewhat an ""inside joke"" between ""desperate infertile women"". She came over with her husband the next day begging I write another check but I refused. An argument ensued and her husband thought I wasn't being supportive of her like when she supported me throughtout my struggles. She left crying and we haven't talked since then. Her husband keeps reminding me (while repeatedly calling Carol a toxic snake) of the date of the next cycle saying they can't have it after I took the money that was supposed to pay for it back!.


Some friends thinks I'm being oversensitive. Carol's on my side telling me to tell them to go to hell but I feel so bad about it. what I've done might just damage our 15 years of friendship. Maybe I shouldn't have cancelled it but I just felt so offended by what she said about me and how she basically mocked my unfortunate circumstances.


so reddit, AITA?


Hello again! And Wow thank you so so much for all this support and compassion that you've shown me. I could feel it through my screen (LOL 😅🤣) I have decided I'm going to put some distance between me and
Alessia. Things have been rough lately and I think that distance is what I need right now especially for my mental health. After reading some comments here I now feel less heavy and more relieved. Doesn't change the fact that I'm still feel completely and utterly shocked by Alessia's behavior. It's a shame having to come to the realization that even those who are supportive of you the most, could cause as much harm.


Oh and by the way, I sent Carol a link for this thread to see what her thoughts were and she just laughed. She was kind of angry I used her real name but relieved that I used a throwaway LOL.",29558,yfm01l,"holy shiiit, NTA.

"AITA for replying to a coworkers inappropriate texts by work email, and attaching them?","
One of my coworkers who I had thought was friendly but that was it (he is married) sent me some inappropriate texts at like 3 am on St. Patricks Day weekend. 

Asking me to come over and ""have some fun"" and saying that he had been into me for a while and knew I felt the same. (I don't, I'm a lesbian but not out at work)

He also sent me a naked selfie that (luckily) cut off right before his dick but ... Dang it was close. 

When I saw them, I was out with friends and was like ""What the fuck... Ok this is a Monday problem"". I have a really strict rule with myself that I don't do work, think about work, or answer messages about work outside of 9-5 M-F. I also don't use my personal phone for work stuff. If someone from work calls or texts and it's not one of the coworkers I see as a close friend and trust to not talk shop on the weekends, I'm not answering... 

And I included dealing with this fucker as a ""workday problem"" so I ignored his message. He sent me several later first saying sorry he was drunk. Then saying he hadn't said it how he wanted to but he was still into me and had a feeling I felt the same. 

On Monday, I wrote him an email on the work email saying:

 ""Hi 'Coworker'

I'm writing to follow up on your messages from the prior several days (See attached)

Please only contact me through work channels during regular business hours, I do not use my personal number with colleagues.

Additionally, I found the content of your messages unwelcome and inappropriate. Please only contact me regarding work. 

- OP""

I didn't send the email to HR but I did blind CC my personal email so I'd have a copy just in case. 

And he got really mad, he texted me back saying I had crossed a line attaching his picture to a work email, was I trying to get him fired? 

I screenshot that text too and attached it to an additional email saying ""As per my prior email, please only contact me about work matters, and only on my business email or Slack."" 

He stopped texting me but he came to my desk to speak to me and before he said anything I asked ""Is this a work question?"" And he said I knew what it was about, and I said that I wasn't available for a discussion at the moment, if he did need to meet with me for a work matter, could he please schedule a meeting on the calendar and include a readahead to brief me on the topic of the meeting? 

He walked off... 

I feel like I was a bit of a bitch in dealing with it when maybe I could have told him to cut it out by text. But I'm also fucking sick of dealing with this shit at every job, and I feel like my patience to use my own time and energy to gently ask guys to cool it is worn thin. And I want to set the precident that I won't engage at all, outside of work hours or work accounts.

AITA for sending that email?

---

Edit... 

Looks like the overwhelming majority of y'all think I need to go to HR to get ahead of this. I was considering holding off to see if he cools it himself, but the way he came to my desk after being told off twice makes me think that's probably not the best idea. 

I'm gonna forward the emails to HR, write up the conversation we had at my desk, and ask them to meet with me to discuss.

Edit 2... 

 I sent an email to HR this afternoon and they called a meeting with me the same day. I told them everything, though there wasn't a lot to say that wasn't already captured in the emails. And they assured me that I wouldn't have any more contact with him at work. They are going to meet with him tomorrow. 

It's still not decided if he will be fired or if he will be moved to a different position where he won't have any reason to speak to me... I have a feeling it might depend on how he handles the conversation with them? 

I do feel good about emailing HR, I feel like along with myself, I've possibly helped out other women by starting that paper trail if it turns out to be something he's done more than once.

Edit 3...

Holy shit.. I went out to happy hour with a few of my female friends in my field to vent.  And one of my friends told me she'd met this same guy at a professional conference, given him her business card with her phone number, and he sent her a nasty pic too. 

She just replied saying that that was inappropriate and she had a husband, and he said something about her husband not having to know. So she had her husband call him and leave a voicemail telling him to fuck off, and then she never heard from him again. 

I asked her if she'd be okay sending screenshots of the text exchange to my HR contact. She was, and she even wrote that she met him at a professional conference where he was representing the company, she gave him a business card for networking reasons, and he sent her an unsolicited lewd picture. And that she needed her husband to intervene to stop the harassment.

I haven't checked my email again, I'm trying to leave work at work and not dwell on this any more tonight. But it seems like HR will have even more to go off, before meeting with him.

Edit 4...

He was fired. I don't know a lot of details, I have a follow up meeting with HR soon, but my coworkers told me he was escorted out of the building this morning. One of my coworkers who sits near the HR office said they heard him screaming at the HR staff during his meeting this morning... It's crazy how stuff escalated honestly, just last week I thought he was a chill guy. 

I owe a thank you to everyone who told me to report this too; I'd been on the fence at first. But I feel like stuff was gonna escalate either way and I feel a lot safer not having to see him everyday at work.",29512,tmem01,"NTA.

AITA for still going to my dental appointment after my husband tried to get me to reschedule?,"

So I (f34) was having a horrible toothache, I'd taken medication to ease the pain but it was bad, like you-need to go-to the dentist level of bad. I scheduled an appointment and was told to come yesterday.

My husband's (m37) best friend ""Terry"" (m33) got into an accident and injured his knee. he has been staying with us for several weeks. My husband looks after him as he sees him living alone and in need of assistance. I welcomed him to our home but found myself having to clean up after him and bring him his medication and also cook for him. And if I take a long time to get something done he'd call my husband and basically ""tell on me"" which makes my husband mad. he says it's temporary and also since I'm home 24/7 and he is the working then I should help caring for his friend. It has became quite overwhelming because now I can't leave the house if my husband isn't there with his friend.

Like I stated previously about the dental appointment, I told my husband the night before and he pitched a hissy fit saying I can't leave Terry home alone. I suggested he take time off work and stay with him but he said it wouldn't work with such a short notice. he suggested that I reschedule but I said no, even showed him how bad the swelling was, yet he told me to hold on for another day.

He went to work early and I decided I was still going to go. Terry was in the livingroom (he sleeps on a large mattress in the living room) and saw me making my way out as mom was waiting at the door. He asked where I was going and I told him to the dental appointment. He had an attitude and raised his voice at me telling me to go back upstairs and cancel. mom stepped in and started arguing with him asking who he think he is, he went on about how he was unable to move and then threatened to call my husband if I stepped a foot out the door. I took my mom and left. He ended up calling my husband who then tried to call me over and over for 2 hours til I turned my phone off.

Instead of returning home, I went to stay with my mom because I was in tremendous pain and my husband started yelling at me calling me stubborn for still going after he told me to reschedule and irresponsible for leaving his injured friend home alone. Mom told him off which escalated the argument between us. He is now currently staying at home along with his friend while constantly pressuring me to stop hiding behind mom and come deal with the results of having him leave his job for hours after I blind sided him and went against his wishes.

"AITA for interrupting my husband's ""Live stream"" and going off on him after he ""forgot"" to feed and change our daughter's diaper?","

My f32 husband m35 I has a YouTube channel with over 14k followers. He's been doing live streaming a lot lately even though I told him that we have responsibilities to take care of. Before our daughter (she's 7 months old) was born he'd stream randomly and spend lot of time with his ""followers"". Answering questions and engaging in conversations. He keeps saying that his followers are good for his mental health and that engaging with them weekly makes him become better at socializing and communicating.


He's been complaining about wanting to do a live stream for days. I told him we'd look at our schedule and see if we could get him some time to make it happen. Apparently, this wasn't good enough. Yesterday I had to go grocery shopping and asked him to keep an eye on our daughter while she was asleep. He said okay.


I was gone for 4hrs but kept calling him to see if everything was OK. He'd tell me she was alright and that she was sleeping. I started getting this weird feeling something was wrong because, she must've had been hungry or needed a diaper change. He argued that everything was fine. I immediately went home and when I entered the house I didn't find him, I shouted his name but got nothing. I went into the bedroom and saw that my daughter was awake and her diaper wasn't changed...and worse was that her bottle was even touched. I was confused I got out and noticed that his office's door was closed. I figured he was doing a live streaming from the noise I heard. I was beyond seething I barged into the office and saw him sitting. I blew up while he was trying to turn his mic off and telling me to stop but I didnt stop. I berated him for leaving our daughter unattended and with no milk nor diaper change. He freaked out on me saying I just ended his entire channel and destroyed his fan base for interrupting his live stream and embarrassing and scandalized him like that. I told him to not say a word but he kept yelling calling me out of control and unhinged. He was almost crying so I had to leave the office.


He kept fighting with me til I decided to go stay with my mom. He started blaming me for ignoring his needs after he already expressed them and that he forgot to do what I asked him and I'd cost him so much. Now us telling to come back home because he misses his daughter.",29247,w1l464,"NTA. He neglected your child for hours.

AITA for “weaponizing my femininity” by crying since the teacher wouldn’t stop another student harassing me ?,"UPDATE at the bottom 


Edit2: Since many people are sending me DMs, me and my dads went to the principal today. Will post an update when the situation is solved. 

Edit: please remove if not allowed mods. I’m talking to my dads today and will ask them to got he principal with me  , the comments here made a little sacred about how wrong this could go and how bad was the situation. Will post an update if things can be posted online. 

Also I’m not in USA, even if this sound fake to you,  here in South America things are really this bad guys. 

—-
For a little backstory, I (15f) lost my mom when I was 5, dad raised me alone until last year when my second dad, whom I call papa, moved to our home. Now we are a happy family of four (me, two dads and dog). 

I’m not ashamed of my family so I never hid it, I’m not really popular at school so I just really told my friends and it was all good. Until about two months ago a boy I’ll call Duncan (15m) found out. 

Duncan started simple with jokes like “wow which one of them is the mom?” Which I promptly told the teacher, Mr.Smith, who was like “He’s just trying to understand, if you want people to understand you have to be patient”. 

Duncan started to escalate with “Enjoy your time here, it’ll get worse when your sinner family goes to hell” and again I went to Mr.Smith who again was “You can’t be prejudiced with his religion, it’s wrong in the Bible. He’s is just trying to understand.”

In my country every class has only one responsible teacher so I couldn’t go to another btw. 

I have many examples but this paints the picture. After two months of that I realized that if I wanted him to stop I had to do it myself. 

So when he started with his homophobic shit at the cafeteria I started to remember the saddest thing I could, all movies where the dog dies. All the sad romance movies. Mufasas’ Death. The Fox and The Hound. 

It didn’t take long for the waterworks to come. I started to bawl. Ugly sobbing while basically screaming at him asking why he said I would go to hell, why he hated me and my dads. Just making a huge scene.  Duncan started to stutter and plead, trying to make me go to class with him and talk to the teacher (wonder why). I just cried louder and flinched when he tried to pull me away. 

The scene was so huge that we ended up  at the principals office. Ms.Yates listened to both sides and she was pissed at Mr. Smith, she let me tell the whole story even when Mr. Smith tried to interrupt me to defend Duncan. At the end Duncan got a 5 day suspension and the principal told me to go directly to her if ANYTHING like that happens again. 

When we left the office Mr.Smith stoped me and told me “I hope you’re happy. You put a permanent mark on a good boy’s record because you decided to weaponize your femininity instead of being a little understanding.” He tried to make me apologize to Duncan but I told him I would go right back to the principals office if he did and he dropped it. 

Then later Duncan’s friends started messaging me accusing me of acting like amber heard and ruining a boys life just because I can. 

I didn’t tell my parents yet because they are always afraid I’ll suffer because they choose to love each other and I’ll not bring anything I can handle to worry them. 

I don’t feel like I’m wrong, but with Mr.Smith’s warning and Duncan’s friends I’m starting to doubt , so AITA?

FINAL EDIT AND UPDATE


Mods told me to update here so the post is quite long, sorry!

First I’d like to thank you guys for opening my eyes to how bad the situation was and how it could get worse, and how I was hurting my dads by not letting them protect me like I want to protect them. 

Now to the update: Sunday I sat my dads down and told them everything, I was crying a bit  in the end since while telling them I realized how heavy it felt to be carrying all this.

Sunday was the first time I saw the angry side of Adam (will just use names since the nickname I use in my language clash with English), not at me like but at Mr.Smith. He saw red but the first thing was reassure me I was not in trouble and would never be for fighting against bullies. Dad didn’t talk much, he seemed so sad and shocked just holding my hand, but Adam talked more than I ever heard about his past. About bullying from teachers, students , church and even family. 

He told me about how cruel the world can be to who is different, how people will try to silent me and minimize my anger and my suffering and to never back down, that I will always have my family behind me. 
He thanked me for loving them so much that I was willing to fight for them, but told me I was the child here, his child that he never imagined he could have and that he would protect me. 

I didn’t realize how much he loved me. I knew he liked me, he is my family, but I felt just as loved as when dad tells me he loves me. It was a very nice and warm feeling. 

Adam and Dad went to school with me on Monday, straight to Ms.Yates office and told her everything; about the texts (I had them all on my WhatsApp), about Mr.Smith and I explained the bullying in more details. 

Their conversation was long and after I gave all the info I could, I was asked to leave to class while they talked and only knew the result when I came back home. 

My dads gave Ms.Yates two choices: She removes Mr.Smith from teaching and do a seminar with the teachers about bullying and LGBT causes that my dads are willing to pay for. Or they remove me from the school, sue the school and go to the local newspaper with the story. 

She choose the first option but asked for a month to find another teacher. Meanwhile she will monitor my class closely and Mr.Smith won’t be allowed to penalize my grades like some you guys feared. 

Apparently Adam has a bit more experience dealing with this shit than I knew. 

But he also explained to me about privilege and that talking worked so well this time because this is a private school that worries about money and reputation and we have enough money to fight, pay for a lawyer and sue. He told me that many of children from public schools, like his childhood, have to suffer in silence because they don’t have the support we got this time.

So, nothing really extraordinary, it all went like many of you guys predicted: Duncan will keep being my classmate but at least Mr.Smith won’t bully any more of us, he was the real asshole in the situation. 

Also my Papa is awesome and a badass.",29227,vfnpcs,"NTA

Go back to the principal and let her know what your teacher said, as well as what Duncan's friends are messaging you about. I know you don't want to get your parents involved, but I'd also suggest you do that. 

As it stands, you can't approach Mr. Smith for non-homophobia related issues right now as well, because I wouldn't trust him to do anything. Speak to your principal, and ask if you can be switched to another class. 

I should note:

> the principal told me to go directly to her if ANYTHING like that happens again

It already has. Your teacher's comments were unacceptable, and Duncan's friends are being horrific. Going to her would simply be doing as she asked you to.",10495,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vfnpcs/aita_for_weaponizing_my_femininity_by_crying/,"['update', 'bottom', 'edit',

AITA for getting an entire table for myself after my husband and his mom didn't save me a seat?,"
I'll start this off by saying that I, f32 have been with my husband Bob, m39 for 3 years, married for one. His mom has a habit of keeping me out of most of their functions with the excuse of ""you work too much"". Not true because sometimes I do make myself available but yet find myself excluded. 

Last week. His mom invited us for a celebratory dinner at the restaurant after she completed her recovery. I had to with that day but I ket her and everyone know that I'd be there at 8pm. Bob obviously knew I was coming. 

Thing is, when I arrived to the restaurant I saw that the table was full. All chairs had been taken and I just stood there with complete puzzlement while Bob and his mom just stared at me. His mom then told me there was no place left for me and that I could either have Bob get up and take his seat or .... go home. 

I was so upset but instead of going home I just went and took an entire table for me. Bob and his mom watched with their eyes popping out of their heads like they saw something so shocking... NGL I did get weird looks from the guests but so did Bob and his mom. It was awkward in all honesty. 

I had my dinner, dessert, then went home. I saw Bob and his mom staring grudgingly while I was making my way out. He got home an hour later and yelled saying I embarrassed his mom infront of her guests. I yelled asking WTF was I supposed to do after I got denied a seat and he told me that it wasn't his nor his mom's fault guests arrived ""before"" me and took all the available chairs. I told him he could've saved me a chair!!!!!. he said that I could've just left instead, and reminded me that I was a ""guest"" and that I shouldn't expect this level of entitlement to be ""accepted"". He then went on about how I ruined the entire dinner for him and his mom with what I did and has been pouting about it for days now.

AITA for going home after I overheard my husband say he didn't want to bring me with him to his family vacation?,"
My husband goes on annual vacations with his family. I'm on okay terms with them but since we've only been married for a short time and I don't see his family much, we still have that barrier that keeps is from being completely comfortable around each other.
His family arranged for the vacation last week. I out of curiosity asked if I could come. My husband felt hasitant but I told him it'd be a great opportunities to get to know his family better. He agreed to take me and his family were surprised to see me but still welcomed me.
On the 3rd day of the vacation. His dad, mom, brothers and spouses were all sitting at a table outside talking while I was preparing a fruit salad. As I was making my way back I overheard my MIL say ""...did she really had nowhere else to spend the weekend?"". At first I had no idea who she was talking about so I kept on walking, but stopped once I overheard my husband say ""l KNOW!!!! And I didn't want to bring her with me but what was I supposed to do?!!! You know how pushy she can get"". I instantly figured it was about me. I felt so shaken up to the point where I almost dropped the salad. This whole time I was there I cleaned, cooked, looked after the kids and this is how they think of me? An inconvenience to them?.

I quietly booked a ticket and went home on the first plane. He called and texted but I didn't respond anything other than let him know I was home. He got back and went off on me saying what I did was disrespectful and juvenile. I told him I overheard the conversation he had with his mom but he said that I was wrong for eavesdropping and that his family will warm up to me on their terms so I should stop pushing to be around that when they don't feel comfortable with it. Basically saying it was my fault for coming along in the first place. He said that going home like made him and his family disappointed and gave them a really bad impression about me.

AITA for celebrating my birthday which is the 1 year anniversary of my nephew's death?,"My (25F) nephew (4M) passed away 1 year ago because of cancer. It was right on my birthday and there was no celebration, there was nothing, because everyone was devastated. 

My sister Denise is still grieving, she's in therapy and making some progress, but it's been slow. My family and I try to be as supportive as possible. 

Birthdays in my family are very important, we throw huge parties, I believe and have been taught that birthdays are important and should be cherished. 

Yesterday was my birthday. Obviously I felt bad about the anniversary of my nephew's death, but I was also a little down about not being able to celebrate like I used to and my girlfriend knew that. 

In the morning, I went to Denise's house, stayed by her side until almost lunch time, when my mother would stay with her (we didn't want to leave her alone, but no one could stay all day). 

I went to work and at night, my girlfriend made a surprise at home with a candlelight dinner and a small cake. Something very intimate and for both of us, since my family was in a bad way. 

I didn't post on social media, but my girlfriend posted a picture of us holding hands and the dinner she made with ""Happy Bday, Love"". My mom and Denise follow her on Instagram. 

I woke up the next day to hundreds of texts from my mom and Denise, asking if I was celebrating even though it was such a sad day and how heartless I was to celebrate knowing my sister was in such a bad way. Even though I said it was a surprise, they called me cold, heartless and insensitive to the pain of others, saying I should have refused to celebrate. 

I was just glad I celebrated, because it's something important to me and I didn't even realize when my girlfriend posted this photo on insta. 

Btw, in case you were wondering, none of them remembered it was my birthday.

"AITA for uninviting my cousin, brother, uncle and dad to my wedding over a prank?","

I f22 grew up in a family where men prank and tease each others. eversince my fiance (Tim 23) and I got engaged, my cousin, brother, dad and uncle joked about running some 'tests' to see what ""type"" of man Tim is. They've done stuff like forcing him to play chess 4 times in a raw, secretly slashed his tires to see if he'd fix it himself like a man or get help like those ""lazy"" guys, They'd asked him questions like what joke he'd like to tell his future MIL, his opinions on abortion, jesus, gender equality etc. They also tested his fishing and hunting skills, overwhelmed him with hypothetical scenarios to test his decision making abilities/mental strength. They kept calling him slow and soft but he has medical condition (asthma) but they think he's making 'excuses'. I demanded they stop, but dad said this is just typical stuff men challenge each others with and said that I was ruining the fun.



Last week, They took Tim on a 3 day trip and hid his inhaler, he left them and returned in 7hrs and told me, I was seething after he said they admitted to hiding it as a ""challenge"", I exploded on them when they returned. Cousin asked if ""little timmy ran to me to tattle"". I yelled that all 4 of them are uninvited to my wedding. My brother freaked out saying it was a prank and they were going to give it back, Dad said they'll apologize if I insist but Tim will have lost the little respect they'd gained for him and in their eyes will always be ""the soft college kid"" who's not up for the challenge. I called him and the others awful then I left. 

My cousin is begging that we talk, my uncle has been quiet, but dad is so mad and now he's getting mom involved to get me to reconsider this decision. But I keep refusing to re invite them. Mom is saying I'm exaggerating and should let bygones be bygones and not let this ruin my relationship with my family.

"AITA for sending an invoice to my wife's cousin after she ""didn't have space for us"" at her wedding?","I own a printing company that I run with my wife. Her cousin came to us and wanted us to do all the signage, banners, guest books, life-sized cutouts, etc for her wedding. 

We do this all the time for friends' weddings and events, and we never charge. We're happy to help out and it's usually a lot of fun working together to make some cool stuff.

A few weeks before the wedding, her wedding planner tells us they need all the items by X date so they can set it up for the wedding. At this point, we hadn't received our wedding invitations and didn't even know when the actual wedding was. 

My wife texts her and tries to clarify when the wedding is and if we missed the invitation somehow. Her cousin replies and says ""Oh we downsized the wedding and we decided to have like a close friends and family thing"" and that they didn't have space for us in the small venue.

My wife and I are pretty hurt and insulted. And on top of it, we've spent close to $2000 on all the materials. Her cousin and the wedding planner kept making tiny revisions to the artwork, had us print samples to see how it would look in person, resized several of the items a few times, etc. All that cost a ton of time and money. And we're a functioning business, so we either had to delay other orders or stay late and print her stuff on our own time.

So I went ahead and billed her for our cost and said we needed payment before delivery because I'm not going to chase her for payment for months/years after the wedding. We're not making money on it, just charged her for the cost of materials. 

So far we've gotten threatening calls from the cousin, her fiance, some random members of my wife's family that I don't know, some of the groomsmen, etc essentially calling us assholes.

After the harassment, I'm considering charging full price or else we won't deliver the items.

"AITA for calling my brother a “disgusting gross, man,” at his daughter’s birthday party?","Throwaway.

My brother, “Paul,” and I are not close at all. We have very different worldviews and have incompatible personalities. I can tolerate him, but I would never consider him a friend. He’s been married to “Lisa,” for one or two years now and they have a beautiful daughter together.

My girlfriend, “Amy,” and I were invited to celebrate my niece's first birthday. Most of the family was invited, and it would be the first time I would have seen them all together (I only see my family once or twice a year, with a few exceptions.) 

Amy and I arrived a little earlier than we were supposed to and instead of waiting in the car, we decided to go in. The first thing I noticed is how calm my brother seemed to be in contrast to Lisa, who was frantically running up and down. When he saw Amy, he immediately handed the baby over to her and got a beer to sit down and watch TV. Lisa was clearly struggling, and he was content with a beer and Netflix. 

I don’t want to be rude and maybe this was a one-time thing but it bothered me how uninvolved he was. He handed Amy a baby with a full diaper with vomit on its clothes.

Eventually Amy, Lisa and I finished everything. The house was clean, the food was ready, and Lisa looked ready to host a big gathering. We all paid zero attention to Paul. 

When my family arrived, I thought everything was going well. I avoided Paul and enjoyed speaking to my family. After we had sat down to eat, Paul approached me, drunk, thanking me for helping Lisa. I did not want to be around him for long and moved out of his way.

He was very persistent.

I was ignoring him but he started talking about Amy. “Protect Amy like a “real” man.” or “You’ve got a great woman by your side.” You know what, whatever. It was slightly odd and mildly uncomfortable, but I was able to brush it away. Amy was trying to sober him up a little bit before the cake-cutting so she was “selectively hearing.” 

We tried to get him to stop talking and drink water. However, he had a lot to say about Lisa. He was complaining about how pregnancy “ruined” Lisa’s body and how a baby ruined his life. Amy and I kept looking at each other awkwardly and we were soon going to leave him be. 

We didn’t leave the conversation soon enough.

He was complaining to be about his sex life, or lack thereof,  and commenting on how desperately he wanted to have sex with someone “fit like Amy.” 

This made the both of us extremely uncomfortable. Amy left, quickly apologising to Lisa. I told him that he was a “disgusting, gross man who needs some fucking help,” before I left. 

Apparently, this made him super upset and he started wailing at the party. Paul told everyone that the reason he was crying was because of my words to him.

AITA for telling my SIL she can leave Christmas dinner when she freaked out over tampons?,"Okay, she’s not my SIL yet but I used it to make the title simpler. She’s my boyfriend’s borther’s girlfriend.

I (f28) have been with my boyfriend (m32, Ian) for 3 years. We’ve decided to host a small, early Christmas dinner. One of the people invited was his brother, Jake (m26). Jake asked if he could bring his girlfriend as she was all alone (they’ve been together for 3 months) and we agreed, the more the merrier. His girlfriend, Naveah (f28) seemed a bit timid but lovely. Naveah brought her 8 year old son (that we didn’t know was coming).

She seemed lovely right until she went to the bathroom, she came out shrieking,box of my tampon she in her hand, literally gasping for air in between her shrieks. I could barely understand her. Turns out, my box of tampons was visible (duuuh, it’s within a reach because hey, I need it monthly, why should I hide it and then look for it). She was going off about being disgusting, how could I be so shameless to have this in front of a child and other men and so on.

I looked at her in disbelief, I couldn’t believe she made a scene about a box of tampons, has she never been in a shop?

Anyway, I told her that my tampons stay where they are but if she’s so pressed, she can leave and go home where no tampons are present. She turned red, quite literally, her face was bright pink. Huffing and puffing, she dressed her kid and told Jake to drive her home which he did.

Jake didn’t come back but he called from her house telling Ian that I was the asshole. I was surprised to hear that Ian (my boyfriend) agreed with him. I thought he would be on my side. We were about to argue but I decided it wasn’t worth it and went to my office to cool down and think this through.

AITA for telling my boyfriend that he can't date younger and then get upset about my budget apartment?,"
So I recently got together with a guy from my hobby, he asked me out first and I had some doubts that we'd work together as a couple because of the age difference, he's 35 and I'm 22.

So, in my apartment, since it's an old house that was originally a single family house, there isn't much soundproofing. And the floors creak when people move. 

I've gotten used to the sound of the guy upstairs getting up at 4 am since he starts work at 5.

And the sound of the girls in the apartments to either side of mine watching telenovelas till midnight, taking work calls all day and having friends over on weekend nights. 

I know when I play music or have friends over, some of the sound leaks through the walls. So I'd never get upset about hearing my neighbors because it goes both ways. 

So... When my boyfriend started coming over more often, he had complaints about the neighbors. Which put me in an awkward place, he wanted to go speak to them or have me text them and I said no. 

For example, one of the early times he stayed over we went to bed around 10. He wanted me to ask my neighbor to turn down her TV. I said she didn't have it that loud and she turns it off at midnight anyway. 

At 4 am, he got very irritated with my upstairs neighbor getting up and cooking breakfast. I said that he would be done by 5 because that's when his shift starts. 

At 7 am, he was still trying to sleep in and the neighbor on the other side had some work calls that he said he couldn't sleep through. I offered him earplugs and he said he couldn't sleep with them in either, he wanted me to ask her to quiet down.

He had similar comments every time he heard someone else in the building just living their life especially if it was when he was in bed. 

I got frustrated with my boyfriend and told him ""you know, you can't expect to date a 'hot young' 22 year old and not wanna deal with a 22 year olds living situation! I don't know if you realize but this is a normal apartment for someone my age... Hell, my neighbors are pretty great; nobody's throwing loud parties on work nights, nobody's having screaming fights, nobody's having babies!"" 

(The 'hot young' part was in sarcastic air quotes because those were his words not mine)

He got irritated and asked why I was bringing age into it, and I said it's because he can't both want someone so young and also want someone with house kinda money! And he was being so out of touch with how normal people in their 20s live.

He got really irritated with me bringing age into it, and even more annoyed when I'd respond to his neighbor complaints in the future with ""ok boomer"" or tell him that if he wanted me to have a ""rich person apartment"" he could pay for it. 

AITA for what I said to my boyfriend about my apartment?

Edit - A lot of comments are asking if we could stay at his house

It's not possible for me to get to his house on my own because I don't have a car and the buses don't go that far into the suburbs. 

 So that would mean him driving 30 minutes from his house in the suburbs to pick me up, then an extra 30 to drive me to his house. Then an hour round trip early in the morning to get me home in time for work. 

It's a lot easier for him to visit me in the city.

Edit 2 - a lot of people in the comments are saying Technically 35 is a milennial and not a boomer. I know that.

 I am using boomer as A JOKE or a figure of speech to say ""acting out of touch and entitled to tell other people what to do"". It is a common figure of speech to say ""ok boomer"" to someone who is acting entitled regardless of their actual age... It's more of a mindset thing.

Edit 3 - I googled his property records for his house and HE CO OWNS IT WITH A WOMAN WHO SHARES HIS LAST NAME! holy shit... I don't know if she's his wife or ex wife or what but I'm OUT OF HERE.

AITA for what I said after my husband commented on my flat chest?,"

My husband Jared and I have been married for 3 years. He's currently out of work (used to work at a high paying job but got kicked out the company over a fight with a co worker) and I'm the one paying for rent and utilities.

We dedicate some time to see his family weekly. They don't know he's unemployed because he thought they'll see him as a failure especially his mom so he told me to keep it a secret.


Last night we were sitting eating dinner at the table. His cousin was talking about his fiancee going to brazil to do a boob job. Jared asked if he was serious then ""flattered"" FSIL's boobs saying they're perfect and that he didn't understand why she'd get a boob job. He then turned to me, stared at my chest while I was eating like an idiot (I have a flat chest, I'm insecure about it but can't do anything about it obviously) and said ""Hey why don't YOU get a boob job, you're the one who needs it the most"". His mom gasped and was like "" JARED!?? "" I said ""It's fine!""  I then turned to him and said ""I'll get a boob job once YOU get an ACTUAL JOB since you've been unemployed for 6 months now$!!"", He stared at me in disbelief. his mom began questioning him about being unemployed and he denied denied denied then admitted it was true. It got awkward with his mom scolding him and others shaming him for it and for hiding it. He got so overwhelmed he went outside and stayed inside the car til I came.

He started yeling at me repeatedly ""you coudn't have held your effing tongue?!!"", And accused me of turning his family against him and having them jugge then shun him now he can't even step a foot in their house from shame and guilt. I argued that his comment about my chest was insulting, but he said he was giving me a piece of advice and that there is nothing wrong with him wanting me to look pretty and that he said what he said out of support and encouregemnt, but I what I did was the complete opposite and that it was intented to hurt him and I succeeded.


He dropped me off at home then went to stay with his buddies. I called him later thinking he calmed down but his friend said he didn't want to speak to me and I shoud give him space.",28663,u6ec6m,"You were just encouraging him to get a job :)

AITAA for taking my niece to court over a coat?,"I(28F) have a niece (16F). She is my only sister's only child.

2 years ago I married a very wealthy man (34M), and because of the pandemic, last Christmas was my first with my in-laws.

My MIL gifted me a coat that is worth more than $20k (I saw her wearing it, asked her where she bought it, and she said that it will be my Christmas gift from her).

I didn't know how much it was (I knew it was expensive, but I thought maybe $3k at most). I was visiting my sister last January when my niece saw it, she googled the brand and showed me how much it really was. I won't lie, I didn't wear it after that because I was afraid of ruining it.

Last week, I wore it while visiting my sister. While I was putting it back on to leave, I felt something go *splat* on my back, then my niece started cackling and the smell of paint hit me. I was so pissed off while she was not apologitic at all. Her mom screamed at her and said she was grounded. Then she said she will pay for the dry cleaning.

While I was in my car, still in shock BTW, I got an alert that my niece posted a reel, it was of her *doing a prank* on me, and she said ""I'm going to hit my aunt's $20k coat with a paint filled balloon to see how she reacts"". I saved it on my phone, sent it to her mom and told her that a week's grounding is not enough. She did not reply, but I saw that my niece took it down (it got less than 5 views by then).

The next day I found out my coat can not be saved, so I called my sister and told her that her daughter has to pay it back. Well, we got into an argument and she said that they will not be paying it, and if I wanted a new one, I should get my husband to buy it for me. I think that they should pay for it (they can afford to, IMO they should sell my niece's car and pay me back my money). 

We did not reach an agreement, so I told her that I will be suing, and reminded her that I have video evidence that her daughter A) did it on purpose for online clout and B) knew exactly how expensive it was.

People in my life are not objective at all, I have some calling me an AH, some saying they are the AHs for not buying me a new one, and some so obsessed with the price of the coat that they are calling me an AH for simply owning it and wanting a new one.

So AITA?

Edit: sorry for not making it clearer, but my coat was bought new, just identical to my MIL's.",28634,za73bi,"NTA.

AITA for still going to my sister's wedding after my husband canceled my plane ticket?,"
EDIT - UPDATE ON MY PAGE - 

Here's the situation. My husband [36] and I [30] have 3 kids [2, 4, 7] . I'm a sahm (full time) and I take care of the kids while my husband works (full time).


My sister's wedding was last week. We live hours away which is an issue for my husband. When we first got the invite he told me that he wasn't going, that he will stay for the kids and suggested I do the same. Since the wedding doesn't allow kids and my husband doesn't want to hire a babysitter after the one we had robbed us. We had gone back and forth on this. but I insisted on going since that's my only sister and I want to attend what might be a once in a lifetime event for her. He chuckled at my statemtment then we stopped talking about it.


As the wedding was appraoching, He brought it up and told me to miss it and stay with the kids. I suggested that since no babysitters were allowed then, I could get my friend to stay with the kids but he refused. I ignored him, spoke to my friend who agreed to watch the kids and booked a ticket to travel to my sister's town in time.

My husband found out and went on about how he had work, and that the most logical solution is that I stay home with the kids and let him make his living. I told him that I already took care of the kids and they'll stay with my friend. Honestly? I grew inpatient. The day of my flight I dropped the kids off at my friend's place then headed to the airport. I found out he had canceled my plane ticket. I was upset but still insisted on going so I went home and got into my car and drove 4hrs to get to the town.


At 5pm. My husband called and was freaking out on me asking where I was. I told him I made it to my sister's town and he blew up saying I wasn't supposed to go, even said he canceled my ticket to get me to stay. He demanded I return but I said not until the wedding was over. He called me horrible, neglectful mom then had his mom scold me and accuse me of abandoning my own kids. There was a huge argument ensued when I returned home and my husband kept on saying I was horrible to leave the kids and to ignore him like that and do what I wanted eventually. He's giving me silent treatment as of now and I can no longer take it. I felt guilty and did NOT enjoy the wedding AT ALL.


Was I wrong for still going?



[INFO] My husband dislikes my sister if it's relevant.


UPDATE: So a lot of people on here brought up the possibility of my husband lying about the robbery that happened months ago and accusing the babysitter of stealing just so I can't hire any other babysitters. He was the one who discovered the ""robbery"" I never saw or talked her after he kicked her out. Upon reading the comments I'm now suspecting that he made this whole thing up. I'm going to contact the babysitter to get the whole story from..Hopefully I'm wrong but I will talk to her and see if her story contredicts his in any way.

AITA for showing up to my husband's Dr appointment?,"
My husband has been dealing with sone health issues the past few weeks and has been frequently visiting the dr. I asked if I could go with him but he refused saying it wouldn't be neccesary and when I asked why he wouldn't want me with him he said he felt more comfortable having privacy with his doctor. I jokingly asked if his doctor was a women and he glanced at me.


I anticipated his next dr appointment and decided to go meet him there. He went and 10 minutes later I entered the office (I identified myself as his wife) and he was shocked when he saw me. I greeted his doctor (a man lol) and we talked but my husband refused to even look my way and refused to speak as well.


We left the office together and he went off on me in the car saying I shouldn't have ""followed"" him and came into the dr office after he asked me for some privacy. I said it was alright I'm his wife I already even know what his issues are and just wanted to show support. He said I overstepped his one boundary and refused to respect his wish and made him more stressed than he already is in these hard times he's going through.

AITA for keeping the engagement ring and giving up asking to propose (after propose) in front of my parents and in-laws?,"My (25F) girlfriend, Molly (26F) for the last... 6 months started with a joke that I've already made clear that I don't like. It consists of her saying ""No"" quickly to anything I ask.

 I know it sounds silly, but I ask her to get a glass of water for me, she says no and after 1 minute, I'm almost getting up, she says she's joking and gets some water. I ask her to wash the dishes, she says no.... I say I LOVE YOU, she says no... I ask her to take her clothes, she says no. Everything is joking and after 30s/1min, she does it, but she is ""addicted"" to doing it.

 I've already made it clear several times that I don't like it, even more so in I LOVE YOU (she's the only person I can say that, so it's special to me). And there are things that are serious and I need her to answer seriously. And if she says no to everything jokingly, I can't tell when she's saying a real no (it's already happened). 

I keep saying this is boring and I don't like it, she stops doing it and goes back to doing it after a week. After a brief discussion because she played this prank in front of our friends (Me asking ""love, can you get me some medicine?"" and she with No kidding), she stopped doing it for 1 month. 

Yesterday, we welcomed my parents, in-laws and our 2 best friends to our house. Everyone knew that I was going to propose to her and I called them, because we always planned this proposal with our loved ones attending, participating in this special day. 

I asked her to marry me and she said a quick NO and I was so grumpy/panic/upset (everyone looking in shock) for 30s for her to laugh and say she was joking, finally saying YES. 

I was so embarrassed and…disappointed? I put the ring box back in and said I'd take it out to cool off. I didn't even let her say anything. 

She kept texting me (no answering calls), saying it was just a joke and that I knew she always did that. She said that I left an difficult situation in the house because it was very clear that I had given up on propose and did in front of my parents and in-laws. She stressed that I was making the situation uncomfortable because of a silly joke. 

Well, I slept in a hotel and I'm still in it. 

My parents supported me, but my in-laws calling me AH for giving up on proposing, disproportionately humiliating their daughter.

 I just really think there's time for jokes and that moment wasn't clearly, she knew I didn't like it and decided to do it anyway. 

AITA?",28452,wloe2s,"NTA.

Out of all the things that are wrong from her side, one that stands out to me the most is that afterward she still puts the blame on you and does not even apologize. If you see that your partner is hurt by something you did (yes, even a joke) any well-adjusted human being would apologize.

Also, if other people are not laughing, I wouldn't even call it a joke. And you are correct to think that there is time and place for jokes. I can imagine how hurtful and embarrassing it was to hear the ''no'' to your proposal in front of your family. Such a dick move.

AITA for throwing out my husband's dinner after he went to eat at his mom's house?,"
My mother-in-law calls every night to ask what we're having for dinner. Then she brags about what she's cooking to make me look bad, especially if we're getting takeout. I used to care but not anymore. But my husband would ask me to make dinner only for him to go eat the dinner his mom makes at her home. which's 10 minutes away and using the ""that's my favorite meal"" excuse.


Yesterday, I wanted to surprise him by cooking one of his favorite meals and although I was busy, I took time off work to cook. I even went grocery shopping to get what I needed. Later as I was setting the table his mom called, I told him he didn't have to answer but he did. like usual...she asked what we were having but acted surprised that I cooked this meal. She then went on to tell him she cooked X meal and told him to come over. He said ok which shocked me, I said ""seriously?"" as he started dresing up getting ready to leave. he told me no offense but this meal (that his mom cooked) was even more of a favorite than the one I cooked. and grabed his keys and left.


I felt awful. I took his plate and threw it out then ate my portion. As I was about to put the plate in the dishwasher, he got home looking angry saying his mom lied about cooking that favorite meal, and used it as an excuse to force him to eat dinner with her. I was shocked but he sat down telling me to go ahead and reheat dinner. I told him no dinner after he abandoned it, I threw it out. He said what?? and I told him he disrespected my time and effort and chose to go eat woth his mom instead. He began yelling at me asking if I really did that then called me petty and horrible then went upstairs saying what I did was 100 times worse than what his mom did.

I definately feel like I let my anger and frustration get the best of me but it really felt unbearable having to live like this for so long. By the way [I'm 26 and he's 28].

ETA to make one thing clear and that's the fact that my husband only does this when it comes to food. He lived with his mom (attended community college) and loved and still loves her food and is used to it. She gave me recipes to make and I try to do that but he keeps switching homes just to eat what he feels like.



**UPDATE** Hi 👋 I posted my situation here almost 24hrs ago and haven't really read every single comment because - Wow there's just too many. I saw few pieces of advice and encouregment and I'm so so thankful for them 💝. But just wanted to let you guys know something since this is a throwaway account and I will be abandoning it soon. I just wanna let you know that I will be sitting down with my husband soon (after he breaks the silence I'm just giving him the space he said he wanted) and I'm going to show him this post in hopes he'd see how none of this was my fault. I will also be pushing for couples counseling although he's always been against it but we'll see how things go...I'm not gonna lie I still feel upset and like my efforts aren't being appreciated, His mom is definately onto something with her little upsetting stunts. I realize how important boundaries are - but also realize how enforcingbcan he difficult. I'm hoping and praying that we will tackle this issue so that our marriage won't suffer but if he's still somehow unable to do his part then that's on him and I'm no longer willing to go through similar stuff and just take it you know.


So yeah, This is it. I honestly didn't realize my post was going to gain this much attention. I might add my original account just in case some of y'all wanted to talk (got plenty of time and space for internet besties because my INBOX was blowing up lol) and maybe I will post updates from there if I could.

AITA for returning my daughter's birthday cake after I discovered that my wife made changes to it?,"I (M37) have a daughter (now 13) ""Olivia"" from my former relationship. Currently, I'm married to my wife who has adaughter (16) ""Britney""


So, Britney is the opposite of Olivia. for example, Britney s a social kid, Olivia is introvert. the list is long but they're just the complete oposite.

Olivia's 13th birthday was 2 days ago. She loves chocolate and I decided this is the flavor I was going to go with when I contacted the bakery. However, my wife objected since Britney absolutely hates chocolate and suggested we go with Vanilla. I said no way because for one, Olivia hates vanilla and it's also her birthday so, she gets to have her cake with her favorites flavor. My wife got upset and took it as in I had no regard for Britney and that we should just choose another netural flavor instead. I shut that down and said no more discussing this because I'd already decided to go with what Olivia wanted.


At the day of the birthday, I was supposed to go get the cake but I was surprised to see my wife coming home after picking up the cake from the bakery. I looked at it and discovered that it wasn't a chocolate cake but a vanilla cake with small pieces of chocolate on top. I got pissed thinking they got my order wrong and was about to contact them, but my wife said there was no mistake and that she called the bakery the day before and made ""slight changes"" to the cake to please both girls. I was stunned I lost it on her and asked why the hell she did that. She got defensive saying that birthdays are no ""excuse"" to show favoritism and that her daughter is ""watching"" and ""observing"" how I'm treating both girls. I told her off since I was the one paying then called the bakery and explained what happened. I had the cake returned and replaced with a chocolate cake. although this one is smaller but it was fine.


My wife declined to take part in the celebration and later we got into a huge argument where she called me controlling and selfish for returing the cake instead of using this opportunity to teach Olivia to compromise so everyone's happy. now I'm teaching her to be ""selfish"". I said that my daughter gets to act ""selfish"" on her birthday and that she (my wife) was teaching her daughter to be entitled. Word for word and it led to a bigger argument. We're not talking as of now.


AITA for returning the cake and not taking my wife's input into consideration?",28270,y0dmoo,"Your wife has told you outright who she is and, I think she might have even said she knows she is mistreating your daughter.  Especially with this line:

>She got defensive saying that birthdays are no ""excuse"" to show favoritism and that her daughter is ""watching"" and ""observing"" how I'm treating both girls.

I have found, with abusive people, they often accuse you of doing what they are doing.  Right here, she is randomly telling you that the daughters are seeing how you treat them - makes me think she knows Olivia sees the shit she's been pulling, stuff you haven't seen, and knows she's in the wrong so is totally putting it on you.

I would sit your daughter down for a heart to heart honest conversation and ask what she's been going through since the marriage.  Take her out to a nice hot chocolate place.

 I would then suggest heavily you go to family therapy.

AITA for tricking my in-laws into trying my food?,"This isn’t necessarily my proudest moment but I am tired of being the outcast.

My (32f) husband “Pete” (34m) comes from a family where the women are all bakers. I am a baker myself and I used to sell out of my house under my states cottage laws but stopped because I like it just being a hobby.

His SIL “Kay” (39) is the one who is “known” for her cupcakes and cake pops.  When I first met everyone years ago, it was the first thing I learned.  Everyone talked about everything she made.  Even when Pete mentioned how good my stuff was, everyone would say that Kay sells hers and they’re popular so they must be better.  Whenever I bring treats, they are often left untouched because “they are not Kay’s”.  Yes, I’ve been told that.  They ask me to bring something every get together and never touch it.  

To be clear, Kay is mainly a baker whereas I bake and specialize in professionally decorated cakes.  Kay says that overly decorated cakes are compensating for their bad taste and Pete’s family agrees.

We had a BBQ Monday for Memorial Day and everyone made their treats.  Kay decided to bring cake pops. She posted them on her Instagram the night before.  So, and I know this immature, I made the exact same ones she did, same flavor and design. 

We got there and everyone asked where my treats were.  I said they’re in car and I’ll get them in a minute.  So I waited for everyone to be outside then I brought mine in and put them next to Kay’s.

After we eat, I notice the family eating my cake pops and not Kay’s.  She didn’t notice at first and then asked if they weren’t feeling cake pops.  They said they just ate them and they were the best she ever made and asked what she did different.  MIL even said they looked so much better in person than in the picture.

Kay was confused and said hers were still on the table.  That’s when I said, “Oh, I brought those.  Glad you enjoyed them.”

Her husband said he hadn’t had one yet (lies, he ate two) and everyone else just said “yeah, they were okay.”  Kay didn’t say anything the rest of the night.

Pete thought it was funny (he didn’t know what I did until the reveal) but his brother (Kay’s husband) said yesterday that what I did was mean and I’m just mad that Kay is a better baker.  But Pete said it’s ridiculous the family, including Kay, puts down my baking when they won’t even try it all because I’m not Kay. AITA?

ETA:  We aren’t the only two who bring desserts, just the ones who tend to bake cake more than others.  Everyone else’s desserts get eaten to some degree except mine.

Edit 2:  If it’s not clear, “everyone” includes Kay.  She has often tried to “teach” me techniques that I either already knew or were completely wrong.

WIBTA If I didn’t go to my brother’s wedding over a bridesmaid dress?,"I’m currently in medical school and live across the country from my brother/family. I was surprised when his fiancé asked me to be a bridesmaid because I barely know her, but she wants to have all siblings in the wedding. I made it clear that their wedding was during my final exam week, and while I was able to get an accommodation to take my last two exams early I still wouldn’t be able to help much with planning or be present at things like a bachelorette party/bridal shower. She said this was fine, it would mostly just be to have an even number of bridesmaids to groomsmen and for pictures.

There’s a group chat that was created months ago that I would read through every couple of days to get updates on things I needed to do, namely to order a bridesmaid dress. Links were sent with three styles to choose from and we would be updated on colors later. So a couple weeks go by and I ask what color to order, bride says she still thinking about it. Couple more weeks go by and she's still thinking… then a couple more weeks. You get the idea. Now it’s at the point that if I don’t order this dress in a couple of days it won’t be here in time. So I ask on Saturday what color. No response in the group chat to me.

I asked again yesterday (Sunday) what color do I need to order? Then I’m flooded with messages lambasting me for not ordering a dress yet, from her sisters and my sister and her. My sister called me, told me to “get my sh\*t together” and “order a dress already” because my lack of preparedness is causing the bride intense anxiety because she doesn’t think my dress will be here on time for the wedding now. She texted me this morning, “don’t forget order your dress, love you” with smiling and kissing emojis.

Still, no one has told me what color! I’ve scoured the group chat for a mention of dress colors or an image of a dress but only the maid of honor sent a photo of her dress and I don’t know if she has a special color. There’s thousands of messages so it’s not simple to find anything. Everyone else can meet in person so I assume the decision on color was relayed in person. I can’t tell if I’m being purposefully excluded?

About an hour ago my brother called me pleading with me to work things out with the bride because she’s panicking about me. I tried to explain this to him and he told me he doesn’t care, its a petty ladies issue, and since I’m not there for anything else this is the least I can do because the bride thinks I don’t like her because I wouldn’t come to anything. He’s taking her side. They know I’m in medical school, I have literally no say in my schedule. And I’m on the other side of the country, 5.5 hours by plane.

I’m fed up with them and contemplating telling my instructors the wedding was moved and I will take my exams at the regular time. I’d have more time to study that way anyway. I haven’t told anyone in my family I’m considering this. WIBTA?

UPDATE: I called my mother and asked her what color the bridesmaid dresses are, she said lavender. The only color option on the website that I would call lavender are named pearly lilac, periwinkle, and orchid purple. I texted the maid of honor (bride’s sister) to ask what dress color and got a multi-paragraph long lecture about not having ordered my dress yet. Basically, they are trying so hard to accommodate me being across the country by including me in the group chat. She said she didn’t remember the shade name but its a “dusty purple” then sent a blurry picture of a wrinkled order confirmation, the shade name was “mulberry.” On the dress website that is a darker wine/purple color. I told her this and she said to order the lighter dusty purple color.

I sent her a screen shot with the list of shade names and asked, “which of these?” She said she didn’t know because everyone ordered their dress so long ago and asked for pictures of the dresses in different shades from the website. So I sent screenshots of all the light purple colors. No response for a while so I called her on the phone, which she was upset about because its past 10pm over there now. Her response was “look, I don’t care what your problem is with me and my sister but if you want to stay in good standing with this family you need to get your ducks lined up girly.”

I ignored the lecture/comments and asked: “what color?”

Her response? “Light purple”

Me: “of the three I sent, which one is it?”

Her: “I don’t remember, I’ll have to ask one of the other bridesmaids for her receipt, I’ll get back to you”

I want to bash my head into a wall!

I called my second brother, the one not getting married. He said they’re pulling similar things with him and he feels like he was deliberately given the wrong dates for the bachelor party by the best man (bride’s brother) so that he would miss it. He inadvertently learned about the changed date the morning of and when he asked the best man he told him it must have slipped his mind to tell him. Then joked that he wouldn’t have missed much since he probably won’t enjoy any of the “festivities” anyway. They’ve been making homophobic jokes and comments to him that he’s been ignoring but he thinks they’re trying to get him to back out of the wedding. So if we both back out then there will be an even number of bridesmaids to groomsmen again. Only speculation on our parts of course.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Quick update: I was seriously considering pulling out, but the collective rage here and my fading motivation to study has me thinking… by this point, with how this post took off, I wouldn’t be surprised if they find it at some point so I don’t want to reveal my cards just yet. Thank you to the comments that gave me the idea. I guess I’ll be making an update mid June if it all goes to plan.

FINAL UPDATE

Thanks to some responses, I called the bridal salon and asked what colors were ordered. Four dresses in the color “flint” one in “mulberry.” The MOH was setting me up to believe “mulberry” was the color of ALL the dresses. So, I ordered one in mulberry and one in flint. I only let the MOH know I purchased a ""mulberry"" dress.

I caught a red eye to be there for the rehearsal. They had a room to get ready in the morning and wanted all the dresses stored there. I show up with the mulberry dress. The bride begins crying because it’s “too late to fix it!” She asks if I would be upset if asked to drop out because mulberry is for the MOH.

I pretended like I had made such a big mistake! I said, “I know a girl that works at the salon. Let me call her and see if there’s anyway to make it right, and if not I’ll step down because I want you to have the perfect day.” I show back up the next morning to start getting ready with the correct dress in tow. “My friend looked in the back for me and they JUST had this returned yesterday, what are the odds! Exact style, color and my size, it’s a sign!”

Silence. Then an awkward, “that’s amazing.”

Now I’ll be honest, I thought the revenge would be that they had to have me and younger brother in the wedding and photos. I couldn’t have planned the next part. They had to explain to the makeup artist there was an additional bridesmaid meaning they planned from the beginning that I wouldn't be in this wedding.

The ceremony went fine. We took photos after.

Then, there were no place settings for me and little bro with the wedding party at the reception since banked on one less bridesmaid and one less groomsman being present. The table was almost not long enough, two chairs had to be thrown on the ends. We didn’t get food Initially because we were actually in the seating plan at other tables so our plates were brought to those place settings. I can tell my brother (groom) seems ticked off at the staff for seemingly not having things set up properly but the bride and best man diverted his attention.

Before he (groom) left he found me and said he asked the MOH why the setting were wrong and he was told I asked to be dropped from the wedding party weeks ago then showed up and demanded to be in the wedding.

I said I didn't ask to be dropped and showed him my phone where she gave me a thumbs up on the dress. He noticed the screenshot was not the dress I was currently wearing so I said I had to last minute switch it out after confusion on the color. He seemed satisfied with that.

They left on their honeymoon, and my brother returned several days early… alone. So, you can guess how that went.",28109,uwbmey,I am confused as to why your own sister can’t tell you what color dress she ordered for herself - isn’t she also a bridesmaid?

AITA for being openly hostile towards my sister and telling on her thus potentially making her husband loose custody of his children?,"I'm not gonna be shy about this. My sister sucks. She is a horrible self slcentered person who thinks she is the main character.
She is not only a horrible person, she is a step monster.

She married this guy... Who is a freaking push over... 3 years ago. He has two children. 10 and 6. My sister constantly complains about them. Saying things like the 6 year old is gross because he sips too loud or has stained clothing. For the love of god.... He is 6. That's what a child is supposed to do. And she is so mean to the 10 year old girl. She acts straight out jealous of her. I've caught her taunting her, that daddy loves my sister more than her. She is horrible.

I have straight up called her out (after trying to talk to her like a million times) . At Christmas she was saying, that I'd be nice to have the kids there and I said ""why... You hate them?"". This was when everything was almost over and she had been bragging to her friends that her husband had spend more on her than on daughter. A fight ensued. My parents reprimanded me but my cousins took my side and called her out, noting every moment that they had witnessed her being horrible. Her husband obviously took her side and said, that she was a wonderful step mother and that the kids love her. To which I said that was a lie, as I had consoled them countless times after they were taunted by my sister. They left and we haven't talked since.

One day I was running errands and run into my step nephews who were with their mother. I had never met her... And honestly she is wonderful. We decided to have some coffee. While the kids were playing, she asked me how her children behaved etc. I said they were wonderful and then I just spilled the beans on my sister. How awful she was. What I've heard her say to the kids, the inaction of her ex husband. By the end she was horrified. She said the kids didn't like her. But she always chucked it up to my sister being the new woman In their fathers life. She said the kids never really said anything even when she asked. I then told her iw as very concerned for the children as my sister had straight up told the 10 year old, that it would be better, if she disappeared from her father's life. Their mother saw red and asked me if I'd be willing to ""testify"". She said that this was unacceptable and she would be taking their father to court again. I said I would recount the events that I witnessed and could ask my cousins who witnessed a lot too. She was very grateful. I asked my cousins who were all willing to recount the events. Word got arround to my parents and by extention my sister. And they have been calling me the biggest asshole on the planet who would betray family on a whim. Am I the asshole?",28107,skkx07,"NTA - those kids are clearly being abused by your sister, and clearly their wellbeing is being neglected by their father.

AITA for banishing my teenage daughter's friend from our house because she made fun of my weight?,"I (37f) have two kids with my husband (41m); a 14-year-old daughter and a 10 year-old son.

Our daughter has always been a little socially awkward to the point that we've had her tested since we suspected her of being on the spectrum. Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert.

However, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night.

So, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; ""Are you enjoying the food?"" She responded ""Yes! \[Your husband\] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman.""

The room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night.

This was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her ""Sure; if she's going to apologize to me."" When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again.

She then went to her father and asked. He said ""sure"" but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: ""\[Daughter's friend\]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go?""

Yes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and myy daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.",27979,ze4qw3,"As a bigger woman myself, YTA. Kids say dumb things.

AITA for calling the police on my fiance?,"Last night my (35M) Fiance (38F) left in the evening to give a friend's son a ride back to his home. She implied she'd be home before 9. She left at around 7:45.

10:15 rolled around and she still wasn't home. I texted and she apologized to me, saying that her friend's son was actually in the next town over (maybe 30 minutes away) and she was coming home now.

11:45 rolled around and she still hadn't come home, so I called her to no answer. Texted her to no response. I was getting very upset

12.30 rolled around and still no response and no answer to my phone calls. I was extremely angry. 

1:30 rolled around and my anger had completely transformed into worry. Not answering my calls and texts not read.

Around 1:45 I called the police. I have always heard that the first 24 hours of someone being missing is the most important, so I didnt want to delay. I asked them to let me know if there had been any traffic accidents involving her car, and the operator told me that they would put out the word and send some cops to check along the route she would travel. I called all the hospitals in the area to check if she has been checked in and I waited outside watching the road for her car for three hours, partially because I didn't want the kids to hear me on the phone with hospitals, and secondly because I was sick with worry.

At 7:00am she came home. She apologized for being out and said she had no excuse. She was driving home and felt tired like she was falling asleep at the wheel, so she pulled over to the side of the road to sleep. When she did that, she found that her brand new phone had stopped working. She says she napped anyway because it was the responsible thing to do, and then came home at 7am to bring the kids to school and get to work on time. 

I immediately called the police and told them that she had come home safely and gave them the case number and told them to stop searching, which they did. 

My fjance brought the kids to school and left for work. I set out to start cleaning (cleaning destresses me sometimes), and I got a call from a policeman asking where she worked. I told him, and asked why, and I was informed that it was their policy to check on the person's wellness after a missing person is found. I asked them to not go by her work but to give her a call instead. He said he couldn't promise. 

My fiance is relatively new to her job. A police officer showed up and asked to speak with her. She is now enraged at me for calling the police and 'sending a cop to her work' and making her look bad. She is saying I overreacted and that she wasn't missing and that I was punishing her for doing the responsible thing and not driving while drowsy. She is saying that she is never going to leave the house again except for work, because she is afraid I'm going to call the cops on her again. 

So did I overreact? Should I have waited two days like she suggests?",27974,y1h40p,"NTA. She said she was on her way home at 10:15  pm and then disappeared until 7 am. Of COURSE you were going to call the police and have them go looking for her. If she’d been in an accident or worse, she would’ve been dead if you’d waited two days to call.

That being said, she’s definitely lying about what happened.

AITA for making my SIL feel like shit about her weight?,"35F and my SIL is 46F. I have 3 children, the oldest being 16M. For my birthday last week my son went out and bought me this swinging hammock chair that I had been wanting for 2 years and it cost him quite a bit of his saved money (which I fully intend to put back in to his bank account so he can continue saving). He was so excited to see me open this gift and couldnt wait to help me set it up. I told him he shouldnt have, that it was a lot of money and his response was ""You never get anything nice. I wanted you to have it."" And it was true. I usually dont get anything for my birthday or Christmases outside of Tupperware or soaps. So it might sound stupid but I have cherished this swing ever since he got it for me, especially where I finally have something nice that's mine. 

My SIL comes over once a week to see all of us and she immediately headed straight for my swing (which my son hooked up on our deck). I told her to please not sit on it and she said ""Is there a weight limit?"" So I told her yes, 250lbs and I even showed her the box to confirm. She was not upset about this. She just said ""That's a bummer, they need to make something capable of holding us big girls"". I simply agreed with her and went about my business. At this point my husband shows up from work.

When I went inside to grab us some drinks her and my husband are talking on the porch and not even 5 minutes later I hear a loud crash and my husband say ""Fuck, are you alright?"" I go out and sure enough she had sat in my swing and the crochet netting around the hook snapped on one side, causing her to fall right on her ass. She is sitting there laughing, gets up and says ""I guess i need to learn to listen."" So I lost it. As I said above, I literally never get anything nice. Never. This is the one thing that I had that was mine and it didnt even take someone a freaking week before they ruined it for me. So I said ""I literally just fucking told you not even 20 minutes ago that it would not hold you and to please not fucking sit in it.""

She is heavy. She knows it. She deliberately sat in your swing even though she knew the weight limit was lower than her weight. As far as I'm concerned, she has pretty much broken it intentionally.

Also, any decent person gets embarrassed when they break something that doesn't belong to them, no matter how it happens. Especially if the owner gets upset about it.

AITA for ruining my brother's date night and having him come pick his 3yo son up after he dropped him off at my house right before my shift?,"

I M32 have a brother M30 (Kevin) who is a single dad to a 3yo, Kevin lives in the same city as me we don't have any family of relatives here just a few friends.



Kevin has a habit of dumping his kid on me at random times to watch while he goes out on dates with women. So far he's gone out for 4 dates while expecting me to watch my nephew. It bothered me because I have work commitments (I'm a nurse) and my schedule can unpredictable, and so he caused me issues at work for dropping his kid off at my house without telling me first.



Last week he did it again, He came over at 6pm and entered my house with my nephew (he had a spare key) while I was showering and left the house immediately. I got out of the shower and was shocked to see my nephew standing there alone. I asked where his dad was and he said he just left. I knew he wanted me to watch my nephew, I called him several times on the phone and he did not pick up. I was so mad and almost freaking out because I was getting late for my shift. I sent him a text telling him to come pick his son up right now or I'd call cops on him for child abandonment. He texted back begging that I suck it up just this time because he had an important date and he couldn't leave in the middle of it. I told him that I was serious and I'd do it and gave him 10 minutes to get home.


He got home looking pissed and started yelling at me for ruining his date and making him leave in the middle of it, just because I couldn't bother skip one damn shift to watch my nephew. I told him I never agreed to watch his son and he made me do it. He said that it was an emergency which made me laugh because calling a date night ""emergency"" is just absurd. Long story short he left with my nephew but hasn't stopped blaming me for spoiling his date and probably causing damage to the relationship between him and his ""potential"" girlfriend.

It's been a week and he's still salty about it demanding I make it to him and call his date and lie to her and tell her some sob story about why he had to leave like that but I said I won't do that.

AITA for cussing at a lady at the park?,"I (14M) recently took my sister (4F) to a park close to my house, she was pretty excited to go because her dad bought her a bicycle and she wanted to try it out

When we arrived there was a lady with her 2 sons and a daughter, I made eye contact with the lady and just smiled and waved at her to be nice. After 15 minutes or so my sister was playing on the swings because she got scared and didn't want to ride the bicycle anymore 

I looked away for a second to say hello to my uncle since he lives close to us and he was passing by and when I turned my head around to check on my sister I saw she was crying and the lady's sons were using my sisters bike, I approached the kids and politely asked them to please leave the bike alone and use theirs (the 3 kids had brought their own bikes) they ignored me and continued to play with the bike. I decided to go up to the lady and ask her if she could talk to her sons, she responded with ""My kids are having fun and yours isn't using the bike so I don't see a problem"" I then responded with ""I'm aware that she isn't using it, but it's her bike and your kids have their bikes so I don't see a reason for them to use hers"" she then started going on about how I have no reason to talk to her like that if I was going around getting girls pregnant, insinuating that my sister was my daughter, at this point I was pissed and didn't want to deal with this lady so I angrily said ""Lady, she's my sister, and I believe I have the right to talk considering I'm not being a little bitch, so I'm going to ask again, are you going to tell your little rats to get off my sisters bike or not"", she then got up and told her kids to get in the car 

Later when I got home I told my mom about it thinking she would see it as a funny story, boy was I wrong, she started going on about how I was so rude to that lady and that I need to learn to respect my elders

"AITA for ""imposing my culture"" even though I thought I was just being nice?","\*\*\*\*\* UPDATE: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tc16mg/update\_aita\_for\_imposing\_my\_culture\_even\_though\_i/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tc16mg/update_aita_for_imposing_my_culture_even_though_i/) \*\*\*\*\*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even though I (23f) am American, my parents are immigrants and therefore I have a different cultural upbringing than most. One thing that was hammered into my head from a young age was to always, *always* bring a small gift when visiting anyone's house. It doesn't matter if it's family or friends or that one person you kind of know but don't really like, bringing something is a must.

My bf (28m) and I have been dating for almost 4 years now and since we both work from home he suggested we make dinner with his parents a weekly thing since we haven't been able to see each other much for obvious reasons. I love his parents, so obviously I agreed! Every week I made sure to bring something small to show my appreciation for them cooking for us (always using my own money); a small bottle of wine, their favorite dessert, some flowers etc. and they always thanked me for it. This has been going on for a few months and absolutely didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until yesterday when my bf and I were preparing to head over.

I'd gotten a cute vase of daffodils since luckily I'd found some in bloom and my bf's mom really loves them, but my bf suddenly got really mad and asked why I kept bringing stuff over every week like his parents were ""a charity case"". Honestly I got super confused and asked him what the problem was and that I've always done this with everyone including his friends since we met. That it was a cultural thing but then he got even madder and told me to stop imposing my culture on everyone and it's weird since I'm white. At that point I didn't feel like going anywhere with him and just gave him the flowers and went for a walk while he drove over to dinner by himself.

After he came home he still had the flowers which he gave to me and told me he was sorry but his parents really were super annoyed with me constantly bringing stuff over like they can't take care of themselves, and later on I got a text from his dad asking me to not come over for dinner anymore. Now my bf's giving me the cold shoulder unless I give his parents a huge apology, but I really, truly don't feel like I'm in the wrong for trying to be nice to them. AITA?

AITA? For blowing up at my husband for lying to me about my sister and her baby leaving when he actually kicked her out?,"
My sister (20) got out of a terrible relationship and moved in with me and my husband and brought her 5 months old son, she's dealing with a handful of issues from ppd to depression. I asked my husband if he'd be okay with her moving in and he said absolutely, not just this but he was the one who picked her/brought her home.


She stayed for 2 weeks and helped around the house, My husband started complaining about the baby crying but a newborn is expected to cry especially at night. He said it causes him stress although I suggested he put on earbuds. He suddenly told me to forget it and so I did.

Last week, I had to go out of town to attend a friend's funeral without my husband, He said he wanted to stay with my sister to make sure she's okay. I returned home the next day and didn't find her or her baby home. My husband said she contacted a friend in another town and wanted to move with them and left that morning, he handed me a letter he claimed was from her. This felt so odd...especially after reading the letter, I called her phone many many times but turned out my husband found it and said she must've left it behind. I was worried I had no means of contacting her to make sure she was okay, I contacted relatives but they knew nothing.

Yesterday, I got a call from an unknown number and it was her, we talked and she told me that she didn't leave on her own but my husband kicked her out after telling her that she was no longer welcome, and she needed to take responsibility for her decisions. I was in shock as she explained that she's not with a friend but at a shelter and she has no money. I waited til he got home and I blew up at him, he admitted he faked the letter an hid her phone then argued that it's his house to and he has a say, but he shouldn't have lied to me about my sister and causing her to be homeless. I he said I was being unfair and wrong to lash out at him for wanting peace in his home. I went upstairs and refused to argue anymore. I told him I'm going to pick her up tomorrow and he said he'd change the locks while I'm gone and I won't be allowed to bring her home. I'm thinking of going to a hotel but he kept saying that I'm letting my sister affect our lives by prioritizing her but there's a baby involved, my nephew and I can't leave him homeless. I get that it's house too but I don't see why he's so against her staying.


Edit:- he returned home and we started arguing again, I couldn't take it anymore I'm going to stay at a hotel for tonight am I'm leaving in an hour or so. He is wanting to talk again now but I'm incredibly overwhelmed and stressed out and need some time by myself. I don't care if he's going to change the locks or not I'm working on meeting up with my sister as soon as possible so we can talk more openly about what happened and hopefully try and figure something out.",27380,tew2yr,Nta.

AITA for “ruining” my sister in law’s honeymoon by exposing her racism?,"Throw away account although my sister in law will probably recognize the story anyway so I don’t know why I even bother. I don’t think what I did was an AH move at all but maybe the timing was a bit off but No, I don’t think I’m an AH full stop


My (f27) sister in law (f30) got married last weekend. She’s my long term boyfriend’s (m32) sister. They’re white and I’m Middle Eastern. And a dark one with raven black hair. She was looking for a photographer that didn’t bankrupt her so I suggested a friend of mine who’s new in business and charged less than half because these things cost over € 5k these days. She was excited and I set a group chat with her and my photographer friend. We talked a little and later they met and they started messaging directly to each other. 

The wedding was amazing and everything went smoothly. I was one of the guests and she seemed happy. The next day they went off to their honeymoon. I don’t know if it was by mistake but instead of texting the photographer directly like she’s done for the past few months she texted him to our old iMessage chat. She thanked him but had a favor to ask him and wondered wether he could retouch some asymmetry in the (flowers archway? I’m sorry I don’t know the right terms in English) but also if he could take me off some photos because I’m too dark and ruined the color palette. Not all pictures. Just the ones she’s in. 

I texted back are you kidding me?

She didn’t answer. I took a screenshot and posted it on my insta story tagging her in it. She called my bf crying her eyes out calling me an ah for embarrassing her and ruining her honeymoon. Bf thought it was a low blow. I was blinded with rage when I did it but even now I’m calm I still don’t feel that I was an AH. But people have been contacting her apparently asking if she really wrote this. She’s so beautiful and successful so please don’t blame it on jealousy or scare of being outshined.

#**edit for a little update**

[update](https://www.reddit.com/user/Throwwaaway22/comments/w220ia/update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

1) Sister in law is still on her honeymoon so I haven’t talked to her yet but she’s bombarding my bf demanding that I apologize and make a new insta story with my apology. More people got involved including my Bf’s mother that thought I was way out of line ruining her daughters wedding. I have also got contacted by my sister in law’s friends, some of them told me stories about what she’s been talking about me behind my back. Yeah she got what she deserved. The amount of her friends that weren’t surprised at all with her text made it clear for me that I wasn’t wrong.

My sister in law is self employed with some foreign customers thats why she’s taking it so hard because she’s scared that would affect her career. I don’t feel like I need to save her career should something bad happen to it.


2) My photographer friend did what he was told. Thats the only right way imo. Being professional and not confuse work with his own values. He asked me if I wanted him to say something and I said no. I also asked him not to tell me what they’re texting since she’s his client so he shouldn’t break confidentiality. He’s just starting his career and he will meet worse brides. She was at least nice to him throughout their interaction.


3) now to my bf. As I said he thought this whole thing was uncomfortable. I told him if he wanted to be with me he needed to discuss uncomfortable topics. He opened up and it was actually deeper than this. This has happened before. His uncle is very rich and for his 60th birthday he had a very big party. As a thank you we received thank you cards with our pictures on it professionally taken. I remember this picture because his uncle had a “red carpet” moment when guests were photographed upon their arrival. Later we went to my bf’s mother to see the rest of the photos and I wasn’t in any of them. I thought it was funny how I literally evaded being caught on camera. I never mentioned this or even reflected on it and while my bf and his family were looking at the pictures and discussing the evening it was just so normal and no one mentioned something out of the ordinary. Today he told me that I was photoshopped off the pictures. Everyone in his family knew it but me. At the time they just thought the uncle could choose whoever he wanted to have in his pictures and they moved on

-but you all kept it from me 

-yes

-so you must’ve thought it was hurtful 

-i did, I asked my family not to tell you

-and we continued going to that uncle. Celebrated some Christmases, Easters and vacations with him?


Silence

-you didn’t feel offended on my behalf?

Silence 

-and now you think it’s okay that your sister is doing the same?

-I didn’t think of it that way I know my sister. She nit a racist.

-if it wasn’t racist why is she feeling “embarrassed” now? 

Silence 


-you think what she did was alright?


-of course not!


-will you just stand and watch when this happens to our children 


-OF COURSE NOT.


I know my bf very well. He’s very kind and I never felt he was racist in anyway. I know he’s not stupid and is aware of these things which makes it worse because it just means he doesn’t care enough. I asked him why he didn’t care enough and he said he was so sorry but he knows me to be a strong girl that never let these petty things affect her. He’s right, I normally ignore 99% of the racism and micro aggressions I face in life and even laugh at the ignorance. We even discussed this before. But does being strong mean that people are entitled to try to hurt me? Because I usually don’t let them? Does it mean I wouldn’t appreciate to feel the support of my bf having my back? Don’t strong women deserve being supported by their loved ones and feeling safe and loved? He couldn’t answer this.

I told him that I never want his sister in my life again or his uncle and probably not his mother either if she still wants me to apologize. I don’t want to surround myself with people like them and especially when I have children and I asked him if he’s willing to live like that. I asked him not to answer me now and think about it. It kinda felt like an ultimatum and thats bad but I didn’t know how to handle the situation better. 

I never thought of myself as someone who’s petty or that makes ultimatums. This experience taught me that I’m both🤷🏽‍♀️

AITA for serving my sister's husband dinner using toy utensils?,"

I, m17, moved in with  you sister after my parents kicked me out for coming out (another story) they said I'll be here temporarily til I get back to ""normal"" which I don't think I will, lol. But uh...anyways, so I moved in with my sister and her husband about a month ago. FYI she does everything around the house (I started helping here and there) as well as looking after a 2 year old niece and now she's 6 months pregnant. BIL does nothing because he's the breadwinner as he claims but imo he's taken it a bit too far. e.g he'd tell her to start his laundry once he takes off his clothes, put dinner on the table once he's home, get the shower ready and so on.


They fight a lot cause my sister is exhausted and burnt out, I usually put my headphones on and mind my own business but 2 nights ago there was a lot of commotion once heart home so I went to see what the issue was. Turns BIL was complaining about dinner and my sister was too exhausted to get up. I mean the dinner was already cooked but he wanted her to put it for him on the table. I told my sister I'd do it, but instead of using their kitchen utensils, I used my niece's toy utensils like toy cup, toy plate, toy fork and knife and a tiny napkin. I put the food on the toy plate and the drink in the toy cup while BIL was in the shower. He then came into the kitchen and sat down and stared at the plate for few seconds. He then looked at me and asked what the he'll this was, and whether I was joking. I told him if he wanted to act like a helpless child, then he might as well get treated like one. He began yelling and my sister came inside. He then threw the napkin and stormed off upon saying that I'd disrespected him and that he'll let my parents know about what I did. My sister saw what I'd done and started laughing. I went inside my room but the argument didn't stop, now he's expecting an apology for me for meddling in his marriage and pulling this crappy stunt on him. I could be TA for this but I was just so mad for my sister and also sick and tired of being sick and tired of the nightly fighting over dinner.",27318,tiy2nc,[removed],5365,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tiy2nc/aita_for_serving_my_sisters_husband_dinner_using/,"['moved', 'sister', 'parents', 'kicked', 'coming', 'another', 'story', 'said', 'ill', 'temporarily', 'til', 'get', 'back', 'normal', 'think', 'lol', 'uhanyways', 'moved', 'sister', 'husband', 'month', 'ago', 'fyi', 'does', 'everything', 'around', 'house', 'started', 'helping', 'well', 'looking', 'year', 'old', 'niece', 'shes', 'months', 'pregnant', 'bil', 'does', 'nothing', 'because', 'hes', 'breadwinner', 'claims', 'imo', 'hes', 'taken', 'bit', 'far', 'eg', 'hed', 'tell', 'start', 'his', 'laundry', 'once', 'takes', 'his', 'clothes', 'put', 'dinner', 'table', 'once', 'hes', 'home', 'get', 'shower', 'ready', 'fight', 'lot', 'cause', 'sister', 'exhausted', 'burnt', 'usually', 'put', 'headphones', 'mind', 'business', 'nights', 'ago', 'was', 'lot', 'commotion', 'once', 'heart', 'home', 'went', 'see', 'issue', 'was', 'turns', 'bil', 'was', 'complaining', 'dinner', 'sister', 'was', 'exhausted', 'get', 'mean', 'dinner', 'was', 'already', 'cooked', 'wanted', 'put', 'table', 'told', 'sister', 'id', 'instead', 'using', 'kitchen', 'utensils', 'used', 'nieces', 'toy', 'utensils', 'like', 'toy', 'cup', 'toy', 'plate', 'toy', 'fork', 'knife', 'tiny', 'napkin', 'put', 'food', 'toy', 'plate', 'drink', 'toy', 'cup', 'bil', 'was', 'shower', 'came', 'kitchen', 'sat', 'stared', 'plate', 'seconds', 'looked', 'asked', 'hell', 'this', 'was', 'whether', 'was', 'joking', 'told', 'wanted', 'act', 'like', 'helpless', 'child', 'might', 'well', 'get', 'treated', 'like', 'one', 'began', 'yelling', 'sister', 'came', 'inside', 'threw', 'napkin', 'stormed', 'upon', 'saying', 'id', 'disrespected', 'hell', 'let', 'parents', 'know', 'sister', 'saw', 'id', 'done', 'started', 'laughing', 'went', 'inside', 'room', 'argument', 'stop', 'hes', 'expecting', 'apology', 'meddling', 'his', 'marriage', 'pulling', 'this', 'crappy', 'stunt', 'could', 'ta', 'this', 'was', 'mad', 'sister', 'also', 'sick', 'tired', 'being', 'sick', 'tired', 'nightly', 'fighting', 'dinner']",moved sister parents kicked coming another story said ill temporarily til get back normal think lol uhanyways moved sister husband month ago fyi does everything around house started helping well looking year old niece shes months pregnant bil does nothing because hes breadwinner claims imo hes taken bit far eg hed tell start his laundry once takes his clothes put dinner table once hes home get shower ready fight lot cause sister exhausted burnt usually put headphones mind business nights ago was lot commotion once heart home went see issue was turns bil was complaining dinner sister was exhausted get mean dinner was already cooked wanted put table told sister id instead using kitchen utensils used nieces toy utensils like toy cup toy plate toy fork knife tiny napkin put food toy plate drink toy cup bil was shower came kitchen sat stared plate seconds looked asked hell this was whether was joking told wanted act like helpless child might well get treated like one began yelling sister came inside threw napkin stormed upon saying id disrespected hell let parents know sister saw id done started laughing went inside room argument stop hes expecting apology meddling his marriage pulling this crappy stunt could ta this was mad sister also sick tired being sick tired nightly fighting dinner 
AITA for telling my son exactly what my husband did despite him begging me not to tell?,"


I have a son (adam 14) from my previous marriage, I'm currently with my husband of 4 yrs. I handle everything related to Adam's school. He has a friend (Dean 14) that he started hanging out with a year ago. Dean is an amazing boy and has been nothing but a great influence for adam. I met Dean's dad (Mike) who's a single dad and we'd see each other daily for school pickup/drop offs. My husband kept asking about Mike and pointed out that he's being boundary stompping but I disagree.

Unfortunately, Adam fell sick months ago and had to undergo a surgery recently. It's been hard but Dean kept visiting, sometimes Mike would come too and my husband would either ignore Mike or make passive comments towards him. Mike picked up on that and I told my husband to knock it off cause his hostility affected Adam and Dean as well.


Days ago, I found Adam crying in his room, this was weeks after getting discharged, I asked and he said that Dean sent him a text telling him they were no longer friends and blocked his number. I was confused they were fine. I wanted to go talk to Dean but the next day I found his phone in my husband's car. I confronted him and he said he ""borrowed"" it from Dean but I didn't buy it. After pushing he confessed that he stole Dean's phone at the hospital and sent Adam a text telling him to not contact him again. I asked why and he said it was all Mike's fault for being too close to me and acting inappropriately, and said that he didn't want to directly tell Adam to no longer speak to Dean and chose this stratagy to not make Adam hate him while keeping Dean and by extention Mike away. This hit a nerve so hard I started screaming at him. He said he already expressed how uncomfertable he felt with Mike being around and I kept brushing it off. I said it was because of how ridiculous his argument was, Mike has been nothing but respectable and helpful, I yelled calling him insecure and unreasonable and also cruel for causing Adam heartache with his stunt. He begged I don't tell Adam but I took the phone and returned it to dean and exlained to him and Adam what happened.


Adam is no longer speaking to my husband and he is blaming me for telling instead of keeping it between the adults like I'm supposed to.",27195,tu41gf,"NTA. i don't care what mike was doing. i don't care what you were doing. he said he wanted it to 'stay between the adults', and yeah, it should have, but you didn't bring the kids into it, he did, because he STOLE A CHILD'S PHONE TO MANIPULATE YOUR CHILD. 

he STOLE from a child so that he could manipulate and lie to your child. he tried to ruin THEIR friendship instead of nutting the fuck up and being a man and trying to find a compromise, trying to actually communicate instead of passive-aggressively being a dick to mike and you, literally anything that didn't involve trying to destroy a friendship between two children, one of whom was recovering from a fucking surgery.

AITA for cancelling the family trip after I found out that my wife cancelled my son's ticket?,"Situation is a bit messy so bear with me.



I M42 have two boys, Adam 16 & Leo 14. Their mom passed away 5 years ago and I married my wife Rose about a year ago. Rose adores both of my boys but complains about Leo being overly uptight and closed up. It's true that he likes to keep to himself, doesn't participate in most family functions but that's just how he is. My wife has taken it personally and kept saying that Leo clearly doesn't like her and/or doesn't like spending time with her.

What she started doing was try to exclude him from events under the excuse of ""he wouldn't be I interested anyway"" which I thought was wrong because he's picked up on that and started asking why. So I told my wife to just do herpart and that giving him the choice to decide whether he wants to participate or not and not outright exclude him.


I'd been arranging for a family trip and days ago I booked tickets/hotel reservation upon deciding our destination. Note that I was paying for the entire thing. But the day of the trip I found out that Leo's ticket had been cancelled, I was dumbfounded to discover it was my wife who cancelled it, I immediately confronted her and she said she figured Leo wouldn't want to come but she knew he said he'd go, she tried to argue that due to his ""moody personality and introvert nature"" he'd change his mind last minute or go on thd trip but turn it into a miserable experience for us all. I got so mad at her especially after she tried pressuring me to leave him with his aunt. I cance.led the entire trip, all tickets, all reservations everything. She blew up at me and started lashing out. I had the boys unpack and I did the same which made her go crazy and yell at everyone in the house. She went to stay with her sister while exposing what I did to the rest of the family who thought I made a big deal out of it and should've cancelled the trip that I promised the while family.


1#Edit. format and mistakes, I'm so sorry for those.

2#Edit. I am planning another trip with the boys (without my wife) but right now there's huge conflict in the family and even Adam is upset and blames Leo for what happened. I'm trying to get everyone to calm down then we'll see where this goes.

3#Edit. I've decided (and following some opinions here) to speak to Adam to see exactly why he blames Leo for what happened. He just got home and I'm about to get him into a seperate room for a private talk to be able to hear his side in this and find out why he feels this way. If there's any relevant information I will add it below.

4#Edit. I spoke with Adam. Turns out, Rose told him I cancelled the trip after Leo changed his mind ""last minute"" and that I decided to cancel it for everyone else and fought with her when she tried to convince me to go anyway and let Leo go stay with his aunt. This is just....I don't know what to say to be frankly honest. Adam didn't even want to talk but I told him we needed to talk. He and Leo aren't speaking right now because of this and I'm struggling trying to clean up this mess. I was actually thinking about calling Rose but after this I've decided I need more space than she does. I will have the boys sit together (it's hard to do it but I'll try) and talk this put so I can focus on the other major issue I have with what Rose did.",27189,vpox9w,"NTA.  Your wife cancelled your son's reservation because she didn't want to go on vacation with him.  Your son is 14.  He lost his mother and then had to adjust to you getting remarried.

AITA for losing it and telling in-laws to stop calling me “mama” and trying to erase my identity?,"I have 2 kids, 2f, 4f. I fucking hate how everyone thinks of me as being just a mommy now. I don’t get to be my own person. I’m just mommy.

Husband doesn’t face this. He gets gifts from everyone that have to do with his hobbies. Me? I get a bunch of mommy shit. Tee hee, mommy needs wine! 

And like matching outfits. I don’t mean like, one of those cutesy matching pajama sets that the nurses and horse girls wear in their staged Christmas insta pics. I mean like, people actually think I’m going to go out in public wearing some cutesy matching outfits with my toddlers. As though I think they’re mini versions of myself? Or dolls?

From the time we got to the in-laws, it was “mama” this and “mama” that. At some point, my SIL said it and I said “You know my name is (Carmen), right?” she just looked at me funny and said “Of course, silly?” I said “So why do you keep calling me “mama”? You aren’t going around calling (husband) papa?” SIL just looked at me like I had 2 heads and was like “Um, okay.” 

This went on all over Christmas. Here you go, mama. Want another slice, mama? 

At that point I was just like “Do you guys mind calling me by my name instead of calling me mama?”

The same SIL as before did the whole golly-gee doe eyed thing and said “But you’re such a good mama!”

I said that I’m not JUST a mom. I gestured to the things that husband got for Christmas from them, and said “Why didn’t you guys get him anything that says  “papa”? Everything you gave me is somehow related to me being a mom. Why does HE get to be his own person?”

MIL grabbed my hand and squeezed it and said that she was sorry that she made me feel like this. She was just “so excited” about being a grandma and she never really thought of things like that.

I was feeling a little better until SIL2 and SIL3 started going after me. One of them did that whole “Are you okay? Do you need to talk someone? You sound so angry, it isn’t healthy” faux concern thing that’s meant to shame you for having any emotional response.

The other one was angry and saying that “is being a mom somehow beneath you” and “do you think you’re better than the rest of us?” and all that.

When we finally left, he asked me why I’d kept it in for so long, and I said that I haven’t. No one listened to me before. I’ve said these things plenty of times. I’ve always asked them to call me by my name and not some disgusting nickname that boils me down to giving birth. He nodded, but said that I’d put a big pallor on the weekend and that I need to apologize for the outburst at some point.

I said sure, as soon as SILs apologize to me for dehumanizing me for years. 

We’re at a stalemate. AITA?",27181,zwkcst,"NTA. Your MIL reacted appropriately imo saying she didn’t realize and had no ill intent (which I believe).

AITA for not telling my cousin my fiance works at the same office as her husband?,"First/only post, I mainly lurk. I thought stuff like this only happened in movies, but it happened and would like some unbiased opinions. More light-hearted than some of the other posts on here.

I have a cousin 'Kat', who got married to 'Henry' early this year. We weren't close as kids - she was pretty spoilt and would always brag about how much designer stuff she has, be really mean to people under the guise of ""just trying to help"", etc. Don't go out of our way to interact with one another but I do see her at family events and whatnot and we make small talk. 

I'm engaged to 'Chris', who is a software engineer. He's co-head of his department at work with two other people - not too long ago, Chris was telling me about how they had some new employees and one of them sounded really familiar, he told me the name and I realized it was Kat's husband. (Also he and Henry hadn't met face-to-face yet)

Kat and Henry had a huge wedding, it was really nice but all she did for months is brag about how amazing her wedding was. The wedding stuff's died down now so recently she's started going on about how wealthy her husband is and what a great lifestyle they have. One of my other aunts celebrated her 50th about a week ago, I went with Chris and Kat was there with Henry. We were chatting and Kat was saying how Henry has a fantastic new job that pays even more than his previous one. Henry chimed in and said that they were already planning to buy a new house. Kat asked what Chris does. I said he was an engineer like Henry and he has a good job too, but I'll admit I left out where he works on purpose. She smiled and nodded, then said it's fine, she understands that I'm embarrassed and want to keep it quiet. So that was pretty much the end of our conversation then - when we were leaving, she pulled me aside and told me to ""let her and Henry know if we needed help with the wedding"". Obviously I knew what she meant and it was just another dig, but I said bye and left.

Literally two days later, I get a dm from Kat and she's furious (well, as much as one can be through text) that I didn't tell them that Chris was one of Henry's bosses. Henry was shocked to see him in the office and Chris made a comment ""tell Kat -OP- and me don't need help but thanks for offering"". Henry's really embarrassed and so's Kat, and she said that we made them look bad on purpose and if she knew, she'd have never made those comments. It was my ""duty"" to tell her and Henry. Chris and I had a really good laugh over this, but she sent a text out to the family group chat we have saying how she was ""blindsided"" by me. A few others said that what we did was petty and wrong. So, AITA?",27100,v6t4aq,"NTA

Kat is embarrassed and also annoyed she can’t brag and one up you so she’s telling you off as a way to clambour back power over you. Stand your ground and don’t apologise. You can say “I understand you’re embarrassed but I didn’t do anything wrong. If you didn’t talk down to people this would never be an issue”. Ignore all the whinging and people she enlists to complain on her behalf.

AITA for not waking my husband up for his 5AM walk?,"
So for the past month, my (36) husband (39) has waking up at 5 every night to have a walk. These walks would take about 2 hours, Side note to mention that this new, he's not trying to lose weight (pretty thin) he's not athletic by nature nor has sports interests or hobbies. infact, he hated doing any type of sport.

I'm happy for him since it's an overall positive thing. but yesterday, he came home in the evening after working for long hours then stayed up late playing with his phone. I went to bed at 10 after getting done with the mess and everything.

I woke up by him yelling at me at 7 am asking me why I didn't wake him up for his 5am walk. He said he missed it and I'm responsible for that. I was so confused I said that first of all, he always wakes up by setting his alarm, why should I be expected to wake him up this time. He yelled that he forgot to set his alarm. I said so what? it's no big deal it's not like....he missed an important meaning or something but he got more angry and said that those walks help imrove his health and restore his energy and help him feel better. I made a comment about how missing one walk won't hurt but he unloaded on yelling about how I was trying to prevent him for doing his hobby for some unknown reason. I told him he was sorely mistaken even though I admit that those daily 5am walks around the veteran's park are weird but also his reaction? I really thought it was over the top. He stormed off and went to shower saying I ruined his entire day.

When he got out he started avoiding and ignoring me. Even when I talk to him directly. he went to work and refused to respond to my calls.

Really, I'm at a loss like maybe it was something I said about his walks. but I really don't know. he's sulking nonstop as of now and I'm literally about to lose my mind.

AITA For tricking my parents into being on time for my wedding.,"My (M33) parents are late for everything. Like everything. Both of my sister's and myself have been disappointed so many times.  

Graduation ceremonies, birthday parties, even my father's retirement dinner.  It is completely my mother's fault.  She is a wonderful mother and I love her dearly, she just does not understand the concept of punctuality.  

I have seen her talking to her sister on the phone and reminded her she needed to be at my baby sister's dance recital.  She waved me off and arrived after my sister had danced.  

We are all used to it.  My dad is just done trying to get her to be on time for anything. 

My now wife (F28) told me in no uncertain terms that if my mother was late for our wedding she would do terrible things to me.  She was only half joking.  But she was a witness to my mom and dad arriving halfway through my cousin's quinceañera.  

So here is what I did.  It is completely on me. Me wife was not involved. If there is a dick move it was completely mine. 

When we were getting samples for the wedding I talked to the printer and had one special invitation printed with the time on it stated s being one hour earlier than the actual start time of the ceremony.  

My mother was beside herself apparently when they left the house and thought they were going to miss the wedding since she was a part of it with her and my MIL lighting the candles we would use to light the unity candle and stuff.  

When she arrived and noticed other people were also just arriving and parking she was so relieved that we were starting late that she just went with it.  

The ceremony went off beautifully. And so did the wedding pictures and the reception. 

The problem came last Sunday. My parents came over for a big family dinner and we didn't bother starting the grill until they showed up.  She asked why everyone wasn't eating and we just said we knew we would be waiting for them since they are always late.  

She said that she was not always late and had been on time for my wedding.  She hadn't been. They arrived 45 minutes AFTER the time on their invitation.  

My idiot cousin John, real name because it's common and he deserves people to know he is a dolt, snorted at her statement.  A few other people giggled or smiled at this and she picked up and asked what was so funny.  

I came clean and told her about the ""special"" invitation.  

She is pissed at me for not trusting her and making her look foolish in front of everyone.  If my cousin had just controlled himself she never would have known.  

AITA,?

Edit

Part of the reason she is mad is because she had her invitation framed.  To be honest I was already planning a heist with my sisters to replace it with the real one in case she ever noticed the discrepancy between hers and the one we have framed in our home.

Edit number two. 

Yeah we are Latinos.  And no I do not in any way consider it racist how many of you guessed that.  I have been to Spain and it's an issue there too.  And the Philippines. Basically anywhere those guys were in charge.

Edit three.  

Stop defending John. He and I have spent thirty years messing with each other.  I have an AITA story that ends with me getting an offensive tattoo ($5,000 for removal) and him getting a body cavity search at the Mexican border.

AITA for being livid at my (now) husband?,"My (33F) husband (30M) and I got married last week.  I had been super chill throughout the whole wedding planning, and during the actual event.  Because I know sh\*t happens and if anything goes wrong, or not exactly how we wanted, it's not that big of a deal and may even make the wedding more memorable for the guests.  The one thing that I told my husband I didn't want to happen was I didn't want him smashing cake in my face.  I had a suspicion that he would find it funny to do it, so during the planning, I flat out told him not to do it.  I don't think it's funny, I don't want to mess up my makeup that took hours to apply, and I don't want cake on my expensive wedding dress.  I told him I would be livid if he did it.  He promised that he wouldn't.

Well, come the cake cutting time, what did he do?  Smashed the cake in my face!  It got on my dress, and messed up my makeup, just like I knew it would.  I'm pretty sure his friends convinced him to do it, not that that makes it any better.  I kept it together, went and cleaned myself up, and put on a smile for the rest of the reception.  But afterwards, I let loose on him.  I yelled at him that this was the ONE THING I asked him not to do, and he promised that he wouldn't.  He told me I was being dramatic, that it's not a big deal, and we should just be enjoying our time as newlyweds.  So was I being overly dramatic?  AITA?",26824,uwpjcd,"What worries me isn't that he did the cake smashing itself. 

It is his response back to you.

He should have apologized and listened to you, and really realized his mistake. Instead, he diminished your very valid feelings and reasons.

AITA for screenshotting messages guys sent me and sending them to their mothers?,"I'm an 18 year old girl who is in college atm. I've been getting bullied/harassed by three guys in my class who have taken to messaging me online with rather gross/harassing messages and nsfw pictures that i'm sure you can all fill in the gaps without me going into detail. I should have reported them or just blocked them but I had, had enough so I screenshot every message they'd sent me and found their mothers through their facebook pages and sent screenshots to them including an explanation of who I am and how their sons have been bothering me.

Their mothers were horrified and shocked by what I sent them explaining what was going on and all three are on my side. Some of my friends think this is genius and exactly what they deserved but some of my other friends think I took it too far and it was out of line to put that on their Mothers and also how I don't know what their home life is like. 

Am I the asshole for doing this? Should I have gone about it another way?

Edit due to questions/comments: When it was just standard bullying I reported them but they only got a warning, the messages/pictures started after that as if to prove I couldn't do anything. I figured reporting them again wouldn't work so did this.

"AITA for ""forcing"" my father to pay child support","My father is a dick. When he got my mother pregnant he wanted her to quit her job and just stay home to ""be a good little wife and mother.  He is very well off due to a trust fund and he doesn't really need to work.  My mother refused and divorced him. Because of a prenup she got very little and he moved back to Europe. His parents never knew about me and my mother had a good profession and I never really wanted for anything. My grandmother and grandfather, her mom and dad were awesome, and I got to spend my summers exploring the wilds of Western Canada with them. My father never paid the child support he should have. Like I said it did really matter. My mom makes good money and she gave me a great life as a child.  

So the point of this post.    I'm (F28) getting married.  I met the love of my life (M31) at university and we have been together for eight years.  He is a wonderful person and he really is my lobster. (Sorry, Friends reference). 
His family is from the same city as my father and they are a huge rambunctious bunch. Because of a lot of intermingled business and personal relationships my parental grandparents found out about my impending wedding and me I suppose. The have been in contact and want to come to Canada to meet me and my fiancee who I guess is a grandson of an acquaintance of theirs.  Small world. 

When they found out that my father had basically abandoned me to fend for myself in this world, this is honestly how they see it, they were pissed to say the least. It is very funny because we are decidedly upper middle class here.

So long story short they had their lawyer calculate the amount of child support my father should have paid with inyerest and the cost of my post secondary education. They then gave my this as a gift.  What I didn't know was that it came out of my father's yearly draw on his trust fund.  

He is furious because it is obviously a sizeable amount and it will very much affect his finances for at least the next two years.  He may need to ,GASP, get a job.  

He has been contacting me and telling me that his current wife and children will be negatively affected if I don't give him back this money.  

I don't really need it. And I guess I am entitled to it and I am getting a trust fund now as well.  

But I really want to pay off any debt my mother may have and make sure that when she retires she can do whatever suits her fancy. 

I'm not giving it back. 

AITA?

Edit: to answer some common questions. 

1. My half siblings will not really be affected. They have trust funds set up already and their tuitions and fees and stuff are covered. 

2. My grandparents family sets these up when ba kid is born.  One of the reasons my father is upset is because since he didn't bother to tell his parents about me they did not set this up.  They have since taken a good chunk of his trust fund and used it to set mine up. Realistically the principle being separated 28 years ago would have left him in the exact same position. 

3. My mom was working on getting her PhD so she could help kids with a certain condition.  That is what he wanted her to walk away from. 

4. My grandparents have sent me pictures of my family there. The coolest thing is that my grandfather looks like the granddad from The Parent Trap.

5. My mom never remarried. But she has had a special friend since I was five.  He is amazing and taught me to swear in Colombian Spanish.

Edit número dos.

I just had lunch with my mom. Apparently she has no debt. Like at all.  I guess she did literally write the book about the treatment for the kids she works with she does okay for herself.  I never really thought about it.  We decided that what would be best is to set up a scholarship for people who want to go into her field of study.  Since I am now a trustafarian I can afford to do this. I am however going to book her and her ""friend"" a trip for after my wedding. And I am going to go pay off my car.

AITA for making my boyfriend feel uncomfortable after he insisted on joining us on girls night in?,"

My boyfriend m/27 started asking to join me in my girls night in. Everytime I tried to say no he be like ""I have to join or you'll have to cancel"". It made me & the girls miserable having to sit there with him in the middle.

This past friday he insisted to join us again, I had enough I came up with an idea to get him to hate hanging out with us, made a plan and told the girls what we were going to do and they were down for ot.


The girls came and my boyfriend immediately sat with us and started ruining our conversations by steering them towards him/his work/his achievement. So here's what I did, I started bringing up gross/ embarrassing subjects and the girls were eating them up by talking about them in details. Subjects like sevx, periods (his most sensitive spot), cramp diarrhea, hairy legs, fart getting trapped in the valva and coming out the front. Squeezing shit out of our faces, cramp diarrhea, dirty underware, and again...cramp diarrhea.

We talked about this stuff in boring details, like...I could feel his discomfert without even looking at him. But God when I turned to see why he got quiet suddenly. he was getting red in the face, and had sweat all over his forehead, I bet he found himself unable to relate to thise subject thus couldn't take part in the conversation.


He got up from the couch ready to head out, I looked at him and asked where he was going and he was like ""I just ah...I just remembered that I have an important meeting with a guy in about 10 minutes and....ah...I have to go now"" he rushed out telling us to have fun. The girls and I started laughing hysterically.


he came home and berated me saying I made him feel uncomfortable/sick with the horrible subjects I kept bringing. I said ""what u talking about? This is the typical stuff girls talk about all the time"" but he insisted I made him upset and caused him to leave. He declined to speak to me and been quiet since then.


AITA?

**UPDATW** Y'all wow, just got home and left this post at 70ish comments, and here I am looking at hundreds of comments but only read a bunch, you guys...thank you so much for your feed back and enlightening advice. Just to add context: this is his apartment, he tells me who is and isn't allowed to come and I thought this was fine since it's his place (though I help with the bills, but he makes so much more as the head of security in his company so that's that) I just can't believe how dense and blind I been to his negative ways. He's still giving me the silent treatment and I've decided it's just a lot to take, and so I'm temporarily moving in with one of the girls and will now be definately reconsidering few things.

Just wanted to keep you guys updated since many of you got engaged in this post, thank you so much for those DMing me their concerns, appreciate your time and concerns.

AITA for high fiving a stranger who “humiliated” my bf?,"My bf and I go to the climbing gym regularly. He is really into it and I just started and climbing a few times a week. He’s stupidly competitive about it and quietly insults beginners who are not as good which makes me feel self conscious because I’m a beginner. 

Last night we were at the climbing gym again and he was doing a V6. There was about 6 people taking turns on the problem probably because it’s a newly installed route and they were all failing. Then a girl came and flashed it. She made it so easy but at the end she didn’t hold the final hold for 5 seconds and my bf called her out after she was done. Holding the last hold for 5 seconds is suppose to be the “right way” of finishing a route but she was doing it so easily she definitely could have. I think he was just being salty because she did it when he couldn’t. She laughed and told him he didn’t even start the problem correctly and walked off. I gave her a high five because she was walking towards me and did amazing at the problem (and knocked my bf off his high horse) and she was surprised but high fived me. 

My bf turned to me and gave me a wtf look and wouldn’t talk to me the rest of the night. When we were heading home he ranted that I couldn’t be trusted to watch his back if I chose to take a stranger’s side over him. I was shocked that’s what he took from the climb and told him she shouldn’t have nitpicked her when she clearly climbed it correctly and he got mad and argued I was suppose to take his side over people I don’t even know.",26839,10bvopw,NTA.

AITA for going to a different hotel during my vacation with my husband?,"It our first real vacation since 2020 and my first with just my husband and in over 10 years. 

Our daughter Annie (17) was left home alone. For some reason recently Annie can do no right in hubby’s eyes. Dress, music, chores. He has deemed her irresponsible. It farthest from the truth. She has a summer job and makes good grades. She’s in-fact kinda a hermit for her age. 

Unknown to me my husband set the hot water heater to refill only once a day while we are gone. Annie did some dishes and laundry. She took a shower and the water was cold. She was upset and thought it broke and called us panicking. 

My husband yelled into her for wasting our hot water and telling her how irresponsible she was enough to make her cry. 

I got madder than I ever have in this marriage and basically said most parents would love to have a 17 year old like Annie. We argued and screamed all night so next day I left the resort to a little hotel down the street. My husband as been trying to call me and I told Annie to block her father and don’t pay attention to him.

My husband is mad about the wasted money on this vacation but I can’t stand to even look at him over an argument over something so stupid and preventable.",26733,w8qkbc,"NTA.

Let me get this straight... your husband is mad because the daughter who was home alone washed dishes, did laundry, and took a shower? My mom would have jumped up and down if I washed dishes and did laundry as a 17 yr old home alone. That's fucking nuts.

AITA for calling the Police on my husband after I found that he was hiding my son's motorcycle?,"
I got my son a 7k motorcycle for his 18th birthday this past june. My son is obssessed with automobile and loves motorcycles. In his room he has plenty of models and posters of motorcylces of all types. His bio dad passed away when he was just 12, now I'm married to my current husband and he has kids of his own.


My husband has always been against my son's interest in motorcycles. he thinks I'm encouraging him to be reckless, distracting him from school and by extension his future, and spoiling him and blowing away money by spending 7k on a motorcycle. This caused some tension between him and my son so I told him to stop complaining about it.


Around 2 weeks ago, my son's motorcycle went missing. We opened a police report but nothing came out of it. it just disappeared. My husband had a smirk on his face the entire time just walking around saying ""I told you so!, you just wasted your money!"". This was unbbearablr to hear to be quite honest.


My mother inlaw visited few days ago. She was talking about the other house my husband owns and mentioned seeing a motorcycle, one that's similar to the one that we lost in my husband's carage while she was cleaning it (she goes to clean that house weekly even though it's empty, my husband plans on giving it to his kids as inheritance). I was puzzled I asked if she was certain but she showed me a photo she took of it which confirmed that it was indeed my son's motorcycle. I immedietly rushed to call my husband and confront him about it. He admitted that he took and hid the motorcycle in his garage as a last resort after me and his stepson kept brushing him and his thoughts off about the 7k being spent on something unnecesary and that could cause issues.

I blew up at him demanding he return it, he refused and told me he had been considering selling it and giving the money back to me so ""I could use it wisely this time"". I told him I was serious and that I'd call the police. He literally said ""this is a family matter and cops can't do shit about it"". I had enough I called the cops soon as I ended the call with him.


The motorcycle was found and returned, but my husband had to be taken in since there was an open file about the motorcylce going missing. he was let go eventually but he was livid with me. He came home yelling about how awful what I did was and how crazy my behavior was. I refused to engage in the argument but he told his entire family about it and they judged me for calling the police on my own husband even though I already asked him to return it. he said he was just looking out for my son and that one day we'll realize that he was right but only when it's too late.

My son isn't spsaking to me or my husband.

AITA for making sexy poses while neighbor kept recording me for no reason?,"My dad passed away recently and he left me (26M) and my sister (31f) his house. It’s super unkempt so I’ve been doing lots of yard work outside in the mornings. I’m out there watering the grass in the mornings and evenings. Every single time I’ve done this the neighbor right next door who’s like this older granny comes out to her porch and straight up watches me without even hiding it. I introduced myself to her once that me and my sister are the new owners after my dad passed but it was obvious she didn’t wanna talk. 

Next thing she started coming outside with her *phone* pointing the camera right at me. I’m like “ is there a problem?” She says there’s no problem as long as I’m doing what I’m supposed to. I asked her why is she recording me then. Neighbor lady goes what’s the problem with me recording if you’re not doing anything wrong. It’s so fucking weird I didn’t even know how to respond to the situation. 

Soon as I finished up to go back inside she went back to her house too. This happens every. single. day I’m outside watering the grass. Always the same excuse that she wants to make sure I’m not doing anything else or if I do it’s on camera. So yesterday I got fed up and decided to do something different. When she came out with her phone I stuck my ass out and put my hand on my hip looking right at her. 

At first she was like wtf but then she got really mad when I started wetting myself with the water hose an touching my neck while literally looking directly at her. Was it stupid? 

Yes but she put her phone away and started cussing me out for being a pervert. My sister told me later on that she came to the house when I was at work talking about me sexually harassing her making poses in provocative ways. My sister knows she’s a pain in the ass since she probably has nothing better to do with her time. 

But I still shouldn’t have stooped to her level making her uncomfortable right back.

AITA for installing a lock on the bathroom door after my BIL kept barging in?,"
My f25 husband's m30, brother (BIL) m33 moved in with us after his divorce few weeks ago. The problem I have is that he started barging in to the bathroom whenever I'm using it. He never knocks or anything. Another thing is that he only does this when it's me in the bathroom not his brother. I told my husband about what I'd noticed but he laughed it off and called me paranoid. It was embarrassing because his brother would see me exposed and it made me uncomfortable. My husband said he spoke to him and he apologized but did it again.


When my husband and I got married, we promised to not have locks or lock each other out of any room. So the bathroom didn't have a lock. I was really considering getting a lock and I let my husband know that if his brother walks in on me in the bathroom one more time then a lock will instantly be installed. He didn't say anything.


Well, Yesterday, BIL walked in on me showering. He knew I would be in the shower but barged in anyone claming he needed to pee. I had enough I went out and got a lock and installed it. My husband got home, saw it and blew up on me saying I voilated an agreement that I was part of"" and went against his wishes being uncomfortable with locks in the house. He demanded I remove it and *promised* and *guarenteed* that his brother won't walk in on me again but I refused. 

He's been pissed about it since then and is giving the silence treatement.


INFO I'm not close with my BIL, my husband is. I don't even talk to him that much and I barely even sat with him at any gathering before he moved in with us.





UPATDATE: So before I provide an update on this situation. It's worth noting that my BIL used to do this with the bedroom too but at least I'm not always exposed in the bedroom.


So My husband came home and I told him the lock will not be removed til his brother leaves and his reaction was to try and remove the lock himself and tell me to quit acting childishy. what I did was not shout or scream but pack a bag and go to my mom's house for the next few days or so til this gets resolved somehow. On my way out I saw my BIL in the driveway smoking. He knew what the argument between me and my husband was about but instead of stepping up to fix it he offered to take me to my mom's house saying that my husband could use some space ""from me"". This made me cry the whole uber ride to my mom's house. The reason I feel offended is because BIL tend to be hurtful when he talks about others. I did all I could to win his approval but he thinks less of me and thinks I'm childish just like my husband says.",26404,xgktnb,"NTA, BIL is doing this on purpose and not respecting any boundaries.

AITA for ignoring an autistic guy on my flight?,"AITA for ignoring an Autistic guy on my flight?

I'm a 19F who was traveling alone on an 11 hour flight today, and a guy in his 20s(?) Is in the same row as me. I was exhausted because I only got four hours of sleep before the flight so I could sleep on the plane, but this guy (we'll call him C) keeps trying to make conversation. C starts off by telling me he's autistic, and then asking me if I like KPOP and he keeps non stop talking and rarely gives me a chance to speak, not that I wanted to. 
I tried to be polite because I have ADHD and I understand how social cues are difficult so he probably can't tell I'm not in the mood. Over the course of the next 20 minutes I tell C maybe 5 times I want to sleep and put my headphones on and each time C begins speaking to me after maybe 2 minutes of silence. Finally I was able to sleep for around 4 hours, but when I woke up C started up again. I'm still really tired, and I had some personal issues the day before my flight so I'm also socially exhausted, but I let him talk for a bit before I start watching a show on my phone.
 I tell him maybe 5 seperate times that I'm trying to watch a show, and that I'm not interested in talking to him right now but maybe later. C still keeps trying to talk to me, and when I snap a bit and tell him I'm getting a bit annoyed he goes into a full on self-hating "" i'm so sorry, i'm horrible god im just gonna shut up now"" rant, and I feel bad because I should have been nicer to him and I can understand emotions being too strong and spiraling. I tell C that it's okay, and I just want some time to myself as I'm not the chattiest person, but maybe later we can talk. I put my headphones on and watched my show, but C kept trying to speak to me but this time I ignored him, which was honestly a shitty move from me but I just didn't have the energy at this point to interact with him. This was the wrong move, as he moved to get out of the row and stood in the aisle and began yelling at me. I didn't catch everything he said but it was along the lines of "" Why can't women believe not all men are bad. Some men are on your side. I'm a nice guy, why are you ignoring me."" He storms off to the bathroom and I take that chance to ask a flight attendant if I can change my seat because he really freaked me out and I didn't want to have a panic attack on a plane. The flight attendants were amazing and got my stuff and moved me far away from him.
 
I feel like i'm TA because he does have autism and I could have been more patient maybe and ignoring him was a shit thing to do.",26383,uxfsmw,NTA.

AITA for telling my girlfriend I'll keep honoring my best friend's dying wish even if it makes her uncomfortable?,"My late best friend and I knew each other since we were little. We were next-door neighbors and always played together. We even went to the same kindergarten, primary school and middle/high school together.

One day during our sophomore year, we started talking about how most of our classmates had started dating. We obviously weren’t okay with that and decided get one up on all of them by getting married. As a joke I made her a fake ring and she gave me her scrunchie.

A few weeks later, a drunk driver hit her. She sustained multiple injuries and was in the ICU for 2 months, the doctor told her family that her survival chances are slim. In the only time I talked to her before she died, she made me promise to always visit her on our ""wedding anniversary"" and to wear her scrunchie during the visit.

4 years ago when I started dating my girlfriend I told her about it and asked if she was okay with it. She commented about how sweet and nice the tradition was and told me she was perfectly fine with it.

Today was the 10th anniversary and I took the day off, before my girlfriend went to work she told me it’s time to put this tradition to rest and move on because it was starting to get pathetic that I still wear a dead girl scrunchie to celebrate a fake marriage that we had 10 years ago.

I was furious at her comments because she wasn’t just a “dead girl”. She was my best friend and like a sister to me, we grew up and did everything together. I told my girlfriend a long time ago that we never had a sexual or romantic relationship and that our wedding was just a joke. It’s not like I talk about her or keep her photos around the house or anything similar. The only times I've talked about her to my girlfriend is when I told her if she was okay with the tradition or if she asked me about her.

When I told her that I'll keep honoring my best friend's dying wish even if it made her uncomfortable, she left for work angry at me and hasn't came back home yet.",26333,ux9igm,"INFO. Very close to saying YTA though. 

I'm ASTONISHED by this sub's reaction. I'm getting weird vibes all over the place. 

I agree, it is possible OP has a shitty girlfriend who has to be first in everything and 'can't handle' the slightest emotional competition from a dead girl. 

You don't tell us ANYTHING about your relationship with your girlfriend. NOTHING. Is she... nice? Do you make time for her in your life? Do you live together? Do you like her? Do you give a single fuck about her? Is she a person? I'm not sure. The lack of detail about this woman is completely disturbing: she's anonymous, The Girlfriend, to the point of seeming like a Jungian archetype. 

But you've been with her for four years. There IS more context to be provided. WHERE is it?  WHY don't you feel any need to give it? It's so weird. So weird. Like, what's been going on with you guys lately? Have you, maybe, been fighting? Maybe because you don't communicate with her? Because she feels neglected, like you're emotionally closed off, like you don't express affection? Maybe because you don't make time for her, possibly don't give a shit about her, possibly are emotionally closed off, possibly has talked with you about this and this fight is the final straw? Are you a garbage boyfriend? No offense, just asking. 

**REDDIT: WTF. This is one snippet from a four-year relationship. To judge assholery, we need to understand this episode within the context of that relationship. With the** ***living*** **girl. The fact that OP doesn't give any is a huge red flag.**  

In your post you say: 

>I told my girlfriend a long time ago that we never had a sexual or romantic relationship and that our wedding was just a joke. **It’s not like I talk about her** or keep her photos around the house or anything similar. **The only times I've talked about her to my girlfriend** is when I told her if she was okay with the tradition or **if she asked me about her**. ""It's not like I talk about her or keep photos around the house."" 

""It's not like I ever actually talk to my girlfriend.""  You keep repeating this. But why are you saying this like it's a good thing? Why are you saying it like it's a defense? ""Duhh I literally never talk to my girlfriend about her, ever, so why doesn't she understand how important she was to me?""  ""I've completely closed off this part of my life to her, made it into this big weird secret between us, so why's that a problem in my relationship?"" 

Talk to your fucking girlfriend. Show her the pictures. Answer her questions. Share this part of your life with her. She's asking about it. Explain what this girl meant to you - not just by saying the words 'she was my best friend' or 'we were close' but by opening up and sharing your feelings and anecdotes and being emotionally vulnerable. Maybe, maybe, she won't be jealous at all. Maybe that's fundamentally not the issue, here. Maybe it's a narrative you've constructed for yourself to justify why not sharing this part of your life with your girlfriend is you being a good partner, not a bad partner, who is shutting her out. You're implying the only possible issue here is sexual or romantic or romantic jealous. But maybe all she needs is some communication. Maybe she would enjoy learning more about what your friend meant, and understand that this wasn't some random girl. You know, if you EXPLAIN it to her. 

I'm pissed off right now. I'm mad at Reddit. Dear AITA, YTA today. There's no reason to think that the girlfriend's issue is sexual or romantic jealousy except that HE implies it, as part of an internal justification for why never talking to his girlfriend is a virtue, not a vice. He implies that the only possible issue is her being jealous of a dead girl, and everyone is just so fucking ready it to believe it, even though there are more red flags in this post than I can count, no, the entire internet is just eating out of the palm of his hand. Fuck right off. All of you. You know why. I don't even have to say it.

AITA for blowing up on my fiancé infront of his family for getting my daughter's cat out of the house?,"I f35 got engaged to my fiancé Eric m37 2 months ago. He moved in with me and my daughter Zoey f13. Everything was going well til he started complaining about Zoey's cat which is strange because the cat is so sweet and quiet most of the time and so I had no idea what the issue was exactly.

Anyways, he went from complaining about the cat to making demands about her. He gave Zoey a list of places the cat can/can't go, things she's ""allowed"" to touch, banned her from places like kitchen and sofa (Zoey's favorite place to cuddle with her cat). Zoey showed me this list and I had an argument with him telling him he needed to stop this because it was ridiculous. He ranted about this being his house too and how he expects things to change after we get married.

Few days ago, I was at work and got a call from Zoey crying saying her cat wasn't in her room and in the house. I freaked out too and went home to look for her. Zoey and I looked for 2 hrs before a neighbor of ours brought her and told us that he saw Eric leaving her outside and getting in his car and leaving. I was surprised and quite angry. Zoey took her cat and went back inside. I immediately drove to my future inlaws home where Eric said he'd be. The second I saw him sitting with his family I went off and blew up at him infront of everyone. His mom asked what was happening and I told her her son got my daughter's INDOOR cat outside the house probably hoping for her to get lost. He argued about wanting me yo stop spouting nonesense and go home and we'd talk there but I refused. It got worse and I ended up leaving after his family flipped out at him.


He sent a bunch of texts talking about the stunt I pulled infront of his family. He said that he didn't mean to leave the cat out but after checking the cams I confirmed it. He still insisted that I humiliated him infront of his family and tried to turn them against him.

He's been staying with a friend and has stopped calling and texting.

AITA for laughing in my mother's friends face when she told me to 'go to my room'?,"I (25,F) don't speak to my mother, like at all. I had to go to my mother's house today to pick up an important document that I left behind when I moved out seven years ago.

As soon as I got to the house, my mother suddenly had a massive 'emergency' and realised that it was apparently her friend's funeral today and she completely forgot about it. I couldn't help but internally roll my eyes, as there is always some drama hence why I have gone no/very low contact. 

She asked me if I would watch my two younger brothers (7 and 11) whilst she went to the funeral, and I said absolutely not, as it's my only day off, I have plans, and I have no relationship with them due to my mother stopping them from seeing me for years. I just wanted to get my birth certificate and leave. 

My mother asked her friend if she would babysit and asked me to stay for 10 minutes until her friend came. I didn't even get the opportunity to say no before my mother left the house. I was seething but resolved to wait 10 minutes. My mother's friend turned up and started berating me for not agreeing to look after my brother's whilst my mother went to the funeral. 

I said 'I don't have anything to do with my mother, it's my day off work, and I'm under no obligation to look after anyone else's children'. My mother's friend then told me to 'go to my room'. I laughed in her face and started to leave the house, and she asked me where I was going. And I told her, 'my room, at my apartment, that I pay for with my big girl job. Because I'm an adult, not a child. And don't ever speak down to me like that again'. And I left. 

My mother has left me loads of messages and missed calls saying I'm an AH for the way I spoke to her friend. I do admit I look kinda young but I still am not happy with the way my mother's friend spoke to me.

AITA for taking my daughter to get her hair cut when I knew it would upset my wife?,"Me (29M) and my wife (30F) have a little girl (8F) who I'll be calling Anna.

Now, Anna has very thick, blonde and curly hair that my wife adores. Ever since she was a toddler, she'd spend hours doing her hair every day, braiding it, straightening it and styling it in all sorts of ways. Our bathroom cabinets are always filled to the brim with a bunch of hair lotions, oils, creams and other fancy products I don't even know the names of. So I think it's more than fair to say that my wife's a bit obsessed with the whole hair thing. Anna, however, has never been too fond of getting her hair done, or of anything that involves having to sit still for more than a few minutes.

Before she got it cut, her hair used to reach past her waist. And while it looked lovely, she hated getting it brushed and every morning used to be a screaming fest between her and my wife. Lately, she'd been begging for a shorter haircut. My wife ignored her whenever the topic was brought up in hopes that she'd forget about it, but none of that ended up happening. 

I think Anna realized she was getting nowhere with her mom, because she started asking me to take her instead. I was reluctant to at first because I didn't know how my wife would react, but I agreed when I saw just how excited the kid was over something as simple as a haircut.

So yesterday I drove her to the hairdresser, where she got to flip through a lot of magazines and pick a picture of a haircut. And when she chose a really short clipper cut, I knew I was gonna be in deep shit with my wife. At that point though, there was no turning back. I mean, what could I have really done? Told her that no, she can't get the haircut she was so over the moon about, all because her mom wouldn't like it? I couldn't do that.

So we went ahead with the haircut, and by the end of it Anna couldn't stop smiling. She went around the salon showing it off to everyone and even asked me to take a bunch of pictures even though she normally hates having pictures taken of her. We did get one rude comment from an older woman at the salon, something along the lines of 'You can't even tell if she's a boy or a girl now', but Anna was way too excited about her hair to notice, and if she did notice she didn't care.

When my wife got home from work that day though, things quickly took a turn for the worse. She refused to even look at Anna, locked herself in her room and cried then got in the car and drove off. It's been a day now and she's still not back, it's honestly starting to worry me. I knew she wouldn't react well to the haircut but I wasn't expecting her to take it this badly. The kid's upset too and no matter how much I reassure her she still thinks she's in trouble for getting her hair cut. 

AITA? I realize how attached my wife was to Anna's hair, but at the end of the day I still think it's just hair. The kid's old enough to decide these things for herself and she was really happy with the haircut, so I don't think I did something wrong here.",26202,uarm30,NTA.

AITA for not paying for my daughter's wedding because she invited my brother and his family,"I'm 46M, my brother 48M.

When I was 20, my then girlfriend cheated with my brother. I was heartbroken and pissed. I told him he is no longer my brother. Despite my request, my family didnt cut him off, so I told them that I will never again be in the same place as he is. If they wish to invite both, then they should just invite him as I am the one giving ultimate.

My daughter is getting married in spring next year. In our culture both parents are paying for the wedding, 50/50. Unexpectedly, my daughter sat me down and told me that she will be inviting my brother and his family(he married my cheating ex). Apparently, she was seeing them for the last 4 years and built a relationship behind my back. She even wants her cousin to be some kind of flower girl.

I was pissed. I told her what my boundaries are and if my brother is invited then I will not pay my part of the wedding. She became angry and told me its time to let go of the past. I told her its not her call to make. We argued some more and she told me I am making her wedding about myself. I told her I will probably not even attend so it will be all about her. She left crying.

My ex-wife called me screaming and told me I'm huge AH and our daughter is crushed. Then my parents called, same thing. I told them off and now I'm ignoring their calls. My GF told me to reconsider and appologize. That by not paying and attending I will break relationship with my daughter. I don't know. I think my boundaries should be respected. Am I asshole for that?",26182,y9591p,"Look you are NTA the asshole for feeling what you are feeling and wanting nothing to do with your brother. You had a right to set your boundaries with your brother, but your daughter is not bound by those boundaries. 

And I just have to say Reddit is nuts - most people on here must be living some privileged life if the worst thing that has happened to them is someone cheating on them. 

Cutting your brother off when this happened was healthy, but asking your parents to cut their relationship was nuts. Your brother and that woman have been together or 20 years (?) now... It's insane to hold on to this anger and Nuke the relationships around you. 

Why did your daughter want a relationship with her uncle? Is their daughter her only cousin/sibling? Do you have a problem with the daughter coming or just your brother and wife? There is a lot of missing information here. 

In the end, with the info given, I think you have the right to make whatever decision you want and technically I would go as far as saying  you are in the right here morally - but you are going to end up alone - and will it be worth it to be right and alone in your specific case ... I guess you get to decide that. (I personally would have let this go and moved on - I wouldn't have a relationship with my brother but I would be civil on the few events I may have to him for my loved ones sake)

I have seen a lot of parents on here regretting their decisions with their child even when they were morally correct in the decisions they made. I would hate to see you in that same spot ... sometimes some things are more important than being right. I would decide if being right is worth loosing your daughter.",83,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/y9591p/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_daughters_wedding/,"['im', 'brother', 'was', 'girlfriend', 'cheated', 'brother', 'was', 'heartbroken', 'pissed', 'told', 'longer', 'brother', 'despite', 'request', 'family', 'cut', 'told', 'never', 'place', 'wish', 'invite', 'invite', 'one', 'giving', 'ultimate', 'daughter', 'getting', 'married', 'spring', 'next', 'year', 'culture', 'parents', 'paying', 'wedding', 'unexpectedly', 'daughter', 'sat', 'told', 'inviting', 'brother', 'his', 'familyhe', 'married', 'cheating', 'ex', 'apparently', 'was', 'seeing', 'last', 'years', 'built', 'relationship', 'behind', 'back', 'even', 'wants', 'cousin', 'kind', 'flower', 'girl', 'was', 'pissed', 'told', 'boundaries', 'brother', 'invited', 'pay', 'part', 'wedding', 'became', 'angry', 'told', 'its', 'time', 'let', 'go', 'past', 'told', 'its', 'call', 'make', 'argued', 'told', 'making', 'wedding', 'told', 'probably', 'even', 'attend', 'left', 'crying', 'ex-wife', 'called', 'screaming', 'told', 'im', 'huge', 'ah', 'daughter', 'crushed', 'parents', 'called', 'thing', 'told', 'im', 'ignoring', 'calls', 'gf', 'told', 'reconsider', 'appologize', 'paying', 'attending', 'break', 'relationship', 'daughter', 'know', 'think', 'boundaries', 'respected', 'asshole']",im brother was girlfriend cheated brother was heartbroken pissed told longer brother despite request family cut told never place wish invite invite one giving ultimate daughter getting married spring next year culture parents paying wedding unexpectedly daughter sat told inviting brother his familyhe married cheating ex apparently was seeing last years built relationship behind back even wants cousin kind flower girl was pissed told boundaries brother invited pay part wedding became angry told its time let go past told its call make argued told making wedding told probably even attend left crying ex-wife called screaming told im huge ah daughter crushed parents called thing told im ignoring calls gf told reconsider appologize paying attending break relationship daughter know think boundaries respected asshole 
AITA for changing the door locks back after my wife changed them?,"I <30M> have a beautiful wife who loves to serve others. We bought a home down the street from my family. I have a sweet sister <17>
Who likes to crash at our house with her friends. 

My wife normally is pretty easy going until recently. My sisters friends have been leaving messes. Mostly towels on the floor after using our pool. My wife got upset picking up after them every day.  I have asked my sister to make sure the house is clean after they leave and it has been better. My wife also complained that some of her perfumes/Clothes personal items have gone missing.
My sister said it’s not her. I believe my sister. I just don’t see her doing that. I told my wife and we agreed to just replace them.

Last week my wife made a couple of pans of cinnamon rolls from scratch. One pan was for us, the second pan was for a co-workers family who is experiencing a tragedy. 

My wife went to the gym. I went to work and my sister and her friends came by. The one pan wasn’t enough for her and her friends.
They wanted the second pan of cinnamon rolls and my sister texted my wife asking if they could eat them. My wife said no.

They ate them anyways. My wife upset went and bought new locks. When I came home my wife handed me a new key and told me that she didn’t want anyone else to have a key to our house.

I tried to calm her down and tell her that I would just go replace the eaten cinnamon rolls with store bought ones. My wife decided this was her hill to die on and said no my sister lost the privilege to come when we are not home. Replacing stolen items wasn’t “good enough” anymore.

My mom called and asked if my sister could use the pool as a back to school party? I was under the impression my mom would be there. I said yes, my mom was at work and our schedules clashed. The easiest solution was for me To change the locks back so they could come into the house.

My mom didn’t come with my sister. When my wife got home after the party. It was a mess. She sent me photos. She called me the A for changing the locks without talking to her about it. (Keep in mind she did too.) then told me I broke her trust. She wasn’t safe in her home because she keeps getting robbed and I refuse to put an end to it. (I did talk to my sister). Then my wife let me know she was staying with a friend for awhile. 

Am I the A here? I feel like I have tried to right any wrongs that have happened. 
Between my wife and my sister.

Update* sorry I haven’t been able to reply the past couple of hours. I have been busy.

I talked to my mom again and let her know my sister isn’t allowed over without me home. 

I asked a friends wife who is a maid to come deep clean our home. So if/when my wife comes home it’s clean.

The last thing is my mom asked me to help cover my sisters cheer. She is on track for a scholarship. I told my mom I would pay half of my wife’s things were returned. If not the money was going to replace the stolen items.

Also my sister was invited to home coming. She wanted me to buy a dress. I told her no for not following our home rules and the money I saved for the dress is going to pay for the maid.

I did replace the locks again. I also am planning a romantic dinner I will make and clean up. I heard a lot about the cinnamon rolls. Someone on here gave me the idea to make them. I am for a dessert.

Update: my sister and my mom left a few mins ago. My sister had a bag of my wife’s things. More than I thought was gone. Most items are in poor shape.

The big thing is she had my wife’s grandmothers ring I thought was in the safe. I had no idea it was gone. My sister said that she found it on my wife’s night stand during the party. She forgot she had it on when she left our home. The ring isn’t valuable it’s just sentimental. I told my mom who the ring belonged to. My mom lost it. My sister is now grounded.

Last update tonight, my wife is coming home. I am staying at a friends house. Until we can work some of this out. 
I already stated it but I did put the locks back on my wife bought. My family doesn’t have that key.

Early morning update, My mom called my wife last night and asked what my sister can do to fix/ replace the damaged items.
My wife said “have her meet me every morning at 5 am.” I decided to tag along and see what my wife had planned. Trying to support her in whatever punishment she decides to do. You know the cinnamon rolls. My wife’s co-works 4 yr old is in the final stages of cancer. My wife’s plan is for my sister and her to prepare breakfast, get their other kids up and ready for the day. Start laundry, basic clean up. So her co-worker and his wife can spend as much time as he can with the sick child before work.

My sister was silent the whole time coming back home.
I can tell it really hit her that her life isn’t as hard. Even being grounded.

Last and final post, my wife has given me a second chance as long as I follow her list of rules.
1) for awhile no family at our home
2) no family borrowing our things. 
3)no one is allowed a key
4)I help with the chores around the house. Including cooking meals.
5) last My wife is ok with me seeing my sister but asked that we all go to counseling to understand why my sister is targeting her. 
My wife said all of this has been really hard and she doesn’t want to cause more issues but she just doesn’t trust my sister and can’t have her using out things.",26109,x0sib1,[removed],6736,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x0sib1/aita_for_changing_the_door_locks_back_after_my/,"['<', '>', 'beautiful', 'wife', 'loves', 'serve', 'others',

AITA for refusing to pay for girl’s wig after she shaved it because of me?,"There’s this girl that lives in my uni halls, we’re not roommates but we are flatmates. Let’s name her Kaya (F, 19). I (F, 19) met her in September when we started university and moved into halls. We’re not best friends but we are friendly. We don’t really spend much time together.  


Over time, my friends noticed that Kaya tried to copy me in everything. It started slowly, accessories and some clothes. Nothing major. I didn’t even notice until people started pointing it out to me. I have a rather distinct style and she started copying it. I don’t owe the style and she’s free to wear what she likes but it’s the exact same copies of my outfits which is very odd.


But then, it started going further. I dyed my hair, she dyed her hair, I bought something for my room, she bought the same thing. I started chatting with a guy, she became obsessed with that guy to a point that whenever I had a male friend or guy I was interested in over, she would go out of her way to try and get their attention, coming down to the kitchen in nothing but a towel (she never used to do it), etc. And she would do anything to attract attention. Now, don’t get me wrong, I couldn’t care less if the guy was looking and even if it was my boyfriend looking, I’d have a beef with him not her  but the blatant attention seeking behaviour was just odd. 
I joined societies and sports and after she found out, she joined the same ones I did. 
Basically, everything I do, she copies eventually. It’s just really creepy but I haven’t said anything, I wouldn’t even know what to say.

Over the Easter break, my friend and I were at my family house, a bit drunk and decided to test out whether Kaya really copies everything I do. I made a post on social media about shaving my head. My friend does hairdressing and she helped me out faking shaved head and I posted a photo with shaved head.

I deleted the photo few days later and forgot about this whole thing. After easter break was over, we had uni exams and I was focusing on that. Imagine my shock when I came back and Kaya had shaved head. And she was pissed when she saw me. She started shouting how I lied to her and why would I do that. She went on and on and on, really angry. Admittedly, I ignored her and hid in my room. She sent me a text telling me that she expects me to pay for her wig as it’s my fault she shaved her head. I replied that absolutely not, that it was not my fault and she decided on her own to do that.
She kept attacking me over it every time I saw her (it’s been a few days since I came back from easter break). My exams start tomorrow and yesterday I received an e-mail from my university, asking me for a meeting over the issue. She REPORTED me to uni over something she’s done. I am genuinely confused, was I really in the wrong. AITA for pretending to shave my head and refusing to pay for her wig?",26102,ukzctc,"NTA

This meeting with the university is a good thing. Before you go in, sit down and write out every time she has made you uncomfortable, every aspect of copying that you’ve noticed. Try to get evidence, like receipts of purchases you’ve made that she went on to buy. The date of your hairdressing appointment where you dyed your hair, which will predate hers. The dates of you joining societies, you first, and then her. See if any of your classmates are also willing to speak that they have noticed her unhealthy obsession - perhaps the men she’s become obsessed with after noticing you talking to them?

Then make sure the meeting does not include her. You need to feel comfortable to speak openly without her in the room, as she will not react well. When you walk in, immediately thank them for calling for a meeting to address her harassment of you. Take control and lay out everything that’s happened. Explain that you are becoming increasingly concerned for your safety, to the extent you are hiding in your room. It’s affecting your ability to study. She clearly has issues that she needs professional assistance with. If they ask why you haven’t confronted her, reply that you didn’t feel safe because her behaviour is becoming more and more unhinged.

Also, really highlight that you and your friend posted a photograph to your personal social media while you were at home on Easter break. You were off university grounds, during a university break, using non-university websites. It is entirely out of their purview. You also didn’t send this directly to Kaya, or make any suggestion to her that she do the same. Kaya accessed your social media, made assumptions, and continued her attempt to imitate you. You are NOT responsible for her actions, and her reaction to the realisation she no longer resembled you is alarming.

Then ask them how they are going to protect you from someone whose behaviour is now bordering on stalking. Ask if they are willing to support you in talking to the police about a potential restraining order. And then actually call the police. Whether or not they are able to do anything yet, you need this on record, and they will have information on how to protect yourself.

This may sounds extreme, but I assure you, it’s not. Kaya is becoming dangerous. She has moved beyond copying to anger. The next step in that escalation is to destroy the object of her attention. That’s why she has reported you. She wants you to be punished. When this doesn’t get the desired results, her frustration will make her angrier. She will eventually get violent if this isn’t nipped in the bud. She may try to cut your hair so that you and she look alike again.

September was only eight months ago. This isn’t a long period of time and look how invested she is already. Please take this seriously. Don’t let embarrassment or a desire to keep the peace prevent you from protecting yourself. Kaya has taken advantage of your good nature so far, and is now trying to mess with your education. Lay down your boundaries in steel. She is not to ever contact you again. You aren’t to have classes together or share living space. Please take care OP. It’s better to prevent it getting worse rather than wait until it actually is worse.",2097,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ukzctc/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_girls_wig_after_she/,"['theres', 'this', 'girl', 'lives', 'uni', 'halls', 'roommates', 'flatmates', 'lets', 'name', 'kaya', 'met', 'september', 'started', 'university', 'moved', 'halls', 'best', 'friends', 'friendly', 'really', 'spend', 'much', 'time', 'together', 'time', 'friends', 'noticed', 'kaya', 'tried', 'copy', 'everything', 'started', 'slowly', 'accessories', 'clothes', 'nothing', 'major', 'even', 'notice', 'people', 'started', 'pointing', 'rather', 'distinct', 'style', 'started', 'copying', 'owe', 'style', 'shes', 'free', 'wear', 'likes', 'its', 'exact', 'copies', 'outfits', 'very', 'odd', 'started', 'going', 'dyed', 'hair', 'dyed', 'hair', 'bought', 'something', 'room', 'bought', 'thing', 'started', 'chatting', 'guy', 'became', 'obsessed', 'guy', 'point', 'whenever', 'male', 'friend', 'guy', 'was', 'interested', 'would', 'go', 'way', 'try', 'get', 'attention', 'coming', 'kitchen', 'nothing', 'towel', 'never', 'used', 'etc', 'would', 'anything', 'attract', 'attention', 'get', 'wrong', 'care', 'less', 'guy', 'was', 'looking', 'even', 'was', 'boyfriend', 'looking', 'id', 'beef', 'blatant', 'attention', 'seeking', 'behaviour', 'was', 'odd', 'joined', 'societies', 'sports', 'found', 'joined', 'ones', 'basically', 'everything', 'copies', 'eventually', 'its', 'really', 'creepy', 'said', 'anything', 'even', 'know', 'say', 'easter', 'break', 'friend', 'family', 'house', 'bit', 'drunk', 'decided', 'test', 'whether', 'kaya', 'really', 'copies', 'everything', 'made', 'post', 'social', 'media', 'shaving', 'head', 'friend', 'does', 'hairdressing', 'helped', 'faking', 'shaved', 'head', 'posted', 'photo', 'shaved', 'head', 'deleted', 'photo', 'days', 'later', 'forgot', 'this', 'whole', 'thing', 'easter', 'break', 'was', 'uni', 'exams', 'was', 'focusing', 'imagine', 'shock', 'came', 'back', 'kaya', 'shaved', 'head', 'was', 'pissed', 'saw', 'started', 'shouting', 'lied', 'why', 'would', 'went', 'really', 'angry', 'admittedly', 'ignored', 'hid', 'room', 'sent', 'text', 'telling', 'expects', 'pay', 'wig', 'its', 'fault', 'shaved', 'head', 'replied', 'absolutely', 'was', 'fault', 'decided', 'kept', 'attacking', 'every', 'time', 'saw', 'its', 'days', 'since', 'came', 'back', 'easter', 'break', 'exams', 'start', 'tomorrow', 'yesterday', 'received', '-mail', 'university', 'asking', 'meeting', 'issue', 'reported', 'uni', 'something', 'shes', 'done', 'genuinely', 'confused', 'was', 'really', 'wrong', 'aita', 'pretending', 'shave', 'head', 'refusing', 'pay', 'wig']",theres this girl lives uni halls roommates flatmates lets name kaya met september started university moved halls best friends friendly really spend much time together time friends noticed kaya tried copy everything started slowly accessories clothes nothing major even notice people started pointing rather distinct style started copying owe style shes free wear likes its exact copies outfits very odd started going dyed hair dyed hair bought something room bought thing started chatting guy became obsessed guy point whenever male friend guy was interested would go way try get attention coming kitchen nothing towel never used etc would anything attract attention get wrong care less guy was looking even was boyfriend looking id beef blatant attention seeking behaviour was odd joined societies sports found joined ones basically everything copies eventually its really creepy said anything even know say easter break friend family house bit drunk decided test whether kaya really copies everything made post social media shaving head friend does hairdressing helped faking shaved head posted photo shaved head deleted photo days later forgot this whole thing easter break was uni exams was focusing imagine shock came back kaya shaved head was pissed saw started shouting lied why would went really angry admittedly ignored hid room sent text telling expects pay wig its fault shaved head replied absolutely was fault decided kept attacking every time saw its days since came back easter break exams start tomorrow yesterday received -mail university asking meeting issue reported uni something shes done genuinely confused was really wrong aita pretending shave head refusing pay wig 
AITA for taking off my leg and making someone look dumb and feel uncomfortable?,"I (21F) was in a very bad car accident about three years ago. A drunk drive ran a stop light, cut off a semi-truck, which then crashed into me, sending me crashing into two different cars and then ultimately into an embankment. My car was mangled and my leg was crushed, completely destroyed, and it had to be amputated. I also lost a couple fingers (the tip of one and all of another). I'm also left with some gnarly scars that used to bother me but I'm learning to deal with them. I got a couple different insurance payouts and some pain and suffering money in addition to my medical bills being paid and with my money I purchased a custom-made leg to take the place of the one I lost. When I have pants and shoes on you can hardly tell unless you're really looking. I still limp but some days I don't have as pronounced a limp.

Earlier today I went to the store with my boyfriend, my sister, her girlfriend, and our mother. I drove. I had to learn to drive with my left foot but I'm really good at it now. I also bought a new car with my money and had to go through a ton of therapy to get past my PTSD but I'm doing well there now as well. So, I drove us, and because of my injuries (in addition to my leg I also have chronic hip, neck, and back pain, and some issues with my lungs from the time spent intubated in a medically-induced coma that led to pneumonia) I have a handicap placard for my car. I have trouble walking without getting tired so it really helps to park close to the door. Today I did so and unknowingly took the space from someone who was circling back around for it. Apparently the man had been looking for a close space and had missed the one I took and went down and around. He was still on the other aisle when I pulled in so I didn't cut him off or anything and had no way of knowing he wanted the spot.

He parked in the yellow stripe zone and got out and immediately began confronting me about stealing a space from people who actually need it, how I'm just some kid who has no respect for those who are truly sick and suffering. He then ordered me to move. My group was urging me to just walk way but this has happened before and once the police were even called. I'm sick of people thinking that just because I'm young that I don't have a legit need for a little extra consideration. I said ""Okay"", and went to the car and got in like I was going to drive off. I was wearing a skirt and leggings so it wasn't quite obvious at first but when I sat down I took my leg off and showed it to the man, including my stump. I then asked him if it was okay if I still parked there. He walked away calling me disgusting and rude and said I could have just told him and I made him look stupid.

My group was embarrassed and said that I made things awkward because there was a crowd. AITA?

Edit: in case anyone was interested: I'm not going to post a photo of my leg because of identification reasons but I'll describe it. So the base color is ombre whiteish green to pale green and it has cherry blossoms painted on it, though sometimes I wear a silicone cover that resembles an actual foot and leg on days when I don't want people to stare at me. I even have temporary stickies I can put on the ""toes"" to make it look like I painted my nails. It's actually really cool!",26064,t65zud,"NTA

AITA for refusing to let my future husband lie about the house he and I purchased during his 'groom speech'?,"
My fiancè (37M) and I (33F) got engaged few months ago. We're getting married soon and invitations were already sent out. right now we're focusing on much smaller details. We've also been busy moving into our new home that we purchased together (30% of his savings + 70% of mine). I have to say that saving up for this house took most of my savings and prevented me from enjoying the things I love spending money on.


My fiancè sat me down yesterday to talk about his 'groom speech'. he talked about few points but what made me upset was when he asked if I would be okay if he mentions the house we bought and say that HE was the one who bought it. I was a bit taken aback, I asked why and he said it's ""just a confidence boost"" during the speech and that's it. I said I didn't feel comfortable with the idea because I think that it's unfair not to acknowledge the fact that I'd sacrificed so much to be able to buy the house. I reminded him of how much I contributed but he said this doesn't change that it's our house so it shouldn't matter to me if he said he bought it himself or we both did. I refused because then people will always think the house was bought by him which is something that will never change no matter how hard I try to prove that I contributed 70%. He got made at me and said that I was really overthinking this whole thing and making a big deal out of it. We got into an argument and he started yelling saying it's just one favor he's asking me to do and yet, I'm making this ridiculous, small request my hill to die on.

He's basically sulking and now he's out and refusing to answer my calls so basically he's started the silent treatment til I cave in. AITA for making this my hill to die on?

[EDIT] My fiance comes from more humble background and money has always been a struggle for him and his family. It's become obvious how insecure he can be when it comes to money, especially when he compares how much I make VS how he makes.

AITA for ransacking my boyfriend’s apartment?,"I (f25) have been with my boyfriend “Jake” (m34) for 8 months. Things were fine until I (against my better judgment) moved into his place a couple months ago. Since then, he’s been getting kind of possessive and protective. I immediately told him to cut that shit out because it’s off-putting, and things seemed to get better. 

Anyway, I have a friend in Mexico who is getting married. I’ve been excited to fly down for her wedding since she told me she was engaged a year ago. However, Jake has made it clear that he doesn’t want me to go. He says Mexico is too dangerous, even though I’ve been there many times and even lived there for a year, speak Spanish, have friends there, and know my way around. No matter what I say, he doesn’t want me to go. 

Then a couple of days ago my passport went missing from my nightstand. I’m supposed to go tomorrow, so I wouldn’t have time to get a new one. I looked everywhere, no luck. When I asked Jake about it, he behaved a little suspiciously, but I dismissed it because I couldn’t believe he would actually take my passport to keep me from going. 

But he’s been giving me some red flags, so I decided to have a thorough look around. When he went out this morning, I started going through everything. As I searched, I became increasingly certain that he took my passport. I started off carefully picking through drawers and cabinets, but as my anger grew, I became a lot less careful. I started turning out drawers, pried open a brief case, made a total mess. But I found it. It was behind some books on the bookcase in his study. I never go into his study. He definitely put it there. 

Now he’s furious with me for going through his things and ransacking his place. He said he would have given my passport back, and there was no need for me to “go crazy.”I’m just angry that he took it to begin with, and I don’t believe him when he says he was going to give it back. 

This is only my third serious relationship, and I have no perspective on this kind of thing. AITA for “overreacting” and ransacking my (ex)boyfriend’s place?

Edit: thanks for the replies. I guess I was still in a weird state of disbelief that he did that and it made me question everything. Now that I’ve stopped shaking and have had the time to think, talk to my mom, and to read through these replies, I feel kinda silly for even wondering if I did something wrong. Suffice it to say it’s over for good, I’ve blocked him on everything and my dad and brother are over there getting what’s left of my stuff.

She didn't want me to live here and wants me gone. I've insisted that I should stay as I don't want to live with my mom (her husband is a piece of work...) so we're always clashing.

She announced last month that she wouldn't allow me to eat anything she cooks, or cook anything that she buys and I should arange my own food completely separately (down to the ingredient level, including salt!) because I'm not her problem to deal with. This is annoying but anyway, I can handle it and I didn't want to act entitled so I started buying and cooking my own food. We've been going like this since then.

Her sister had an accident a few days ago and on the day of the accident step mother texted me in the afternoon saying she's bringing the sister's children over and they'll arrive around midnight, asked me to buy groceries and snacks and make a late dinner for them. I never replied to her and didn't do anything. I have to say that while for a few hours it didn't look good for her sister and had to go into surgery it ended up being successful and she will thankfully make a full recovery.

They came, she noticed there's no food and they indeed were hungry so she was angry at me and I told her that it's not my problem to deal with... and she said I'm being a jerk and I said takes one to know one. She ended up ordering Pizza.

My dad told me that I was out of line and I should have just done what she wanted me to do because it was an emergency, and I should have done a favor for her and it would have gone a long way to improve our relationshiop. I told him that our relationship has always been hopeless because she hated me for no reason so there's nothing I can do that can make her hate me any less and at this point I've accepted it and don't care anymore. He said it's not true and I'm now grounded.",25982,vzq3nf,"NTA. You are NOT entitled.

AITA For telling my pregnant daughter that my husband and I will have nothing to do with raising her baby in front of the entire family?,"Hello, I am a fifty-six-year-old mother to thirty-three-year-old Kelly and grandmother to sixteen-year-old Opal. Kelly became pregnant with Opal at sixteen. My husband, Eddy, and I have always believed in having the right to choose. However, Kelly insisted that she wanted to keep the baby and not give it up for adoption.

We helped a lot as Kelly was only seventeen when Opal was born. However, Kelly would rarely help with parenting even when she was available. Even asking her to watch Opal for an hour while we ran errands was an issue. It was rare that Kelly wouldn’t complain about why she “had to be there"" to look after Opal.

Kelly chose not to attend college after graduation. She had a job with a flexible schedule, yet she rarely made herself available for Opal. Kelly was only home to sleep or get dressed for some party. She also relied on us to purchase supplies and book appointments for Opal. Eddy and I would have serious talks with Kelly that she needed to step up as a parent. Kelly would only make empty promises and never follow through on them.

Kelly moved out when Opal was six. Kelly comes around maybe once a fortnight and for holidays, but Eddy and I have been the ones to raise Opal. Opal is doing extremely well. She has good friends, plays Tennis, participates in volunteer projects, and plans to be a marine biologist after graduation.

The school year ended for Opal last week, so we had a nice dinner to celebrate her good grades. Kelly came, along with several other family members. We were all chatting and enjoying dinner together when Kelly stood up to make an announcement. She announced to us that she was pregnant with her boyfriend’s child.

We already were upset because this was supposed to be Opal’s special moment and Kelly announcing her pregnancy was completely inappropriate. Eddy and I said nothing, and Kelly started to say how she and her boyfriend were “so busy!” with life right now.

Eddy and I interrupted Kelly and told her we would have nothing to do with raising this new baby and would not be providing anything for it (supplies, childcare, etc.) Kelly flipped out and an argument ensued.

Kelly called us heartless and claimed we were willing to throw our grandchild away. Eddy and I called her selfish for expecting us to raise another child. We are too old to raise a baby. Kelly is thirty-three and needs to grow up. Give the baby up for adoption or be a parent and raise it yourself.

Kelly left in tears. Now the family has broken into “sides.” The ones agreeing with Kelly say that we adopted Opal and are sending a message that we don’t care about our newest grandchild. Others are saying we should have taken her aside privately instead of shooting her down in front of everyone and our reaction was cruel. Eddy and I feel we had to be blunt with Kelly and not sugarcoat reality.

Opal likes to show us stories from here sometimes, so I thought it would be a good place to ask for a neutral perspective. AITA?

Edit: Opal is always able to express her feelings with me or Eddy. Opal also has a therapist who is available to speak whenever she needs it. Opal visited the therapist weekly during middle school but now hasn't needed to see him more than once a month. We will be taking Opal on a mall trip to make up for what happened at the celebration dinner.

We spoke privately to Opal after this incident and she knows we in no way view her as a burden. Our granddaughter is a blessing and many of our happiest moments involved supporting Opal and watching her grow up. But Opal is sixteen: She doesn't need the kind of constant attention and care that a newborn baby does. We are now too old to be able to adequately raise a newborn baby even if we wanted to.

The biggest problem is that Kelly is now an adult and needs to start acting like one. Kelly is supposed to outlive us. The reality is that Eddy and I aren't going to be alive for her or her children's entire lives. It is why Kelly needs to accept that she cannot expect us to take on her responsibilities and must be independent.

Edit #2: Several people have informed me that the part where Kelly expected us to raise the new baby was unclear, so I apologize for that. I thought it was self-explanatory, but realize none of you actually experienced what happened.

Kelly talked about how busy she and her boyfriend were with their lives, then began to talk about how ""grateful"" she was that we ""would always look after our grandchildren"" and how since we had ""gained so much joy from raising Opal, we would be even happier raising this second baby!""

After Eddy and I called her out, Kelly confirmed that she had expected us to adopt and raise this second baby as well. Kelly said how she and her boyfriend did not have time to raise a baby but that putting up the baby for adoption would be ""throwing it away."" She assumed we, at almost sixty years old, would have no troubles or opposition to raising a newborn baby.",25950,v9gppu,"Your daughter has already completely disregarded Opal. Making her ""good news I have a real baby now!"" announcement at an end of school year party for Opal is some more grade A trash behavior. It's not a graduation party, is it? Because that would make it even worse behavior on Kelly's part. You may not have let them know in the most civil way possible, but I'm gonna say NTA because of how thoroughly Kelly has made it clear her daughter doesn't matter. You may have eventually raised her enough to call it ""adoption,"" but that was never the original intent, so Kelly can suck it.

Edited to add: **I completely missed that this was them asking you to raise the next one.** Holy fucking shit. Utter garbage, these people. I'm glad you said something right there. Firmly, loudly, rudely. They needed to hear it. Really, I would've supported being far more rude than you were. I'm glad Opal is in therapy and I'm glad she knows you don't see her as a burden. Kelly is the burden.

AITA for telling my husband he should be ashamed of himself and he would be incredibly lucky if his oldest daughter ever speaks to him again?,"I married my husband 3 years ago. He was divorced, and previously widowered. He has two daughters. Annie who is now 26 (I believe) from his first marriage and Amy who is 17 from his second. My husband told me about his late wife, his ex wife, the issues he had as a blended family when he remarried and Annie was not on board with him remarrying and the fact this strain ended his second marriage. He was also honest that Annie never forgave him for remarrying and never wanted anything to do with Amy or him after she turned 18.

What he did not tell me was the MAJOR role he played in all of this. I found this out three weeks ago, at a dinner with his extended family.

The story as I now know it. When Amy was around 5 years old she took a special interest in a necklace that belonged to his late wife. My husband gave the necklace to Amy, which upset Annie, because all her mothers possessions were meant to go to her. My husband told Annie that it was just one item and she needed to get over it because Amy was entitled to have something too. Annie had brought up that it was the piece her mother wore the most. My husband told her that it was a special gift to give to her sister. That she was being selfish. His ex wife told her that her mother would want ""someone as special as your sister"" to have a piece of her as well. Annie never got over it. She tried to take it from Amy and was punished. The last time she saw any of them she told them all to go to fucking hell.

Amy still has the necklace too. She has let it get into a bad way, and talks about it as if her dad bought it for her.

I was shocked. I never would have expected my husband to be that way. He was very unapologetic about it and told me Annie would have to get over it some day. I told him he should be ashamed of himself. That he should have allowed Annie's mothers possessions to be hers, to do with as SHE chose, that Amy did not give a crap about his late wife or the significance of those items, but Annie would have. I told him he will be incredibly lucky if his daughter ever speaks to him again and I would not blame her if she never did.

He was furious I judged him. His family said I should take my husbands side over his daughter who I don't even know (except for the nephew and niece who told the whole story, because they also think my husband did a fucked up thing).

AITA for searching my husband's pants without asking him first?,"

Context: my husband [33] used to be unemployed for a year, he recently started a job at a warehouse. 

Yesterday, and while I was about to do the laundry, I grabbed his work pants and digged my hand in it's pockets to empty them before putting it in the washing machine like I  always do. 

My husband just happened to walk by and when he saw me searching his pants pockets. He rushed in yelling at me to put his pants down. I already had a folded piece of paper out but he snatched it then started screaming at me about how I have no respect for his privacy and that I shouldn't be getting my hands on his things. I was genuinly dumbfounded I told him to take it easy I alwaye do this before laundry. He lashed out saying I had no right and should've come to him and asked him first because he was worried about important documents getting lost like the one I pulled out. I said important documents shouldn't be inside his pockets and asked to see the paper but he said he won't show me. I asked why and he said I don't get to ask him jack shit after I disrespected his privacy. I almost laughed because what privacy does he have in pockets? It wasn't like a stranger was digging into them.

AITA for putting parental controls on my TV and royally pissing off my FIL?,"I (M30's) live with my wife (F30's). We have two kids, M8 and F6.

My wife's parents are staying with us temporarily as their home is having some serious repairs after a freak accident. It wasn't their fault and luckily they had insurance. The repairs should be completed in two months from now.

I don't really get along with my in-laws, especially my father-in-law, but I agreed to let them stay because I thought the time would fly by and it wouldn't be that bad, but I'm posting here so I guess I was wrong.

My MIL doesn't have a job and my FIL works late shifts until around 11pm. When he gets home they will watch YouTube in the living room and play music on it at a loud volume with our speaker system, it's not ""college house party bass tearing apart the walls"" loud but it is still loud.

My kids are not light sleepers but this wakes them up, then they go wake me up because they want me to make it stop. My kids need to be rested for school and I need to get up in the morning to drop them off and go to work.

My wife works overnight shifts so she doesn't witness this.

I've tried to talk to my MIL and FIL about it and asked that they please keep the noise down after my kids' bed time which is 8:30pm. I don't expect complete silence but I really don't think they need to have the TV on loud late at night.

My FIL argued with me and said that he doesn't finish work til 11pm, so I'm basically expecting him to not do the things he enjoys after work. I told him he can do it before work or on his days off or it's tough shit.

He complained to my wife who's now taking his side and saying that the kids need to learn how to sleep through ""a bit of everyday noise"".

I told her it's not everyday noise and that he and MIL are being excessively noisy and inconsiderate, she's just not there to see it. My FIL has been sending me links to buy earplugs for the kids.

I've gotten really fed up with this. It's not my in-laws' house and they're staying with us as guests and I think they're being really selfish.

I decided to put parental controls on the TV so that my in-laws can't use it after 8:30pm, until 6am the next day. Between those times the TV can't be used without putting in the password and only I know it. This doesn't affect my wife as she doesn't get off work until 6am and isn't normally home until 6:20ish.

My FIL is now incredibly pissed off with me and said that I'm acting like a child and keeps pestering me, demanding the password. My wife is also mad at me for upsetting her dad. 

I'm just so annoyed at this whole situation and I'm sick of hearing about it so I just want to know if I'm morally in the clear.

Edit: thank you for the awards!",25848,100govo,"NTA

Everyone needs to make an effort to make a situation like this as easy as possible for everyone involved. That means being a considerate person. 
It seems as though your in-laws never learned basic manners. 

Your kids basic needs trump your FIL's wanting to watch TV at a loud volume in the middle of the night. Constantly disrupted sleep is bad for everyone, but for younger kids it's even worse. The kids shouldn't have to wear ear plugs. Your in-laws could get headphones instead.

So, good for you for drawing a line. They seem to not understand it any other way. If they continue behaving the way they have, they can look for another place to stay.",545,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100govo/aita_for_putting_parental_controls_on_my_tv_and/,"['ms', 'live', 'wife', 'fs', 'two', 'kids', 'wifes', 'parents', 'staying', 'us', 'temporarily', 'home', 'having', 'serious', 'repairs', 'freak', 'accident', 'fault', 'luckily', 'insurance', 'repairs', 'completed', 'two', 'months', 'really', 'get', 'along', 'in-laws', 'especially', 'father-in-law', 'agreed', 'let', 'stay', 'because', 'thought', 'time', 'would', 'fly', 'bad', 'im', 'posting', 'guess', 'was', 'wrong', 'mil', 'job', 'fil', 'works', 'late', 'shifts', 'around', 'pm', 'gets', 'home', 'watch', 'youtube', 'living', 'room', 'play', 'music', 'loud', 'volume', 'speaker', 'system', 'its', 'college', 'house', 'party', 'bass', 'tearing', 'apart', 'walls', 'loud', 'still', 'loud', 'kids', 'light', 'sleepers', 'this', 'wakes', 'go', 'wake', 'because', 'want', 'make', 'stop', 'kids', 'need', 'rested', 'school', 'need', 'get', 'morning', 'drop', 'go', 'work', 'wife', 'works', 'overnight', 'shifts', 'witness', 'this', 'ive', 'tried', 'talk', 'mil', 'fil', 'asked', 'please', 'keep', 'noise', 'kids', 'bed', 'time', 'pm', 'expect', 'complete', 'silence', 'really', 'think', 'need', 'tv', 'loud', 'late', 'night', 'fil', 'argued', 'said', 'finish', 'work', 'til', 'pm', 'im', 'basically', 'expecting', 'things', 'enjoys', 'work', 'told', 'before', 'work', 'his', 'days', 'its', 'tough', 'shit', 'complained', 'wife', 'whos', 'taking', 'his', 'side', 'saying', 'kids', 'need', 'learn', 'sleep', 'bit', 'everyday', 'noise', 'told', 'its', 'everyday', 'noise', 'mil', 'being', 'excessively', 'noisy', 'inconsiderate', 'shes', 'see', 'fil', 'has', 'sending', 'links', 'buy', 'earplugs', 'kids', 'ive', 'gotten', 'really', 'fed', 'this', 'its', 'in-laws', 'house', 'theyre', 'staying', 'us', 'guests', 'think', 'theyre', 'being', 'really', 'selfish', 'decided', 'put', 'parental', 'controls', 'tv', 'in-laws', 'cant', 'use', 'pm', 'next', 'day', 'times', 'tv', 'cant', 'used', 'without', 'putting', 'password', 'only', 'know', 'this', 'affect', 'wife', 'get', 'work', 'normally', 'home', 'ish', 'fil', 'incredibly', 'pissed', 'said', 'im', 'acting', 'like', 'child', 'keeps', 'pestering', 'demanding', 'password', 'wife', 'also', 'mad', 'upsetting', 'dad', 'im', 'annoyed', 'this', 'whole', 'situation', 'im', 'sick', 'hearing', 'want', 'know', 'im', 'morally', 'clear', 'edit', 'thank', 'awards']",ms live wife fs two kids wifes parents staying us temporarily home having serious repairs freak accident fault luckily insurance repairs completed two months really get along in-laws especially father-in-law agreed let stay because thought time would fly bad im posting guess was wrong mil job fil works late shifts around pm gets home watch youtube living room play music loud volume speaker system its college house party bass tearing apart walls loud still loud kids light sleepers this wakes go wake because want make stop kids need rested school need get morning drop go work wife works overnight shifts witness this ive tried talk mil fil asked please keep noise kids bed time pm expect complete silence really think need tv loud late night fil argued said finish work til pm im basically expecting things enjoys work told before work his days its tough shit complained wife whos taking his side saying kids need learn sleep bit everyday noise told its everyday noise mil being excessively noisy inconsiderate shes see fil has sending links buy earplugs kids ive gotten really fed this its in-laws house theyre staying us guests think theyre being really selfish decided put parental controls tv in-laws cant use pm next day times tv cant used without putting password only know this affect wife get work normally home ish fil incredibly pissed said im acting like child keeps pestering demanding password wife also mad upsetting dad im annoyed this whole situation im sick hearing want know im morally clear edit thank awards 
AITA for not wanting to celebrate my mom on MY birthday?,"I have three siblings between the ages of 10 and 18. I'm the oldest fourth at 25. Every year on every single one of our birthday, we're expected to celebrate my mom as well. We've done it since we were little. It was taught to me as 'giving thanks for carrying + giving birth to us'. Which I'm all for, I am grateful as we wouldn't be here without her. The issue is though, it becomes less of our birthday and more-so an anniversary for the day our mom gave birth.

Every year on our birthday our mom gets gifts too. As we got older, we're now expected to get her monetary gifts (and not cards, or homemade stuff). Just recently was my birthday and I was gifted some much needed clothes and dishware for my new apartment. My dad however got my mom a new macbook. My siblings all got her gifts too. My youngest brother isn't expected to give much, but my 16 year old sister and 18 year old 2nd brother work so they're expected to give gifts too. My sister pulled me aside before my birthday and said she was sorry she couldn't get me much (she got me a sweater, I love it!) and that she wanted to get me more but our mom was pressuring her to get a certain necklace for our mom. Apparently my mom had been dropping hints for month and my sister was worried our mom would be upset and feel underappreciated if she didn't get it.

I asked how much it was, and my sister said it was $300. I honestly lost it on our mom and chewed into her later that afternoon when my mom opened her gifts after me. I think she's ridiculous for even wanting my sister to spend so much on a gift! Mom started crying and my dad kicked me out. Mom won't answer calls but my aunt (mom's sister) called and said I was a POS for not respecting my mother and that I'm a selfish, narcissist child for being jealous of the gifts mom got.

I thought I was in the right, but now I don't know. It's been over two weeks and mom won't answer my calls. She's been posting on facebook inspiration quotes about letting go of the toxicity in your life, how blood doesn't equal family, and how hard it is to be a mother. Several family members (aunt, grandma, uncle, and two of my cousins) are replying to the posts and are very obviously directing vague comments at me about being a horrible daughter... Idk what to think now because of how many people are on her side :/

EDIT: Thank you for all your feedback. I think it's really eye opening and I'm going to try to find a therapist so I can unload all this fuckery. Also, thank you for the awards but you don't have to! If you'd feel inclined, I think it would be pretty cool to donate it instead to a cool charity of your choice instead.",25770,suo7nj,"NTA however your mom though. Holy crapbucket.

"AITA for calling my wife unreasonable for backing out of spending Christmas with my family after my mother rejected her cookie sample""?","
Context: For every holiday, My mother would ask the women in the family (my sisters, sister in-law, my wife, my female cousins) to send ""samples"" of the desserts they plan to bring to the celebration for testing and to see if these desserts could make it to the ""food menu"". My wife has been complaining about my mother deliberately rejecting every dessert sample she sent. So many times my mother has told her that she's being honest and keeping the guests best interest at heart. Yet my wife still thought that my mother is deliberately excluding her since 2 of her dessert samples were rejected before.



For this year's Christmas my mother is doing the same thing but this time, she told every woman who are participating to make a ""cookie sample"" and send it to her for testing. My wife took it as a challenge and to be honest she worked really hard to make a good sample and sent it to my mother days ago and the results just came in yesterday.


I came home from work and found my wife upset. I asked what's wrong and she told me that my mother rejected the sample she sent and decided to exclude her baking from the food list/menu for christmas this year. I didn't know what to say but she then told me she was backing out of the invitation to attend christmas with my family. I was stunned when I heard her make this statement. I tried to talk to her but she said ""it was done"" I called her unreasonable to decide to bail on the whole family over some cookie sample...that's just freaking crazy and quite unreasonable. We had a full on argument about it and she stated that my mother caused this but I told her that my mother is pretty serious and careful about the food she offers to the guests since we are going to have relatives coming from all sides of country. She told me to stop mentioing it.


Later I heard her cry despite telling her that her baking is amazing and people have preferences that's all.



AITA for insisting that her decision was unreasonable?


Info. If you're asking whose cookie sample made it to the menu, the answer is my sister and my 2 cousins.


Info Few things to put on here:

1. My wife wasn't the only one whose sample was rejected. We have SIL's (brother's wife) and my younger sister's.

2. My mother did not force anyone to participate, it was up to whoever wanted to take part.

3. This is just about the dessert since my mother tends to be very careful in this category but for other types of foods. Dishes/appetizers/salads/stuff like that is welcome as she stated.


Update: Great!, so I just got off the phone with my brother and he told me that his wife is doing the same thing as my wife and that she has decided to back out of the invitation to spend christmas with family as well. Turns out my wife must've told her about her decision and she decided to follow her lead. My brother is pissed saying my wife is encouraging his wife to do this. I see that the problem has just gotten bigger now. Who knows, my younger sister might join in and decide not to go as well. I don't know how this got out of control so quickly. I guess we'll try to have a discussion with my mother about this soon and see how it goes.",25712,z01vg2,"YTA. Your wife has been telling you for years that your mother has been *rejecting* her. She has gone out of her way to make something good and your mother's pretentious Christmas menu leaves her out every year. And now you can't understand why she's devastated and doesn't want to go to Christmas with the people who make her feel so bad. It sounds like you just said ""guess my mother just doesn't like your cooking. Deal with it"" instead of *you* dealing with your mother.

What kind of Christmas requires *samples* to be sent for *approval in advance* for the *menu*?

AITA for telling my husband I won't be cooking for him anymore because of the comment he made?,"My husband doesn't know how to cook. he also not a fan of the food I cook from my country of origins. Seeing him living off fast food motivated me to learn to cook his family's common meals. It took me a while to get it done properly but now I can cook an entire list of his favorite meals. he praises my cooking and encourages me to learn more.


While we were eating dinner at his parent's house. I had to excuse myself to go wash my hands after I was done. I left the table and my husband was still eating. as I was making my way back I heard his dad tell him to take it easy because he was eating a lot. he then asked my husband if I cook for him and if he eats well at home. My husband said that I do cook for him but the food I make can only be fed to pigs not humans. I was hurt and so offended. I showed up infront of him and told him I will no longer be cooking for him after this comment. He was turning in his seat as I walked right past him, took my purse and said I was headed home. He got back later saying it wasn't like that and that even if it was then I should be happy he still eats my food when it's still ""not perfect"" yet. He said he was trying to protect my feelings and I hurt him when I said I won't cook anymore.


EDIT ~ Hi. I'm sorry I posted this then went out. I only read few comments and felt hasitant to respond but now I'm overwhelmed. Just wanted to let you (those of you who are interested in more details) that my husband is staying with his dad right now because I didn't cook. he said he thought I overreacted and that I wasn't actually going to basically ""starve"" him by going through with my ""threat"". I told him he could stay there all he can after he said he won't be back til I go back to cooking but I don't see that happening anytime soon. He can stay there, no pressure.",25682,uixvfs,"NTA

AITA for making my stepson walk on his engagement night?,"

The title sounds bad but hear me out.


My stepson Rowan (23) just got engaged to his fiancee, she comes from a highly conservative family and they both won't live together til after Marriage. They're both on great terms and I have to say her parents are a bit much.


So the engagement party was held at a restaurant. I drove my wife, Rowan snd his best friend Jack there because Rowan's car needed some work. Things went quite well, party ended and everyone went home.


On the way back, I had to stop by the store so my could grab something for our 16 year old son. Rowan, Jack and I waited in the car. Rowan and Jack kept laughing then this young lady walked towards us cause her car was parked next to mine in the parking lot. Rowan kept trying to speak to her while she was trying to load her stuff in the car. he and jack kept throwing words at her and she sermed annoyed. Jack then said ""hey, he just wants to look at that a**"" then Rowan said ""Let me see it jiggle, baby"" I was appalled, I told them both to knock it off but then Rowan satcastically replied ""Relax I was just giving her a compliment, bet she don't get many of those often"". The lady got in her car and I started arguing with him about his behavior and shamed him for acting like this on his own engagement night. He argued back saying something about my car and I lost it. I told him to get out immediately, Jack got involved so I kicked him out too. My wife got back and started engaging in the argument sayingI can't let her son walk home from his emgagement party, I replied that her son can't be harrassing other women on the way back from his engagement party but she kept defending him. I told her to either stay or get in the car. She did and I drove off.


Rowan didn't come home and my wife gave me hell for it. we later found out that he was staying at one of his guy friends place. From what I understand, he's pissed at me and refusing to see me. My wife said it was my fault, I escalated the situation ober some stupid shit boys his age do all the time. I told her he can't do this while in my car but she took it as in I was holding it over his head. She said I should've never made him walk the night his engagement and demanded that I apologize to him.

He was sexually harassing a woman and that is never right. You stood up for your beliefs and women, sadly your wife seems to give him a pass on his behavior and it's likely why he acted like that. He has no respect for women, it appears.

AITA for refusing to sell my horse?,"Me(24f) and my boyfriend (26) have been dating for around ~9 months. 

I’ve been riding horses since around four years old when I started taking lessons. When I was ten I started helping out this girl at the stable with her horse Lady. At 12 she told her she had to sell due to time/interest and asked if me and my parents wanted to buy Lady. Luckily for me, my parents were able to buy her and she’s been mine ever since. She’s my bestest friend and I love her a lot.

When I started to date my bf I was very honest with the fact that my horse takes a lot of time and he was fine with this. When single I could spend like three to four hours a day in the stable but as we started dating I cut this down. To about three hours every other day as this is roughly how long it takes for me to do all the cleaning/preparing food/riding. Also most of my friends are at the stable which obviously means this is also social for me. The other days I would not ride and try to spend less time talking which would make it about an hour. After about six months he told me I spent too much time at the stable and I should prioritise my relationship more and somehow his family got involved and saying it was strange to prioritize the way I did. I wasn’t comfortable with this but I am a bit of a pushover so I agreed. 

At first this meant cutting down time at the stable but it has evolved into cutting down riding days. Now I ride about two days a week and the rest I’m simply there to do the basics. All of this as quickly as I can because otherwise I know he’ll be annoyed and pissed of for days and give me the silent treatment. I know my horse isn’t really suffering from not being ridden as often as before but I still feel very guilty that I’m always rushing around her.

Then last night he told me it was time to sell Lady. I laughed at him and asked if he was serious. He was. I told him no and he said I needed to start prioritizing this relationship more and I said I’ve done nothing but prioritize this relationship. We argued about it and he apparently thinks I can just put her down as she’s old anyways. I was furious at this and told him that was absolutely not happening and I would never sell her. He said that any reasonable person would sell or put down their horse in favor of their boyfriend and the only reason I wouldn’t is because I only hang out with other insane horse people. 

So I come to you, reasonable people of Reddit, AITA?

Edit: So I never expected this to get as much attention as it did. I’m very overwhelmed and thankful for all your kind comments and messages. I am currently sitting with Lady in her stable crying my eyes out because this has been such a wake-up call for me. My boyfriend left to visit his family and friends in his old town earlier today before I posted so for everyone worried: all is well for now and I will handle this asap. First I need to go home and sleep. Thank you all for being wonderful ❤️

AITA for screaming at & banning my SIL & niece from my home after they DESTROYED my houseplants?,"**EDIT** PLEASE STOP SENDING ME CHAT MESSAGES I cannot keep up with ALL of the stuff I'm seeing. **YES EVEN IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY ""I KNOW YOU SAID DON'T MESSAGE ME BUT...**

Years ago I got really into houseplants and started to collect them. Over the years Ive had up to 70, but whittled my collection down to about 35, just the ones I really love.

My niece Jenny (14F) has developed an interest in plants and will come over and we will talk about them and she helps with propagation and repotting. 

I had to go out of town for two weeks to take care of some work stuff so I asked SIL and Jenny if they could plant sit for me. I told Jenny I would pay but also give her a few cuttings as a trade off.

They agreed and when they came over I gave a tour and explained the care needed, and also showed off a few prized plants. SIL asked how much a few of them ran me and I did share. This didn't seem weird bc the family knows and Ive gotten some plants as gifts.

Well I returned from my trip and was horrified. They watered and gave the right amount of light, but they also decided to give a lot of my plants haircuts. Big ones.

My prized cebu blue pothos mother plant was destroyed. The climbing one too. My manjula pothos had been done the same. My golden that I trained up my stairwell. My string of pearls, hearts, and ruby necklace all destroyed. My silver stripe philodendron.

The worst was that my pink princess philo had been reduced to two leaves. And my albo monstera is down to three. I don't even think they got nodes necessarily. These plants are expensive and prized. 

I basically broke down and when they came to meet me to give back my key I screamed and screamed at them. Jenny started crying saying I said I would give her cuttings so she thought it was okay. I screamed at her to go home and get what she stole from me and bring it back NOW because SHE KNEW I DIDN'T MEAN SHE COULD DESTROY MY FUCKING PLANTS

SIL got between us and said ""what's done is done

**im sorry i don't know why my one edit is gone!! AHHH and half the original post. please read my comments!!**

I said no way, you're returning EVERYTHING
Jenny said ""Mom already sold most of them on marketplace""
I lost it and just screamed and screamed at them until Jenny was crying and her mom got in my face and told me I was having a tantrum over plants. I told her to get the fuck out of my house and don't EVER come anywhere near me or my home again. I called my brother (SIL husband) and he was shocked and said they told him I said it was all okay.
He brought me the stuff she hadn't sold yet and apologized. I told him I never ever want either of them in the same room as me again, they're horrible, AWFUL, irredeemable people and that I hope they both burn in hell where they belong. He told me he gets that I'm upset but that I'm taking it too far and that family means not holding grudges.
I told him to leave, and I cried for the rest of the day. I am posting because I need to know if my edict is over the top and if I'm overreacting.
So AITA for telling them that they are NO LONGER WELCOME in my home and not even wanting them in the SAME ROOM?",25604,tkcl5b,"NTA

I KNOW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PLANTS

You need to update your post. 
An albo cutting sells for 325 where I live. 
Your niece was manipulated by your SIL. Your SIL needs to give you back the money she made off YOUR plants.

People saying these are just plants, let’s replace this with that story where that guy glued those LEGO’s together, people were raging. Those plants are actually expensive.

Again, you need to include the price of one cutting.

AITA for watching and not doing anything while my wife was being kicked out of my company?,"


Hear me out, just read the whole text.


So my wife, F (26) and I, M (33) been married for 2 years. I admit that she is a hothead and can be a bit much especially when shes mad at me. I take responsibility for any mistake j make like not cleaning the bathroom after the shower or filling her car with gas after using it. I even stand there and let her unload her anger and frustration on me BUT only at home and not in public. She tends to start arguing with me in public instead of waiting til we get home. 

Recently she's been coming to my workplace to berate me over something I did the night before like not getting the stuff I said I would get or doing the stuff I said I would do. It's embarrassing and humiliating,iating and has been affecting my job to the point where I started getting a warning after a warning from my superiors who, I believe have been very patient and understanding especially when my wife makes a fuss at the office.


Last week I was in the middle of a 2hr meeting and next thing I knew was seeing my wife barge in while yelling at me asking why I was keeping my phone turned off (I had to turn it off after getting warnings about I since she forbid me from turning it off). I was stunned, because my superior and co workers AND potential clients were there. I didn't even move my superior dealt with it and called security to get her out. My wide started arguing with him telling him she came for me then started urging me to get off my seat and tell them to back off. But I didn't I just watched as security escorted her out. It was horrible because I had a fear that my job was lost. She yelled at me repeatedly to get them to stop but she got kicked out eventually. 

I got told she's no longer allowed there and that this was going to be my final, last warning. I apologized then went home. She was there waiting then yelled about me watching and doing nothing whole she was getting mistreated and kicked out. I finally snapped and said she was over the line, made a scene that risked my job over few missed calls.

AITA for taking an Uber to a wedding so I wouldn't be late?,"My sister got married last weekend.  I flew into town and my parents insisted that I stay with them instead of a hotel like I wanted.  

My parents are consistently late for everything.  I think it's a Latin thing.  I hate being late.  I think it's disrespectful.  

The wedding was at 2:30.  My folks live about half an hour from the church.  

Noon rolls up and my folks aren't even getting ready yet.  

They are adults and I am over dealing with them. 

I get ready. I send for an Uber and I am at the church for 2:00. 

I check in with my sister.  She asks me if I had any problems getting my parents to church. I told her that I came by myself.  Shebw my white and said that I was responsible for getting them there on time.  

Well nobody asked me to do that.  I didn't even want to stay there.  

So now everyone starts calling my parents.  They are getting ready.  

They were about 35 minutes late.  

The service was shortened because there was another wedding later that day.  

Everyone is still mad at me for not getting my parents there on time.  My aunt said that I'm an asshole for messing up the timing of the wedding. 

My mom says it's my fault for not reminding them to get ready.

AITA for refusing my to buy my fiancé gaming laptop for a few grand after he told me to find a real job?,"My fiancé (m37) and I (f30) have started living together 6 months ago. I own a house and he moved in with me. I run online business from home which allows me to live rather comfortably. 
A month after moving in, he quit his job saying how much he hated it and that he’s going to try and do twitch streaming for a living. 
Im all for following your passion so I was supportive although surprised at the turn of events. I am in financial position to support us both but it felt off.

Anyway, nothing happened with his twitch channel. Sure, he’s gaming all day but hasn’t bothered to even try and create an account, he just games for pleasure. It’s been 7 months. 
I’ve had conversations with him suggesting he finds work but he keeps telling me that I’m unsupportive and he needs time.

He wanted us to buy a bigger house together but I said that I’m fine with my current one and that since he doesn’t have a job, I don’t want to get mortgage and be left with paying everything and he told me that if I found a real job maybe I wouldn’t have financial problems.
We had a massive argument that night.
Now, he’s been hinting at needing new gaming laptop which costs a few grand and I’ve been ignoring it so he asked outright for me to buy it for his birthday.

I told him no that my fake job doesn’t cover new laptops and he got really pissed at me, telling me I’m selfish and am ruining his career.
Granted, I can afford it to buy it but he really hurt me saying my business is not a real job despite me working my ass off.

AITA? for refusing to sign anything while my eyes are blindfolded?,"


Eversince I got out of the hospital for chronic problems, My husband has been introducing me to some games every evening. One game used to be about doing things while my eyes are blindfolded. involving puzzles, ruby's cube, shaped objects et cetra.... We'd take turns to do it just for entertainment.



Just a couple of days ago, he's been trying to get me to sign papers while wearing a blind fold. I refused to do it because he never lets me take a look at what I'm signing neither before or after. He says that he was just trying to see if I could leave the same signature everytime I sign but I couldn't help feel uncomfortable. I told him I don't want to play this game unless and until he shows me the papers first, he said ""nevermind then"" and stopped bringing it up.


Last night, he tried to convince me to give it a try and even volunteered to go first, I asked if he was going to show me what I was going to sign and he made a face and said no, it's the rules and I should respect them. I refused and he kept on about how I keep acting worried and suspicious for no reason. he said I clearly don't trust him and he was hurt by finding that out now after everything we been through. We had an argument and I told him to drop it and not bring it up again, period. He was mad despite saying it was no big deal, he was obviously upset with me and kept talking about how I don't trust him and that I was out of line to assume or suspect anything from him like this. I might be paranoid but I couldn't help it. I do think I was ta to him after he stood by my side when my own family didn't even visit.",25535,sx8jum,"NTA. This is fucking creepy.

AITA for getting my boyfriend arrested,"Edit 8/21: I did leave a comment with an update for those who wanted to know



I’ll just get straight to it. I’m a college student and this is my last semester until medical school. I’ve never been able to get a loan I’ve worked 5 1/2 years to get this degree because I have to pay out of pocket so it takes way longer. I’ve worked two sometimes three jobs at a time and barely had a social life. For this upcoming semester I reached my goal for tuition so I quit one of my jobs so I could relax a bit. I was a server/bartender at two bars and an office job so I always have cash hidden in my apartment in my closet in box and before the semester starts a week or two before I deposit it so I can pay my tuition. My boyfriend sometimes stays over while I’m there or when I’m not. Since I’ve been saving for this semester he’s the only one who’s been over I’ve never told him about the box but he knows I have to pay for school. Well yesterday night I get home to put money in the box because I was gonna deposit it today and it’s all gone. I freaked out and tore my apartment up thinking I put it somewhere else knowing I didn’t. I called my boyfriend like crazy no answer. I didn’t sleep last night I was panicking. Then this morning he finally calls me back I’m yelling at him about my money he’s acting all confused and like I’m crazy. He comes over I’m still pissed off after a while he finally admits he took it so he can borrow and he’ll pay me back. Where tf is he gonna get $14,000 from in two weeks?! I went into a rage and called the police and reported a theft because that is what he did. Well it’s been hours now I guess he got his phone call because his family has been blowing my phone up and his mother has said some really hurtful and racist things to me. They’ve been harassing me for the past 6 hours now it’s stressing me out even more and I hate that I’m feeling bad for him but he stole my money that I’ve been saving for months. His brother did call and he was respectful and said they’ll help him pay it back and I should just go to the police station with him and tell them I want to drop the charges but I really don’t believe them. I could do that and never get my money back still. I don’t know what to do and I hate that I’m contemplating doing this. I’m just really pissed off and have been crying all fucking day.",25503,w4p8lg,"Hi everyone,

Sorry I kept you all hanging for a while but it’s been a long and annoying process. I want to thank all of you so so much for all the advice. Someone suggested when I go to school talk to my emergency dean and I am so grateful for you! With the police report I was able to get my school to pay for my semester again to that person thank you thank you thank you. I started a week late but a week late is better then not going. Sadly the harassment continued and escalated and due to what almost happened and all the text and calls I was able to get a temporary restraining order on his mom which she quickly violated smh. After a few weeks I was able to get a little bit over $8k back from my money and his brother did pay the remaining back to me (don’t worry everyone we didn’t meet it was through a third party). Also like most of you said depending on the state you can’t drop charges after the fact so I couldn’t do anything after the money was given back at this point it’s up the court what happens. We haven’t spoken nor do I care to. I’m finally moving in a month which is a huge stress reliever because they won’t know where I live anymore, a police report helps with a lot of things I got to break my lease thank God! Also won’t keep my money home anymore. Thankfully since this is my last semester I won’t have to work my bar jobs anymore so no more money in my closet. I think that’s all I have to update you all on.

AITA for refusing my future sister in law's request to dye my hair for my brother's wedding?,"My future SIL Liz has turned into a bridezilla and is going to war with everyone over every stupid thing.

My natural color is red. I love my hair. Liz is a blonde but she loves to have red hair and in fact ever since meeting me she's been dying her hair almost exactly my color. I don't mind, I think it's weird that she does it but I don't have a monopoly over this particular shade of red and she's free to do with her hair whatever she wants.

Well, she asked me this week that I should dye my hair to a different color because she wants her hair to be unique in her wedding, she offered to cover all the costs as well. I just said no because it's my hair, I don't want it changed.

I told my brother and he told me to do whatever I want because it's my hair, he said he'll talk to Liz to get her to back off. Well it didn't work because Liz has come to my parents and they've taken her side! They say it's her special day and we need to be more accomodating and it's important for our future relationship that we get along. I believe I am accomodating, she can do whatever she wants with her own hair! How is my hair any of her business anyway.

My parents tell me that I should be the bigger person. I don't know why an 18 year old should be the bigger person compared to the 27 year old Liz. They told me I'm making this minor issue into a big problem and I should just do what she wants because it's her wedding.

"AITA for ""demanding"" my GF to change her dress for a wedding?","This happened during this weekend, me being in my early thirties and my gf in her late twenties. I was invited to a wedding ceremony of a colleague and could bring someone with me. I asked my GF that I've been dating for a year if she would like to join me and she was really happy because she apparently loves weddings. Since we don't live together I drove to pick her up so we'd have some time to spare before the ceremony.

As she comes out she looks really beautiful and has obviously put in time to fix her hair and make-up. She's also wearing an off-white dress that was rather ornate. As she got in I told her that she looked stunning, but I asked if she could change to a different colored dress for the ceremony. I'm not one for etiquette by far, but one of the few things I have heard everywhere is that you should not wear a white dress to a wedding unless you're the bride. She became pretty upset and wanted to know what was wrong with her dress. I said that it would be inappropriate to wear a white or off-white dress unless you're the bride - and that it's like wedding-law or something, trying to be lighthearted about it. She rolled her eyes and said that it was an outdated tradition about women and virginity and that when her friends got married everyone wore white and that it's not a big thing anymore.

I told her that I don't know what the dress code is for this ceremony, but since it's not saying ""all white clothes"" I still thought she should change to another color but white or ""almost-white"" - because my colleague was getting married and we had no idea how she felt about it. My gf became really upset and told me that I was trying to control what she was wearing and that it was abusive, which honestly made me really upset and hurt. I said something along the lines of ""Fuck, well you shouldn't go to a wedding with an abuser then"" and then I told her to fuck off out of my car. She began to cry and wanted to apologize and give me a hug, but I just told her to get out, which she did (EDIT: To clarify we never left the driveway by her home, I did not drop her off in the middle of nowhere or anything like that).
    
I drove off and she called and texted me a bunch. I answered ""I don't want to talk right now"" and then turned my phone off and attended the ceremony. The bride was the only one that was wearing white so I feel as if my gut feeling was the right one. When I got home my phone had blown up by texts from her and her best friend saying that I was being inconsiderate and controlling and should apologize for my behavior. I've vented to a few friends - most of them agreeing with me but some have said that it was an asshole thing to tell her that she could not wear her dress - because it had nothing to do with me. I feel as if I was in the right since it was my colleagues wedding and it was better to be safe than sorry, but I'm also not sure if I was being an asshole about the situation. So, reddit AITA?

I am incredibly thankful for all of you that have reached out and commented, and I really really appreciate that you've taken the time to tell me. My GF found out about the thread (don't know if she knew my handle, or just found it) and we talked over the phone. She apologized and I apologized and it was a pretty good talk. She asked if she could come over, and I said no and that it would be best for us to go our separate ways. She got upset and asked why I wouldn't even try to work it out. I basically just said good bye and then she said my dick was small which actually made me laugh after what had been a pretty mature conversation and then she hung up. I'm pretty sad about it, she really made me feel happy but as many of you have commented - if this was our first disagreement and she called me abusive how would future disagreements look? I was hurt, but if she did think I was being abusive, it would be the right thing to do, and if she did not think I was being abusive and said it anyways I would not want to be with her. So anyways I think things worked out for the best for us both. Again thank you all, and I will keep trying to respond to all of you, but there are a lot off messages but I read through them all!",25435,t91j0c,NTA - I’m suspicious of her motives here because EVERYONE knows you don’t wear white to a wedding.,4087,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t91j0c/aita_for_demanding_my_gf_to_change_her_dress_for/,"['this', 'happened', 'during', 'this', 'weekend', 'being', 'early', 'thirties', 'gf', 'late', 'twenties', 'was', 'invited', 'wedding', 'ceremony', 'colleague', 'could', 'bring', 'someone', 'asked', 'gf', 'ive', 'dating', 'year', 'would', 'like', 'join', 'was', 'really', 'happy', 'because', 'apparently', 'loves', 'weddings', 'since', 'live', 'together', 'drove', 'pick', 'wed', 'time', 'spare', 'before', 'ceremony', 'comes', 'looks', 'really', 'beautiful', 'has', 'obviously', 'put', 'time', 'fix', 'hair', 'make-up', 'shes', 'also', 'wearing', 'off-white', 'dress', 'was', 'rather', 'ornate', 'got', 'told', 'looked', 'stunning', 'asked', 'could', 'change', 'different', 'colored', 'dress', 'ceremony', 'im', 'one', 'etiquette', 'far', 'one', 'things', 'heard', 'everywhere', 'wear', 'white', 'dress', 'wedding', 'unless', 'youre', 'bride', 'became', 'pretty', 'upset', 'wanted', 'know', 'was', 'wrong', 'dress', 'said', 'would', 'inappropriate', 'wear', 'white', 'off-white', 'dress', 'unless', 'youre', 'bride', '-', 'its', 'like', 'wedding-law', 'something', 'trying', 'lighthearted', 'rolled', 'eyes', 'said', 'was', 'outdated', 'tradition', 'women', 'virginity', 'friends', 'got', 'married', 'everyone', 'wore', 'white', 'its', 'big', 'thing', 'anymore', 'told', 'know', 'dress', 'code', 'this', 'ceremony', 'since', 'its', 'saying', 'white', 'clothes', 'still', 'thought', 'change', 'another', 'color', 'white', 'almost-white', '-', 'because', 'colleague', 'was', 'getting', 'married', 'idea', 'felt', 'gf', 'became', 'really', 'upset', 'told', 'was', 'trying', 'control', 'was', 'wearing', 'was', 'abusive', 'honestly', 'made', 'really', 'upset', 'hurt', 'said', 'something', 'along', 'lines', 'fuck', 'well', 'go', 'wedding', 'abuser', 'told', 'fuck', 'car', 'began', 'cry', 'wanted', 'apologize', 'give', 'hug', 'told', 'get', 'edit', 'clarify', 'never', 'left', 'driveway', 'home', 'drop', 'middle', 'nowhere', 'anything', 'like', 'drove', 'called', 'texted', 'bunch', 'answered', 'want', 'talk', 'right', 'turned', 'phone', 'attended', 'ceremony', 'bride', 'was', 'only', 'one', 'was', 'wearing', 'white', 'feel', 'gut', 'feeling', 'was', 'right', 'one', 'got', 'home', 'phone', 'blown', 'texts', 'best', 'friend', 'saying', 'was', 'being', 'inconsiderate', 'controlling', 'apologize', 'behavior', 'ive', 'vented', 'friends', '-', 'agreeing', 'said', 'was', 'asshole', 'thing', 'tell', 'could', 'wear', 'dress', '-', 'because', 'nothing', 'feel', 'was', 'right', 'since', 'was', 'colleagues', 'wedding', 'was', 'better', 'safe', 'sorry', 'im', 'also', 'sure', 'was', 'being', 'asshole', 'situation', 'reddit', 'aita', 'update', 'never', 'expected', 'this', 'thread', 'get', 'this', 'many', 'replies', 'incredibly', 'thankful', 'reached', 'commented', 'really', 'really', 'appreciate', 'youve', 'taken', 'time', 'tell', 'gf', 'found', 'thread', 'know', 'knew', 'handle', 'found', 'talked', 'phone', 'apologized', 'apologized', 'was', 'pretty', 'good', 'talk', 'asked', 'could', 'come', 'said', 'would', 'best', 'us', 'go', 'separate', 'ways', 'got', 'upset', 'asked', 'why', 'even', 'try', 'work', 'basically', 'said', 'good', 'bye', 'said', 'dick', 'was', 'small', 'actually', 'made', 'laugh', 'pretty', 'mature', 'conversation', 'hung', 'im', 'pretty', 'sad', 'really', 'made', 'feel', 'happy', 'many', 'commented', '-', 'this', 'was', 'first', 'disagreement', 'called', 'abusive', 'would', 'future', 'disagreements', 'look', 'was', 'hurt', 'think', 'was', 'being', 'abusive', 'would', 'right', 'thing', 'think', 'was', 'being', 'abusive', 'said', 'anyways', 'would', 'want', 'anyways', 'think', 'things', 'worked', 'best', 'us', 'thank', 'keep', 'trying', 'respond', 'lot', 'messages', 'read']",this happened during this weekend being early thirties gf late twenties was invited wedding ceremony colleague could bring someone asked gf ive dating year would like join was really happy because apparently loves weddings since live together drove pick wed time spare before ceremony comes looks really beautiful has obviously put time fix hair make-up shes also wearing off-white dress was rather ornate got told looked stunning asked could change different colored dress ceremony im one etiquette far one things heard everywhere wear white dress wedding unless youre bride became pretty upset wanted know was wrong dress said would inappropriate wear white off-white dress unless youre bride -

AITA for yelling at my husband and telling him to get over himself after he threw away my tampon box?,"
We (Me 27, him 30) together for 3, married for 2 months.


So here's a thing, I used to use pads for my periods but recently was able to start using tampons (I have medical problems) in comparison, Tampons work 10x better for me, especially when I'm outside...say like at work or traveling. My husband Ryan hates them, he never truely gave a reason other than just say...he doesn't feel comfortable with *me* using *them* . I didn't think it was a big deal at first since he said he hates a lot of stuff that I do but ""puts up"" with it anyway except for this. He asked that I go back to using pads but I made it clear since it's my body then I get to decide.


He threw away some tampons he had access to, and I was getting upset but*!!!!* to keep the peace, I just bought a box and hid it away from him. he somehow found it and threw it away. I didn't find that out til I had my period yesterday and realized I had no tampons to use. I was tired, and too stressed I just yelled at him after he admitted to throwing away the whole box. He argued that I already knew how he felt about *this stuff* and yet I decided to still *keep it around*. I lost it and told him he had no right to do this and told him to get over himself already. He stared at me almost about to tear up or something, then walked out.


He later went on about how we, as a couple should take each other's discomfert into consuderation and said he already tried to speak to me about those tampons yet I brushed him off and insulted him and verbally abused him. He also said that if I still insist on using them then I should do it while I'm outside the house but I said that it won't happen. I feel bad for how it played out but I was just at my wet's end and in so much pain I lashed out.

AITA for not attending my husband's celebration dinner due to the restaurant not having anything I could eat?,"My husband has been working really hard the last two years to advance at his company and he finally got the promotion he's been after. I'm really, really proud of him. His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat.

He suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu.

AITA?

Update: Some of these comments were pretty harsh but a kick in the pants.

AITA for banning my MIL from the house after I discovered that she's installed a camera in the bedroom?,"

My husband (M33) got into a car accident almost a month ago, He's been bedridden due to a back injury and I've been his primary caregiver. The pressure has been too much from my MIL, she keeps telling me to take care of him and be there for him constantly. She begged me to take time of work and I did, asked me to send her hourly updates about his condition (first 2 weeks) but when I don't she'd get mad and cause an issue. She visits everyday but doesn't do anything to help, alternatively, she'd list all the things I should or shouldn't do. The family keeps telling me she's just worried sick for her son so I try to stay calm.


Days ago, she called to berate me about not replacing the sheets quickly, I had no idea how she found out since my husband didn't call her. My sister inlaw called me to tell me that her mom installed a camera in the bedroom to see if I was taking proper care of her son. I was stunned, after searching the room I found the camera, I called my MIL and had a huge fight with her. She admitted it and said she was just feeling concerned and wanted to make sure her son was being cared for (despite him calling her everyday) I yelled at her telling her that she's no longer allowed into my home after this. She lost it and went on a rant about how I'm stopping her from seeing her son and that not seeing him will literally make her sick herself. The family called me later to get me to back out of this decision but I told them she breached my privacy and took advantage of the situation, they said I'm taking it too personally and that I can't blame a concerned mother for wanting to make sure her son's fine, especially since she listed things she thought I was doing wrong. I ended the conversation but my husband is upset telling me I'm being vindictive and that if his mom can't come then he'll move there with her. We argued then I went outside and he's been silent eversince.

AITA for making my chronically late friend miss her seminar?,"My friend [25F] is constantly late for everything. Be it work-related or fun activities, she will always be at least 15-20 minute late. She does not have a car, and so oftentimes I [25M] will pick her up from her house (I work at a university and she is a PhD student there, and her place is along the way for me). 

Last time I offered her a ride to work, she ended up being 20 minutes late after I've already arrived at her place. Because of that, I ended up being late for work. She is always very apologetic about her lateness, but never changes.

This week she was supposed to give a seminar at the university which is a crucial part of her PhD program. She asked me if I could give her a ride to work that day. I told her sure, but that I was picking her up at 8 AM and she must be there exactly at 8 AM, and not a minute later. She chuckled, but I told her I wasn't joking, and she promised that she will be there. 

The morning of her seminar, I drove to her place and got there at 7:55, and texted her that I was here, and she told me should would be out in ""just a minute"". At 8:00, there was no indication that she would come out (and she didn't text anything), so at 8:01, I drove off. 

At around 8:20, she called me asking me where I was. I told her I was at work and that I wasn't joking when I told her that she had to be ready right that minute. She started screaming and crying over the phone, and told me that she was having a hard time that morning couldn't be ready right at 8 AM. She then begged me to come back to pick up her, as her seminar is at 9 AM and she needed to be at the school before then. I could've done it quick enough to pick her up and drop her off without affecting my work, but I decided I didn't want to do that, and told her that I won't. 

She was crying and hyperventilating at that point and said she'd promise to never be late for anything else again, and reemphasized that this seminar was crucial for her PhD and that she absolutely cannot miss it without severe consequence. I responded ""oh well"", and hung up. I then went about my day at work normally. 

I feel like could've went back and picked her up in this scenario since it wouldn't have been detrimental to me and at the same time this was something very important for her. On the other hand, I feel like this should be a wake-up call for her chronic lateness.

EDIT: thank you everyone for the kind words. 
To answer a few common questions:

AITA for my response after my BIL said my dress was inappropriate for a family gathering?,"
Ugh! Hear me out!


So My bil (my husband's brother) was married to a women from Greece, Her name is *""Nana""*, and the reason for their divorce was because of how much my conservative bil tried to control her cloths and the places she went. He didn't want the divorce and was hopping Nana would accept the life he offered and stay but she didn't.


This happened 2 years ago, he now moved back with my inlaws and we'd see him more often. He tried to comment on how I dress on multiple ocassions and it's unbearable. but since my inlaws said he's struggling and depressed then I let it go.

On friday my inlaws celebrated my husband's 30th birthday at their home. I wore a heart-shaped blue dress and had my hair up. While we were eating my BIL pointed at me and said that my cleavage was showing and that I shouldn't have wore this dress because it looked inappropriate for a family gathering. I was utterly shocked, everyone was staring at me and I felt so embarrassed and on the spot. He looked at me waiting for me to blow up probably but I laughed and told him ""Knock, knock! he said ""Who’s there?"", I said ""Nana"". Now he paused and seemed confused at the mention of this name. He then faked a laugh and said ""Nana who?"" I said ""Nana your goddamn business what I’m wearing! ok!"". He got upset and quickly left the table. My SILs laughed but my husband and his parents were upset and later said that I was way out of line for bringing up Nana to my BIL knowing how heartbroken and depressed he is because of her. His mom said that I was petty and didn't need to dig at him just to prove a point.

AITA for returning the shoes I got for my husband after he accused me of stealing from him?,"
My [29] husband [36] is the breadwinner of the family. I stay home with the kids who are preschool age. He pays for the mortgage, bills, household needs, food, kids needs.....etc he has set a monthly budget for each category and handles getting everything done. Recently, he has become overwhelmed and told me to handle grocery shopping but before he let me, he asked me to write a list of all the stuff we need so he could calculate the total and also so he'd have an idea how much I'll be spending when I take his credit card. I didn't have an issue with that because this way we'd watch our spending habits. however, he said I'm never allowed to get something that isn't on the list unless I'm paying for it some other way.



On friday I was doing some grocery shopping as usual and saw that the store had some nice shoes on sale. the price was insanly low for this brand and so I decided to grab a pair for my husband thinking he'd be happy with them since he needed new sneakers anyway. I bought them and when I showed them to him he flipped out on me saying I made a huge mistake by buying something that was not on the list. I agreed with him but I thought that since the shoes were for him then it'd be different, he said I screwed up and shouldn't have bought those sneakers without even telling him. but in my defense I said that the price was low so it's not like I spent $100 on shoes, and also I saw this as a great deal and wanted him to have those nice sneakers. He plainly said that what I did is considered ""stealing"" since he never consented to have those sneakers purchased and said that I'm being irresponsible with money that is why I no longer have an income and my spending habits need a ""grib"". I felt hurt by what he said. We argued about it for hours and he avoided speaking to me the rest of the day.

The next day I went and returned the sneakers and took the money back. He got home in the evening and lost it when he found out I returned them. He said he couldn't believe how petty and childish I was to do actually do this. I explained I was just correcting my ""mistake"". he tried to contact the store and was told the sneakers were already sold. He got even angrier with me but I told him that he accused me of stealing for him when I was just trying to do a nice gesture for him, He yelled that I had a lot of nerve calling what I did ""nice gesture"" while using his money to do it. I told him he had no right to yell at me after I corrected my ""mistake"" and gave back the money he accused me of stealing.


He threw a fit then went out with his friends and came home late at night still not talking to me.


Did I mess up? maybe I shouldn't have purchased them knowing they weren't on the list but I just wanted him to have those sneakers and thought I was doing a nice gesture.",25147,ugnfbn,"This is financial and emotional abuse and beyond Reddit’s pay grade.

AITA for disinviting my siblings from my wedding,"There's me (25f,) sister (27f) and brother (28m) involved here.

We were raised together and until 2019 we believed we were a nuclear biological family. Then we found out our dad wasn't our bio dad, which even he didn't know, it then turned out my older siblings shared a bio dad but I had a different one. We were also first cousins because their bio and my bio were brothers.

Dad left our mom, hurt, betrayed, and overall disgusted that she had lied to him for two decades. I was equally mad that she lied and hurt my dad. My siblings were less willing to cut her off but their relationship strained majorly.

Dad moved in with me and my then boyfriend, now fiance, and Covid hit. At this point all three of us agreed he was dad no matter what. And there was nothing that could change that.

I meant it; they didn't.

They found their bio father and mine by extension, and have decided that he is now ""real dad"" and that our dad is just a stepdad. My brother has even corrected his two little girls who called dad grandpa, into saying he's stepgrandpa and that's what they call him, while bio gets called grandpa.

It broke my dad's heart and he decided it was too much for him to accept. This is after talks between them where he was essentially told to know his place, stay in his lane and demoted with the clear message being nothing would change. I am so pissed at them. They have tried to push me to meet my ""real dad"" and have told me it's okay to go back on what we said.

Initially, they were invited to my wedding but with this whole mess I told them they were no longer welcome and I did not want them to show up. They told me that just because they have a relationship with their ""real dad"" doesn't change things between us. I told them it does. That if dad isn't our real dad after EVERYTHING he has done for us then we're not ""real siblings"", because technically we are HALF siblings and cousins. That my dad is till my dad 100% and biology is meaningless to me. And so it was best for them not to come, because I no longer want them there.

What I said hurt them. My SIL (married to my brother) told me I was an asshole for throwing half in their faces and cutting them from my wedding like we haven't been siblings our whole lives. I think that's almost more annoying to me, because that's our dad. But he can be shit on and discarded like he's nothing.

AITA for removing the bedroom lock after my husband ignored a family emergency?,"Background about my husband : He stays up late at night and has to wake up early to go to work. So when he gets home at 5, he has to get his 2hrs nap so he could both make up for lack of sleep and also be ready to stay up late to play with his console. 

He values his sleep and has one rule in the house that he enforces strictly, which is to not be interrupted while sleeping. He literally put a sign on the bedroom door saying 'DO.NOT.WAKE.ME.UP"" under any circumstances, just no, unless someone's hurt or dead though; in this case he said he still wouldn't be of much help anyway. The kids and I would sometimes wake him up but for serious reasons. He got mad and started locking the door. I get no access to the room for 2 hours but that's not the main problem.


This past tuesday, my 3yo son had hot oil spill on his hand while his 14yo sister was cooking, I heard him scream and saw that the oil was covering his hand and half of his arm, I brought the first aid kit but he was in so much pain and his skin looked really bad. I rushed to wake my husband up, I kept knocking but got no response so I tried to open it but it was locked. I spent a while between knocking on the door (he had his phone turned off) and getting dressed after my daughter asked the neighbor to drive us to the hospital. I couldn't wast more time cause my son was crying. The neighbor took us to the hospital and I couldn't help feel livid the whole time. We got home and my husband was pacing around asking wherever were and why I didn't answer his texts. I blew up on him after I showed him our son's injury and told him that I pounded on the door to wake him up but he said had his earbuds on and didn't hear a thing. I called him reckless and neglectful for ignoring a family emergency. He said I could say the same thing about myself for leaving our son unsupervised and causing him to get a burn. I stopped arguing and went to remove the bedroom door lock, he started yelling at me saying I had no right. I refusedto respond I just walked off to calm down. He didn't stop complaining calling me bossy and saying that by removing the lock I've destroyed his peace and quiet and caused him sleep deprivation. He's insisting I put it back but I refused.

AITA for refusing to move out?,I 24F have lived in the same apartment for 4 years in this time I’ve had 2 roommates one the first two years I lived here and the second for the rest of the time. My current roommate 32F (V) has been great until now. She’s in a long term relationship and over Christmas she got proposed to. Now they want to live together but they both approached me and asked me to let her fiancé take over my lease and for me to find a new place as soon as possible. I have a few problems with this I feel like they should find a new place together because I’ve lived here longer. I also told V a few months ago that I spoke to the landlord about once our lease together is up that I’ll be living alone since I can now afford it. At that time she agreed and said that her and her boyfriend would look for a place together. I told her this but she said that when they started looking for a new place that everything else was too expensive and it made for sense for me to move out and not her. I refused and told her that she can always ask the landlord if there will be units available for them in our building. She started cussing me out and has had her fiancé and their friends harassing me about it.

AITA for allowing my terminally ill daughter to smoke and drink?,"Hello, I am the (42) father to a 16 year old girl.

About 3 months ago we found out via a visit to the hospital that our daughter had a late stage form of brain cancer and were told that survival was not likely. We tried anyway, but despite our best efforts we found no improvement in the cancer. My daughter is aware of this.

Well, recently, my wife was looking for a hair straightener my daughter had borrowed and found a few grams of marijuana, an elf-bar vape, as well as a partially empty handle of Tito's Vodka in her bedroom. When confronted, my daughter confessed to have been using these substances for about a month at that point. She said that since she knew she wasn't likely going to survive past 18, she wanted to try these things socially, and assured us she was being responsible with them.

I myself am a user of these substances, as we live in a legal state. I do not vape, though I do smoke cigarettes, drink, and will occasionally roll myself a joint. While normally I would not want my children using these, I thought I could make an exception due to the circumstances. My wife, however, disagrees. She only drinks a glass of wine every now and then, and dislikes nicotine and marijuana.

We had a conversation and came to the conclusion that she would be allowed to do these things under my supervision, as long as they are from retail stores and dispensaries and not street dealers, though my wife remains adamant she should not be doing them at all.

AITA?",24925,xac2x2,"Hospice nurse chiming in.  First NTA.  Let her experience what she can while she can still enjoy it.  I'm assuming she's either got DIPG or Glio - both devastating.  Just be careful if she's taking narcotics for pain or benzos for sleep/anxiety.  The systemic depression combination of those drugs mixed with alcohol really can be a deadly combination.  2nd, try within your means to check off bucket list items for her.  It gives her goals and reasons to get out of bed in thr morning.  See if you can get her with Make A Wish.  They don't just do Disney for little kids.  3rd the MJ can help with pain and appetite.  And 4th, if she doesn't want to treat, do get her admitted to hospice services.  They can be such a help with things you don't know you need right now.  Hospice is not just for the very end.  Studies show that people on Hospice live longer than those that do not get admitted till the very end.  The goal is comfort and Quality of life.  Best wishes to your family

AITA for sneaking out of the restaurant after my fiance told me to pay for his and his friends meal?,"


I (F33) have been engaged to my fiance (M37) for 5 months. We don't share finance because that's what he wants. I got a raise on my salary. now I earn 30% more than he does and I noticed that he's been using this to ask me to pay for him and his friends. Whenever I say ""no"" or ""why should I pay for this?"" he'd respond with ""the 30% that's why"". he acts as if the 30% is unfair or that I'm not dserveing of it.


Several times he has tricked me to pay for his and his friend's meals by asking me publicly. Let me say that I'm too nice to say ""no"", I hate confrontation especially when we're at a public place like a restaurant so I just grin and pay.


Last tuesday, he asked me to join him and his buddies for dinner. I told him from the start I wasn't paying for their food and he shouldn't expect me to. He said he ""got this"" and ""no worries"".


We got to the restaurant. Met his friends, ordered food. And in the middle of the meal he leaned in and whispered that I would be paying for everything he and his friends ordered. I got so mad I whispered back ""noooo"" but he probably relied on me not causing a scene in public and infront of his friends. he said ""you have enough money you could pay for everyone's food, 30% remember?"".


I was fuming inside. instead of reacting negatively and losing my temper. I waited til the bills arrived (they were already split from the start when we first ordered) I paid for mine then I excused myself to the restroom. I then sneaked out from there, got into my car and went home.


I started getting phonecalls from my fiance then texts asking where I was. I texted back saying I didn't appreciate how he put me in this situation and basically tricking me into paying for his and his friends food. I told him I went home then stopped replying. An hour later he came and started yelling at me calling me selfish, irrational, cheapskate and childish for sneaking out like that and leaving him stuck with a bill he could not pay (He had to call his brother for help). We had a loud argument then he walked out.

His friends didn't speak to me on this but he told me they're disappointed in my behavior and are telling him to take time and ""reflect"" on the type of woman he's gonna be married to.

AITA for what I did? Is what he's expecting from me fair or justified?.

ETA: Some info:

(1) he said that because the restaurant wasn't expensive then I could have just paid.

(2) He admitted not telling me about it til later knowing I'd refuse. He still thinks my reaction was childish and unacceptable.",24898,x5036x,"Why are you still engaged to him.

You set a boundary.

He ignored it.

Then he continues to put you in situations where he assumes he can embarrass you enough that you will do what he wants.

That is absolutely horrible, and I can’t believe you are even considering that you may be the asshole here.

He is a grade A asshole, and all too happy to take advantage of you financially and pressure you into doing things you don’t want to do and trying to use social situations to manipulate you.

"AITA for kicking my sister out of our family dinner after she made a ""practical observation""?","My brother 'Fred' and his wife 'Sarah', are not very financially stable, so it was a bit of a surprise for my sister, 'Katie' and I when they announced that they were pregnant. However, we kept it to ourselves. A few months ago, Katie planned a family trip. Brother and SIL decided to opt out as they were cutting costs for the baby. At this, mom and dad decided to cancel the trip altogether and have another one later, since mom's health wasn't too great either. This greatly irked Katie as she was really looking forward to this trip and made some very unsubtle remarks that Fred and Sarah shouldn't be having children if they don't have money. This very clearly upset both of them.

Unfortunately, due to several complications, the baby was stillborn. It has been a month, and my brother and SIL are understandably still devastated. Especially my SIL's mental health is not very well as of now.

Yesterday, I hosted a little family dinner at my home, with sister, brother, SIL and our parents. Some time before dinner, SIL went to the bathroom, and meanwhile, my husband asked Fred if she was doing well. Before Fred could reply, Katie jumped in and said, ""Well, though the loss is very sad, think of this as a good thing. At least you don't have to worry about money anymore. As I said, you shouldn't be bringing kids into this world unless you are sure you can provide for them.""

Fred went red-faced and said that they WOULD have been able to provide for their child. They may not have money for extra luxuries, but they would do everything for their child. He was almost crying and purple with anger, so I quickly dragged Katie away to the kitchen and demanded what had possessed her to say something so insensitive.

She got incredibly defensive and said that she had made a very practical observation and she was 100% correct. It was better to see straight than be clouded by emotions. By that time, Sarah had come out of the bathroom and was shocked to see Fred in tears. She kept on getting hysterical and asking what was wrong. I knew that Katie's presence would ruin things further, and I asked her to get out. She looked incredibly hurt and angry, but went out anyway.

Fortunately, our parents were late and didn't have to see the whole spectacle. When they came home and found out what had happened, they were shocked and upset at Katie too, but mom thinks that perhaps I shouldn't have kicked Katie out like this. AITA?

AITA for going “bridezilla” after my bridesmaid spilled wine on my wedding dress?,"I (27 F) got married a month ago. My dress was this long, lacy gown that my mom wore at her wedding. My mom passed away about 2 years ago. 

Because the dress was so important to me, I had a big plan to keep it safe from any damages. I would only wear the dress at the wedding itself, and I would switch to a more casual dress for the reception. When I was wearing the dress, I wouldn’t eat or drink anything except water, and I would stay inside at all times.

I promise I’m not usually this crazy about cleanliness, but this was my mom’s dress, and the thought of it being damaged broke my heart. But I also knew I wanted to wear it when I got married to have a piece of her with me. She adored this dress and always dreamed I would wear it. 

My bridesmaids knew very well about my particularities with the dress. I had a room above the venue where I was getting ready. My dress was hanging in a safe place in the room. 

On the day of the wedding, I went down to check on something for the wedding, leaving my bridesmaids in the room. Here’s what happened, as they told it to me:

They opened a bottle of Pinot Noir (my favorite) as a celebration. They poured themselves glasses and began to walk around checking out the room. One of my bridesmaids, “Anna,” (27 F) wanted to get a closer look at my dress. She got really close to it, and she started touching the lace. Somehow, her hand holding the wine glass slipped, and wine spilled all over the bottom of the dress. 

When I came upstairs, they told me what happened, and I started sobbing. My maid of honor called several professional cleaners, and they said there was no way they could get the dress in before the wedding. They told us ways to save the dress until we could get it into them, so my MOH started doing that.

After that call, I became extremely angry. I asked “Anna” what the hell she was doing holding red wine so close to my dress when she knew how careful I was being. She dismissed it and said it wasn’t such a big deal because I was planning to wear the dress, so it could have gotten damaged that way too. 

I couldn’t believe she said that. I called her thoughtless and careless and stupid. I told her that she was no longer part of the wedding and that I wanted her to leave. She left, and neither of us have reached out to the other since. 

I got married in the dress I had planned to wear for the reception, and I was heartbroken not to be wearing my mom’s dress. After the wedding, my bridesmaids joked that I was a bridezilla for kicking “Anna” out after she made a “honest mistake.” 

I absolutely don’t think I’m the AH or a bridezilla because Anna’s reaction was so horrible and insincere. But I wanted to get the story off my chest and ask some people who might be more impartial, AITA?",24838,w4jwp3,"NTA at all.

AITA for banning alcohol from Christmas.,"My husbands family likes to drink. Every holiday includes multiple bottles of wine/cocktails. I hate drinking I have never drank my father was an alcoholic I think it’s childish if you can’t have fun without drinking.

This year I’m hosting Christmas for a change I decided since it’s at my house no alcohol allowed we are all getting older and it’s time to grow up.

My husbands sister called to ask what she could bring. She saw a recipe for a Christmas martini that she wanted to bring. I told her about my no alcohol rule. She didn’t say much but must have told the rest of the family. Some of them started texting me asking me if I was serious and saying that it is lame. But I’m not budging. 

Now it turns out my husbands sister is hosting an alternate gathering that almost everyone is choosing to go to instead. It’s so disrespectful all because they would have to spend one day sober. 

My husband told me he talked to his sister and we are invited to her gathering and he said we should just go and stop causing issues but I won’t it’s so rude. 

Now husband is mad because I’m making him stay home and spend Christmas with me but it was my turn to host and I chose to have a no alcohol they could have dealt with it for one year.",24742,zalhix,"INFO:. Have any past christmases/events been absolutely ruined because of alcohol?

If not, this is a pretty strange rule to implement with your husband's family. They have nothing to do with your father being an alcoholic. If my boyfriend told my mother she can't drink wine with her christmas supper I would find that weird as hell.

AITA for calling my husband unreasonable for canceling the holiday trip just because me and the kids coupdn't help him in an emergency?,"My husband and I have been together for 4 years. I have two kids (17m /19f). and their half brother is 3 years old.



this past week. My husband had an emergency (dad had a medical emergency) and wanted someone to watch our son. he asked my older son and he refused because he was going out with friends. he also asked my daughter but she locked herself in her room to study. I was at the restaurant with my brother meeting his girlfriend for the first time. My husband ended up taking our son with him to the hospital and his mom watched him from there.


He came home and was lashing out on everybody. Calling us selfish and unfeeling. I tried to explain that the kids were busy but he told me to get the f out with that bull because my older son could've skipped the hangout and watched his brother and, my daughter could've watched her brother while studying instead of locking herself in her room. He scolded me as well but I told him I couldn't leave lunch with my brother since he was visiting town and this was my only chance to meet his girlfriend.

He yelled some more than told us that he was canceling the family holiday trip for christmas this year. The two older kids were upset and said it was unfair. I called him unreasonable to cancel the trip and punish the kids (and possibly me) like that. he refused to discuss it later. Now me and the kids aren't speaking to him and he's saying ""good riddance""


*edit My husband was supposed to watch our son at the time. That's why I went to see my brother at the restaurant. The kids aren't used to watching their brother when neither parent is home.*


*update My husband just told us that he'll be spending christmas with his family saying he needs to be around his dad anyway. the kids said they will just go to their dad since they and my husband are still not talking. neither of the kids are happy with how things turned out. so I feel like things have gotten out of hand and the problem got bigger. He's now choosing to basically abandon us on christmas and also keep our son away from me and his siblings.*",24707,zbguxp,"Just to add, the 3yo is your son too.

AITA for not spending this Christmas in the hospital with my daughter?,"My (39F) daughter (16F) has had a sensitive stomach ever since she was a kid. There are certain foods that will upset her stomach to the point where she's unable to stop throwing up.

We've seen countless doctors, but so far nobody's been able to give us a clear answer. The only advice we keep getting is to identify all trigger foods and cut them from her diet. We have a pretty good idea of what those foods are: soda and other carbonated drinks, chips, cheetos, and other similar processed snacks, anything oily or fried and most sweets. Unfortunately, this is exacty the kind of stuff my daughter loves to eat the most. And as horrible as she feels after she has them, she still refuses to cut them out of her diet, which in turn led to her spending a lot of time in the hospital during the past few years.

When she was little, it was easier to keep all these foods away from her because I simply wouldn't buy them. But now that she's older, I can't always be there to check what she eats. She eats the greasy pizza at her school's cafeteria, she trades her lunch with her classmates, she goes out with her friends and stops to eat at KFC and so on. And it always ends with her in the ER, crying and shaking because she can't stop throwing up.

This was the case on this Christmas eve as well, when our whole family gathered at our place. And of course, among the many dishes at our Christmas table were some of her main trigger foods, like chips, soda, chocolate and sweets. Now mind you, these were far from the only foods available to her. We also had a variety of home-cooked, traditional dishes on the table, with ingredients that don't upset her stomach, like vegetables, meat, dairy etc. All of them delicious and well-seasoned - my daughter herself says she really likes most of these dishes. 

Despite this, my daughter chose to eat nothing but her trigger foods. I reminded her that they'd make her feel awful, but she said she didn't care, because *Christmas is only once a year* and she *just wants to live a little*. Well, this ended with her violently throwing up in the ER a few hours later. She had to be hospitalized for a few days and only just got out of the hospital a few hours ago.

And unlike all the previous times when something like this happened, this time I chose to spend my Christmas relaxing at home with the rest of our family, and not in the hospital by my daughter's side. I kept in touch with her through calls and texts, and told her that if she needed anything I'd ask a family member to bring it to her, but I made it clear that I would not be visiting her during her stay.

And well, my daughter didn't take this too well. She cried every time we talked on the phone, begged me to come over, told me how horrible I was for 'abandoning' her there all alone and so on. Most of our family didn't take my side in this either, and during the past few days I got called everything from 'a little extreme' to downright cruel and heartless.

AITA for saying I won’t coddle my infertile sister any more?,"My sister “Julie” has tried to have a baby for 5 years. She had a miscarriage 2 years ago and outside that, has been unable to get pregnant. My heart hurts for her. However, one thing I don’t agree with is how my family has handled it. We’re not allowed to talk about babies around Julie. Any kids younger than 3 can’t come to family events that she’ll attend. She won’t attend baby showers, baptisms, etc. The last one I understand, but the rest feels overkill. 

I got pregnant last year. I told Julie first and she reiterated her boundaries. I said I understood. The first hurdle came with my baby shower. My MIL was throwing it. I didn’t expect Julie to come. Then my mom told me I shouldn’t have one period, “out of respect”. I said that was ridiculous. She didn’t have to come so what did it matter? Only 3 people from my side of the family came to the shower.

When my son was born, I posted a birth announcement on Facebook. My parents lectured me for this and said it was going to hurt Julie. I said she could just block or mute me. They said I should make the effort. Julie echoed that if I cared, I’d stop. I ended up blocking her just to save drama. 

My aunt’s 70th birthday party is next week. My husband and I planned to go, bringing our son. Julie called and asked if we were going. She then asked for me to get a sitter for our son. I said no. She doesn’t want to miss the party. My aunt is one of the few people who agree that Julie’s boundaries aren’t fair and wants my son there, as she doesn’t get to see him often. Julie got upset and started crying, saying that I was unfair. 

I finally snapped and asked what would happen when she got pregnant? Would we all be expected to shower her with the love and attention she’s refused to give other people’s kids? Will her baby be allowed to attend events? She said that was different. I said no, I’m not coddling her anymore. My son exists, he’s family and he’s coming. She can decide if she wants to or not.

My parents yelled at me for being mean to Julie. They offered to pay for a sitter but I said no. It’s not even her house. AITA?",24710,xcj282,"NTA

Good lord. Wow. She's trying to cut off all family event related contact for your side of the family?

She needs therapy badly. That's just so unfair to you and your child and the other relatives who do want to see the baby.

AITA for telling my ex his lack of money is not my issue?,"I (36F) have a daughter Sadie (12) with my ex-husband John (39). We got divorced 5 years ago and I have primary custody while he sees her two weekends a month. Last year, he got married to Amanda who has sole custody of her kids (10&8F) from a previous marriage. Amanda is a SAHM (not for any health reasons or so on, she just doesn't want to work) while John works at a 9 to 5. He makes good money to support them, but not enough to live in luxury.

I have a much higher-paying job. Since it's just me and Sadie,  I make sure she has the best possible life. She goes to a private school, set her up a college fund, and she has much better things than most kids (phone, clothes, etc). I still managed to raise her to be humble and not take things for granted, and she's one of the hardest working people I know, always making sure to get good grades and keep her room tidy. 

Well, the last few times she came back after a weekend at John's, I noticed that the clothes she was bringing back in her duffel are a) not her size and b) much cheaper and poorer quality than what I usually buy for her. I asked her why that is and she told me that while she's at her dad's, Amanda takes away her nice clothes and gives them to her kids while Sadie gets the clothes they buy from Target. I asked her if she wanted them back but she said she didn't mind sharing since all her favourite clothes were kept here.

The problem came when I went to pick her up last weekend.I had a business meeting and couldn't drive her over, so Amanda offered to just pick Sadie up from school, which hadn't happened before. When I got there on Sunday, John and Amanda asked me to sit down with them and when Sadie came to hug me, Amanda sent her to her room quite harshly saying her punishment wasn't over yet. I was confused because Sadie very rarely misbehaves.

They sat me down in the kitchen and said that it was unfair for Sadie to be going to a private school while her kids go to a public one, so they'd decided that Sadie would be pulled out of private school and put in the same school as the girls. They also said I should keep up Sadie's punishment because when they told her she blew up at them, told them it wasn't fair, and yelled that Amanda and her kids weren't even her real family, that all they did was steal.

I told them in no uncertain terms to fuck off. I would not be pulling my child out of a school she likes, away from her friends, because they can't afford it. I told them they could easily make as much money as me if Amanda started working in her field because she has the qualifications and the job market is very good. I told them their money problems are not my issue, and if Sadie's items get stolen again or they try to pull her out of school, I'll be taking this to court.

They've been blowing up my phone ever since, calling me a selfish AH, and after telling the story to a friend, he told me I was rubbing my success in their face, but I still don't feel like I did anything wrong. Still, AITA?

EDIT: I got temporary guardianship while waiting for a court hearing. We're going to try to get full custody and have John get one day a week of visitation, supervised for at least the first few months, and no contact with Amanda or her kids.This way, he still sees Sadie just as much and they can try to repair their relationship, but she doesn't have to go back there. All contact between us is made through emails which are CC'ed by my lawyer, and I've asked for Sadie's things back. I've talked to Sadie and we've decided that she's going to try therapy for a little while to help deal with everything that's happened.

UPDATE: We've had the hearing and our custody arrangement's been modified. Any and all decisions relating to Sadie are made by me, and me alone. John has supervised visitation once a week, and Sadie will continue in therapy to deal with all the issues Amanda and co. have caused her. 

They tried to push for 50/50 custody split on grounds of alienation (so me trying to put Sadie against her father), but we made it clear from the start that we wanted to keep Amanda and her children away, and wanted supervision only because we don't feel safe leaving him alone as of yet, but that we were open to modifications. Thanks to that, the proof of stealing, and Sadie's therapist's testimony, their claim was thrown out pretty quickly. 

Amanda's pissed, and has tried to contact me and Sadie, but I made it clear to her that if she keeps harrassing me or my daughter, I'll have to make this known to the authorities. Sadie and I have blocked her everywhere, and any communication between John and us is made through text messages or emails only. 

I'd like to thank you all for your support throughout all of this, it really means a lot to us.

AITA? For cutting my niece off college fund because of what she said about me.,"
I'm just going to be direct and quick. 

I (M35) have 2 sisters that I'm close with, I also have a niece (Leah), Leah's 16 and after my ex wife decided to split up and divorce due to inferitility problems that lasted for 5 years. I started a college fund for Leah to help her go to her chosen college. That was in 2019 

Now I visit my mother's home (where my sister and Leah are living) every week to spend the weekend together. 

This past weekend I was asleep upstairs while my mother, my sister and Leah were in the kitchen. I came downstairs to grab a glass of water and heard my sister talking about my ex wife expecting a baby with her new husband. This struck a nerve and I kind of froze from shock. I then heard Leah react to the news repeatedly saying ""I told you so I told you so"" then explained she's always thought that I was the one with a problem for not being able to have a baby with my ex, but that I was too ""afraid"" to admit due to fragile masculinity. I could not believe what she said but what made it worse is her following statement about how my ex was smart to get a divorce before it was too late. I went upstairs and into the room and shut the door and stayed there for hours. 

Mom and sister saw me about to leave and insisted to know what the problem was. I didn't want to argue but I told them that I heard what Leah said about me. Leah stopped eating and got quiet. My sister tried to play dumb but I told her I heard their entire conversation about my ex wife and her pregnancy news. My sister tried to backpaddle saying Leah is just a kid who doesn't know much about this stuff and was just ""spouting nonesense"". I told them I don't wanna talk about it and they refused to let me leave but I left eventually.


I later sent my sister a text telling her about how hurt and devastated I was because of what Leah said, and told her I will no longer be responsible for funding her education. My sister kept trying to call then texted saying Leah didn't mean what she said and offered to make her apologize but I didn't feel comfortable being in the same room with someone who, blamed me for something that was out of my control and, something that literally turned my life upside down. 

My mother tried to get me to come over so we could talk saying Leah doesn't deseve me turning my back on her like that.


ETA So this went off unexpectedly, I read a lot of insightful comments but couldn't keep up (I'm sorry). I haven't seen my sister nor Leah after what happened. but they are still trying to contact me, which means there's still a room for a discussion and so I've decided to go see them tomorrow, sit down together and have a long conversation but this. Now I admit I'm not the type of person that feels comfortable talking about what's bothering me. especially when it comes to sensitive topics, but like some of you have said, this is my family, my niece and her future. I admit that I was mad when I told my sister about the college fund cancelation, I love Leah so much and see her as my own daughter. Unfortunately her dad, my BIL is deceased and so I understand losing a parent at a young age and relate to the kind of hurt she carries inside ( lost my father in an accident when I was 11) And I think that...sitting down and talking things out is the best option before I make any decision. Hopefully this will get resolved soon and I'm so sorry for the long ETA but I just wanted to let you guys know. I might update on what happens after we talk so we'll see how it goes.


Thank you so much for bearing with me. Also, one more thing to clarify, both my ex wife and I were having these fertility issues, both sides but since my ex wife got pregnant soon after her new marriage then my family thought that I was the problem ""originally"". It is what it is and I'm learning to not words get in my head so easily. I'm not mad at anyone, I'm just trying to move on with my life like anybody else.",24698,uq4hu3,"NTA, they let her sit there and have an adult conversation, but want to call her a child when they are consequences of that conversation. You're not responsible for paying for her education. And you're only 35, it's possible that you can find someone else and have your own child. So save that money for your own potential future child. 

And your sister has a lot of nerve, if the girl doesn't want to take it upon herself to apologize, a forced apology from her is not going to mean a damn thing.

I'm childless and my brother has two daughters, and I like to send them stuff and contribute to their college funds, but it's only because I choose to, I am not obligated to. They have two parents with jobs who can help contribute to their education and other extracurriculars. Being the childless Aunt/Uncle does not mean we are a bank.",7498,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uq4hu3/aita_for_cutting_my_niece_off_college_fund/,"['im', 'going', 'direct', 'quick',

AITA for refusing to give this woman her grandma's wedding dress and jewelry back?,"I(26F) bought a hoarder house back in May 2018. It is a big 6 bedroom 4 and a half bathroom house.

When I bought it, the contract stated that I take ownership of the house and everything in it. The lady who owned it died, and her heirs could not deal with the stench and literal mountain of junk and waste in it (you could only open the door not even 8"", and some rooms had the junk filling them wall to wall and floor to ceiling).

Well it took me these last 4 years to finish cleaning, fixing and updating it. While doing the cleaning I made sure to check everything before throwing it out. Ended with more than $20k of money, some nice jewelry and antique furniture, and finally a stunning 40s style, lace covered wedding dress. This woman took care of that dress untill she couldn't anymore, and it took just some minor work to restore it.

I currently don't have a partner, but I decided that it would he the dress I will be wearing if I ever get married.

While doing the cleaning, I reached to the heirs to pass on some pictures and momentos (Christmas personalized ornaments, some kid artwork...), and because of that, I had one of them (30s F) in my FB friends list.

After repairing the dress, I put it on with the jewelry and posted a pic on FB. Well this woman saw it and asked for the dress and heirlooms back.

I refused to give them back, and legally they can't do anything. Also if they meant that much to them, they should have cleaned the house on their own, not sell it to me.

Now she, and all her family, are calling me out on social media. AITA?",24647,wzfy5w,"I am going to come at this from a different perspective. My father and his wife were hoarders. It was so bad that they had 2 homes condemned by the county and then, after as much as could be determined to have value was rescued and the houses razed to the ground, they proceeded to fill an apartment to the the point that all you could do is open the door about 18 inches. The rest of the apartment was so full of crap that my 5 foot 2 inch sister had to stoop to walk into the apartment.  You couldn't even get to the bathroom. They were using grocery bags and soda bottles as toilets. We know because they hoarded these too. 

How do I know all of this? Because *we* cleaned it out when my father died. (His wife died about six months before my father.) 

If we had dumped all of this on someone else I would never have expected to get anything back.

AITA for showing my missing eye to the new teacher after he told me my bangs are disrespectful?,"I had an accident when I was a baby and I lost my left eye. I don't have an eye socket I could put a fake eye in, it's just normal skin and some scars on a big pach of my face (they reconstructed my face with a later surgery this way). The right side and the bottom half of my face is completely normal. 

I have big side bangs that hide the left side of my face so I don't freak anyone out and I don't get weird looks. I've been going to the same school since I was 5, so the teachers and the kids know about it. 

We got a new teacher this week. He started by asking us to go around and introduce ourself. When it got to me, he was rude and asked me ""do your parents know you come to school looking like this? It's extremely disrespectful, fix your bangs, I want to see your face!"" 

So I obeyed and tucked my bangs behind my ear, showing the left side of my face. He gasped, his face turned red, my classmates laughed and he told me that I can let my bangs down. 

Later that day, my head teacher came to me to scold me. She told me I was wrong to ""shock"" the new teacher and I should've just told him about it. 

Did I do anything wrong? I just obeyed his orders, it's not my fault he ended up not wanting to look at my face. AITA?

-----
Update:

My mom went in to talk to the head teacher. It turned out that the new teacher made it sound like I was playing a prank on him, trying to deliberately shock him and make fun of him in front of the class. 3 of my classmates had to be called in to confirm my part of the story. 

The head teacher apologized, called it an unfortunate misunderstanding and told us she will clear it up with the new teacher, I don't have to worry about it. I don't believe it was just a ""misunderstanding"", it sounds like the new teacher deliberately lied, but we can't do anything about it...",24480,vcp73o,"NTA 1000X, you followed his orders.

AITA for telling a family to fly private?,"I was recently flying from NYC to LAX for a work trip and I had the displeasure of sitting next to a family and a little boy (9). I got on the plane in the midst of issues with my diabetes and I needed to eat within two hours so I began snacking. I immediately began receiving dirty looks from the parents and the mother said “can you not do that? Our son.” so I put my food away and figured I’d wait until the flight attendant came around so I could buy food from her and eat at an acceptable time just to show some respect for their wishes.  

So the flight attendant comes by with her beverages and snacks, I start to ask for a Coke and a snack box, but before I can finish the sentence the father says “nothing for this row, we’re all set here” and she continues on. I go up to press the call light so I can get my food and my drink because I actually need it and the father says “our son has prader-willi, we’d prefer it if you didn’t eat because it causes tantrums when he doesn’t know he can’t eat and he’s always hungry”. I’m close to a tantrum myself at this point and so I look him in the eye and say “I do not care, fly private if you want to control your surroundings”. 

The flight attendant comes back and I get my food and my drink, I snarf it down and chug my soda, and I sit back. As soon as I’m calmed and I’m able to open my laptop and get back to work the mother leans in and says “I feel a calling to educate you about my son’s disease” and I felt my entire body clench up. She keeps talking to me and explaining how I’d made her son feel and I said “listen lady, I don’t fucking care, I’m going to handle my T1D the way I see fit and you’re going to handle your son the way you see fit. I’m not endangering myself because you don’t want to deal with a tantrum, if you want to control other people then you book all the seats in a row or you fucking fly private.”

I recounted the story to a friend of mine once I’d gotten off the plane and she immediately told me that I was a huge AH and I should’ve given them a little bit of grace due to their son’s condition. I kind of feel bad but at the same time, I think that it’s unavoidable if you’re going into public and you’re around others.

AITA for refusing to to let my husband's infertile friend name our son?,"

My husband (m33)s best friend (m37) Will is infertile. He got divorced 2 times because of it and because he lied and hid his infertility. And his life hasn't been the same the day he was told he can't have kids. He has always had a soft spot for children and when he found out that my husband and I are expecting, he was so thrilled and started buying us gifts and decore pieces that he made from his woodwork for the baby. My husband thinks that those are all nice gestures but I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable especially with how much he keeps mentioing the baby.


A few days ago, my husband and I found the gender of the baby. The minute we told Will, he started calling the baby a random name he picked and was going to give to his baby if he wasn't infertile. He then started begging us to use this name and my husband said it was a ""done deal"". I refused but my husband called me heartless and asked me to do this one small, nice gesture for his struggling friend to give him closure and honor him after all the things he has done for us. I flipped and said it's my baby not his. Will heard this and left immediately. My husband yelled at me saying it's his baby too and my behavior towards Will was abhorant. He left after him and didn't come back til the morning. He kept saying the same thing and pressuring me to agree on the name but I refused.

AITA for dropping him and his daughter off at a rental car place states away from home?,"Long story short: I (27f) started seeing 44yo ""Dave"" 3 years ago. I have 2 sons, 9 and 6. He has 1 daughter ""Ann"", 17. I booked a road trip for me and my sons roughly 3 months ago. A road trip consisting of roughly 26 hours worth of driving with stops in between. This is the first time I've ever been financially able to do much of anything with my children so I went all out. Planned to stop at every place they had ever asked me to go, basically. I was beyond excited to surprise them with this trip. We got home 4 nights ago.

A week before leaving my Dave decides he wants to go with me and bring Ann as a ""bonding"" experience. We do not live together and Ann has never liked me because I'm ""boring"". She has said this to my face. So Dave thinks it will be good. I didnt really want either of them to go but thought what the hell, why not. This could be good for us. Boy was I fucking wrong. From the moment Ann got in to my vehicle she started complaining about absolutely everything. It was too crowded, too loud, we were taking too many stops, the boys were ""too annoying"" and ""need to quiet the fuck down and chill out"". 

We get a hotel 9 hours in (PA). Its around 3pm at this point. Dave asks if he can take a drive with Ann because she was getting irritated with the kids. I told him he could if he makes it quick because I needed to go get dinner supplies. 3 hours later he shows back up. Him and Ann went out to eat. So I make a comment saying ""you didnt think we wanted to eat too?"" And Ann snaps back with ""I dont think we asked."" 

After comments like this for days I finally snapped. My body are now saying they just want to go home because several times Dave told my kids to be quiet because of his kids comfortability. At this point I havent done anything with my kids because the queen would have a fit if we pulled off anywhere AND Dave at this point basically refused to let me drive despite me arguing. IN MY CAR. So I snapped, told him to pull the fuck over. When he finally does, I drive to the nearest car rental and tell them to get the fuck out of my car. Dave and Ann both start flipping out. Ann saying she isnt going to get in a car that has ""bed bugs"". Dave saying he didnt want to take separate vehicles and didnt have enough money for a rental because the queen spent over $1500 in 4 days. So I say ""I dont believe I fucking asked."" And take off. They were close to 800 miles from home. It took them 4 days to get home due to lack of money and needing to borrow. I'm being told I'm a selfish cunt. AITA?",24396,tg1fhu,"NTA.

AITA for leaving the restaurant before my boyfriend's family arrived after I was told that I was going to pay for their meals?,"

I (f29) have been dating my boyfriend (m35) 'Ricky' for 5 months. He's divorced but hates this word and goes with the word ""divorcee"" instead since the first one makes it sound like he was ""dumped"" when it was him who initiated it.


Anyways, He always go on long rants about his exes and say stuff like ""I hope you don't have this awful habit my ex has"" or ""hope you like XYZ cause my ex didn't"" and the list goes on.


I found a 2nd job recently and he's been having me pay every time we go out. When I protest he'd say he's going through a rough patch and is seeing how much help I cam offer.


Last night he invited his family to join us for dinner. We got to the restaurant first. He asked me if I ""brought"" enough momey, I said why and he told me that he told his parents that I'd pay for their meals. I said why would I and he went on about his parents going through a rough patch just like him. I said ""I'm sorry this can't be a coincidence!"" he asked what I meant and I told him that I would not be paying. He insisted, I refused and said no. He then leaned back and said ""well, you're here, so not much of a choice you have anyway"" while laughing like it was funny. I silently got up, took my phone and purse and walked right out. He was shocked he started shouting after me to stop and wait but I didn't.


I went home and he called me enraged saying that I did a horrible thing walking out on him and his parents, while I could've just paid. I told him that their unfortunate financial situation isn't my problem and that I wasn't obligated to pay for their food. If they couldn't pay for their meals, then they should not go out. He got offended and said and I qoute ""you're making money a priority just like my ex did"" then went on about how disrespectful my attitude was and how I made him look small infront of his parents and forced him to lie about why I wasn't there when they came.

We've been going back an forth about it til now. He's mad and is refusing to speak to me til I apologize. AITA? I feel bad because his parents are lovely and I been doing my best to keep a good relationship with them.",24357,xf3my2,"NTA. There’s a reason why he’s divorced. So many red flags in this post. 

1st : refusing to say divorce bc it looks like he was dumped 

2nd : treating you like a personal ATM 

3rd : wanting to make you his parents’ ATM

AITA for leaving after being told to be quiet at dinner?,"The title probably makes it sound worse than it was, but I’m still conflicted.

My (f21) boyfriend (m24) of almost a year, invited me to dinner with his family. (Mom, dad and his 16yr old brother.) Never met them prior to that. The only thing I knew about them is that they’re conservative and christians but lovely people. 

And they were. I got along really well with them, before dinner. They were lovely and talkative. When it was time for dinner, my bfs dad wanted to pray. After praying he said, something alone the lines of “let us dig and let the food keep us quiet.” This is a pretty popular saying in our country, mostly told to young children in school. My understanding of this has always been that you shouldn’t speak with food in your mouth or be extremely loud at the table. I wouldn't say its a cultural thing, though.

I dug in, took a bite. It was fish soup. Absolutely delicious. And y’know, like a good guest I wanted to compliment the cook. “This is delicious - is it saffron? A perfect autumn soup!” My bfs brother looked surprised. My bfs father hushed me. Big time. A really aggressive SHHH with a finger over his lips. And then he said, again, “Let the food keep us quiet.” I aplogised because I thought I had accidentally spoken with food in my mouth or something. But a few minutes passed and nobody said a word. Super awkward and weird, especially since they had been so talkative before. My bf was also unusually quiet. 

After a few minutes I was too weirded out and asked about their day, and how nice it was that they invited me there. And his mother did the hush thing? So awkward. I think this is when it clicked, no speaking at all at the table. Let the food keep us quiet. Really quiet. But this was a super awkward situation, and I couldn’t deal with that. Imagine sitting at a table with 5 people, everybody eating soup looking dead serious. So I laughed, it just slipped out. Ended up being told off by bfs parents that I was being disrespectful etc. and if I didn’t respect how their household worked I could eat alone in the kitchen. (We were eating in like a separate dining room.) Sooo I thanked them for the food and left to the hotel me and bf stayed at.

My boyfriend later told me that was an asshole move, that I should’ve just kept quiet or eat alone in the kitchen. I understand their family traditions and rules, but it was so weird.

AITA for leaving my best friend and his friends stranded in an unfamiliar city?,"So for background, my best friend has gotten into going to these Spartan races. He and a small group of his friends have started going to local ones but recently heard about one in another state they wanted to go to and compete in, but they didn't have anywhere to stay. So they asked me if they could borrow my truck and trailer (I have a tow behind camper) for the weekend. I said no, I wasn't comfortable with them taking my truck and trailer but that I'd drive them and the camper to their event. We made the three hour trip and set everything up in the area where the race was taking place the next day. 

I have a habit of leaving my keys on a hook next to the door to my bedroom in my camper. Remember this. 
Come nightfall, I went to take a phone call outside and ended up wandering around the grounds for over an hour. When I got back to the camper, the door was locked, and I was told by my best friend's older friend through the window that there wasn't enough room for me in MY trailer. So I reached for my keys to unlock the door, but realized I had left them inside the camper on the hook in my room. So I called my best friend from outside and all I was told was ""sorry bro, nothing I can do"". So I ended up sleeping in my truck that night, which I had fortunately left unlocked by accident.

Their race began at 8 am, and at 7, they came meandering out of the trailer and woke me up. No apology, by the way. 

So while they were in their race, I hooked my truck back up to the trailer, closed and locked everything, and waited until just after they finished and had started walking back to the trailer (think really wide open field). When I saw them coming, I started the truck and drove off the property. With them chasing behind. I made the three hour trip back home declining call after call. When I finally got home, I finally took my best friend's call. He started yelling at me saying ""why would you do this? We have no way home now"". I just said sorry, you shouldn't have made me sleep in my truck after I did you this solid. 

He told me that there were better ways to handle this than by leaving them in an unfamiliar city with no way home. I think he ended up calling his dad to come and get them.

"AITA for ""making"" my boyfriend eat fast food for a week?","My boyfriend grew up in a house that valued outdated gender norms. The women were always responsible for cooking and cleaning, so he didn't learn how to do any of that for most of his life. That is, until he moved in with me after college. 

He's been good about a few things. He doesn't mind helping with dishes or handling the laundry, but the one thing I can't seem to get him to do is learn how to cook. The only thing he can do is microwave frozen meals. I've been trying to teach him the basics, but it seems like it goes through one ear and just comes out the other. He still can't turn on the oven or use the stove without help. The toaster is too complicated for him to use he claims.  Doesn't know how to boil eggs, cook rice, or even how to measure out ingredients using cups. I just don't understand why he can't grasp this but is fine with other things. 

Here's the part where I may be an asshole. I went on a trip two weeks ago for work. I'm in charge of buying groceries (we have separate accounts) and I realized how expensive his frozen meals actually are. Three to four dollars for each. I said screw it and bought the easiest ingredients I could find for a lot cheaper for him to cook on his own. He doesn't like leftovers, so me cooking ahead for him was out. Before I left, I sat him down once again and gave him a very long lesson on using the oven, toaster, and stove, as well as how to boil/scramble eggs, toast a piece of toast, boil rice/noodles, and heat up pasta sauce. I also taught him how to pan fry things like onions and other veggies, and how to tell when they were ready. In case he didn't want to cook both lunch and dinner, I also bought things to make salads and fixings for sandwiches. 

I come back a week later, and he is angry! He claims I practically left him to starve, and how I know he has trouble cooking. I retaliate, saying I showed him what to do, and I get a whole range of excuses. ""Setting the oven/stove temp is too complicated"" ""He cut his finger chopping onions and couldn't chop any until his cut healed"" ""He only likes the salad kits so everything is balanced"" 

Apparently he only ate sandwiches, canned goods, and fast food for a week. He thinks I'm a major asshole for not telling him I'm not buying his frozen meals, and leaving him alone to fend for himself. On one hand, I do think it was shitty of me not to tell him I didn't buy his meals, and as someone who grew up in a home pretty much only boiled hotdogs and veggies, and only properly learned how to cook after moving, out I do feel for him, but at the same time, after a few months of not getting the simplest concepts, I'm left feeling partially justified in my actions. So Reddit, AITA?",24288,wk815y,"info: how can he work the microwave but can't put bread in a toaster ??

this goes beyond outdated gender norms, OP. NTA. you could've told him you didn't get his TV dinners but you sure as hell didn't leave him to fend for himself.

AITA for responding to my father’s request for a relationship with a detailed PowerPoint on why he will never be forgiven?,"If I’m the AH here, I’ll own it.  I’m not sorry, but like it would be good to know because the rest of my family thinks this went too far.

My (24F) mom died when I was 7 from leukemia. I have very few memories of her from before she was sick and I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with her in her last year but she was an artist and until she couldn’t anymore she would make me little collages when she was in the hospital with drawings and photos and messages for me. My grandmother put them all in a book for me after she died.  I wanted to be like my mom and my counselor thought it would help, so I started a journal where I would do kind of a similar thing and I’ve done at least one page a week all these years ever since my mom died, more when I miss her or have something hard going on. So, I have kind of a unique record of my mental state over the last 16 years.

My father remarried when I was 9.  My step-mother really leaned hard into the “I’m your mom now” and my father didn’t stop her.  It improved when they had my half-brother because she basically forgot about me then. Unfortunately he got cancer when he was 3. And I pretty much ceased to exist for my father, he was either working or gone with my brother and I spent all my teen years mostly at home alone or with my grandparents. The mantra was that my brother needed to be the focus because he might die so I needed to not be selfish since I was healthy. I stopped trying to talk to him when I was 16 and it was a dark time.  I moved out when I was 18 and cut them off completely.

My grandparents let me know that my brother died a couple of years ago but respected my desire to remain NC with my father. He recently reached out to them because he wants to see me and talk.  I went through my old journals and made him a PowerPoint with images of the entries where I had talked about being frustrated and feeling abandoned and unwanted, some with literal quotes of things my dad had said to me during arguments. Even the really dark stuff from when I was seriously depressed. Then I ended it with a photo of one of my mom’s collages where she had written “Remember that your dad and I are always here for you” and I wrote “You failed. Go away.” underneath. I felt like him being able to see it from my literal perspective would communicate why I don’t want him back better than I could.

Evidently it worked, but a little too well because I’ve been bombarded by family telling me that it’s understandable that I don’t want to see him, but what I sent gutted him and he’s completely fallen apart after reading through it and it was unnecessarily cruel.

Maybe it was, I know my bar for that is kind of weird sometimes, so AITA?

Edit - A couple of follow up notes, since it came up the comments:

1.  I loved my brother.  I don’t resent him.  He was a good kid and I wish he was still with us.  None of this is his fault, to me it is completely my father’s and to a lesser extent step-mother’s. The parents prevented me from spending time with him as he got sicker so I wouldn’t have been allowed to be there for him even if I had been able to (which I wasn’t towards the end because I was also struggling to stay alive).

2.  I have empathy.  I understand what my father lost, I was there.  I also lost those same people plus effectively my father.  Even so, to me there is no excuse for completely shutting your own kid completely out of your life while also preventing them from getting any kind of help.  I understand depression and freezing up, I’ve been there, and I still even not being an adult managed to consider the impact of my behavior on other people.  If he was that bad off, he should have given me up to be raised by someone else.  My mom’s parents asked and he wouldn’t agree to let me stay with them full time.  I could have had a dad that was able to occasionally tell me he loved me even if it was just a text message.  Alternatively, I could have lived with my grandparents and had people around me who cared about me every day even if that wasn’t my father.  I got neither and every request for help of any kind was met with “suck it up”.  I can empathize with having to function while breaking down inside, but I can’t empathize with what he did.

3.  I gather from relatives (who have backed off after some hard boundary setting) that my father and step-mother split not long ago and are in divorce proceedings, which is why he reached out now and why the rest of the family was upset with how I responded at the time - he wasn’t in a good place already.  I’ve told them that if they care about him to encourage him to keep away from me, refuse to pass on any messages, and try to get him into inpatient care or something if they’re that worried he’s going to do something rash.  I don’t want anything to do with him and I’ve told them that I don’t want to hear about anything that happens after this point, but the rest of his family love him so for their sake I hope he pulls himself together.",24212,zh2g3s,"NTA he failed.

AITA? For not wearing a wedding ring and making my coworker think I'm single?,"
I F30 started working at a company recently. I get along with most of my coworkers but been having some issues with this guy ""Morgan"". Morgan from what I understand is what everyone call ""the handsome"" guy in the office. He dated 2 of his coworkers and hit on several others. He seemed friendly when we talked, he seemed respectable and never asked questions outside of work.


He offered to buy me lunch and internet and kept sending me funny memes and stuff. It was nice but felt a bit too much so I asked that he stop and he did.


He started sending me pics of him that were inappropriate. I texted him saying that I'm married and he was being inappropriate. He texted saying I was lying about being married to get him off my back, then went on about how nice and attractive he is, and how I'm trying to act like I don't like him to get him to try harder. I felt frustrated especislly after he kept sendig me pics. Days ago he sent me a d&ck pic and told me to ""suck it"". I decided to let my husband deal with it. He sent him a text back saying ""sorry bud, small objects are a chocking hazard for her"". Then blocked him.

The other day he came into the office looking furious and ""confronted"" me about being misleading by not having a wedding ring on when I'm married. I said I didn't need to prove anything to anybody and didn't lead anyone on. He said he was trying to get close to me and I should've told him I'm married from the get go. I said I was sorry but he maybe he shouldn't have basically tried to enforce a relationship with anyone regradless if they're in a relationship or not. He said that my husband and I were rude and offensive then rushed out. Other coworkers said Morgan was an asshole but I too bare the blame for having my wedding ring on and being somewhat misleading. I said I don't think I owe anyone an explanation and refused to apologize for what happened just to keep the peace in the office.

AITA for calling out step-family’s dirty laundry at Thanksgiving after they criticized me for being unmarried?,"I’m still getting shit for this from my family so it’s possible I may be a bit of the AH here.

I’m 29F, the players are my mom, step-dad, and four step-siblings (35M, 37M, 40F, 42M) and their families.  I’m the black sheep in that I’m the only one not married with kids, but that’s by my preference.  I love living alone, I don’t want kids, and having a partner just isn’t that important to me.  My family has been asking me when I’m going to get a boyfriend and settle down since I was 19 and the answer has always been “ew, never”.

I was going to skip Thanksgiving, but my mom insisted that she wanted everyone home this year if possible so I went. It was the usual drill, but youngest step-brother and his wife are having another kid so that was the big announcement.  This was fine until around the end of dinner one of the SSILs asks if I’m not anxious to have kids since I’m almost 30 and time is running out.  I laughed and said “Nah, I’m good.”  That led to one of the step-brothers saying that every family needs an old maiden aunt and some other comments I didn’t appreciate. I said let’s move on, but my mom said “We’re just worried about you.”

AITA for eating at the same restaurant as my husband’s family?,"I (32F) have been married to my husband (35M) for 3 years. We dated for 2 years before that. I want to start this off by saying that he really is a good guy in other areas. 

My husband’s parents, his 2 brothers (ages 38 and 40ish), and his brothers’ girlfriends/fiancées have a tradition of going out to dinner once a month. I am invited about 50% of the time. I’ve talked to my husband’s brother’s fiancée, and she says she is invited every time. 

When I say I’m not invited, I mean that my husband tells me “I’m going to the family dinner. It’s probably best if you sit this one out.” When I expressed that I wanted to come, he told me that it would be for the best if I didn’t. It has caused several fights.

About a week ago, my husband went to a family dinner that I wasn’t invited to. I was very pissed. So earlier that day, I called and made a reservation at the restaurant they were going to. My husband left the house, not knowing about my reservations, and I left 15 minutes after him. 

I ended up seated at a table where I couldn’t see his family. So I got up as if I was going to the bathroom and walked right past them. They were all there, including his brothers’ SOs. My husband looked completely shocked and asked me what I was doing there. I told him that I had just been dying for a steak, so I came and got one at the restaurant. 

My mother in law said it was very rude of me to interrupt their family dinner. I pointed out that I wasn’t trying to join them, I was just going to the bathroom. I told them to have a good meal and I left. I went and finished my steak by myself.

My husband was really pissed when he came home, and he told me that he couldn’t believe how much of an asshole I had been. I said that he was an asshole for not inviting me to his dinners when his brothers’ SOs got to go. My husband said that the decision to invite was between him and his family, and I should respect it. 

Anyway, with the way the word asshole was thrown around, it made me think of this sub. So I wanted to ask if I am the asshole. Am I?

AITA for getting mad at my husband because he laughed when I told him to reheat his own dinner?,"

For context_ I'm a sahm with 2 kids (3yrs old & 6months old) My husband is an ambulance driver, he works odd hours and comes home unexpectedly, he expects dinner or lunch ready whenever he gets home, whether I'm sleeping or busy with the kids. It's exhausting but do it because I know how hard he works.

After struggling with this for long, my mom suggested that I start pre-making meals so that dinner or lunch can be ready when he's home, all he's gotta do is just reheat it. I immediately got to it and went grocery shopping and spent an entire 2 days making meals and storing them in the fridge. His response to this idea is ""whatever"". I was sort of relieved cause now I could sleep properly, the kids care won't get interrupted etc.


Well, at 11pm last night, he comes home while I'm sleeping after putting the baby to sleep. I wake up to him shouting for me from the livingroom. I rush out and ask what was happening and he tells me he's hungry and wants dinner. I tell him it's in the fridge and just needs to be reheated and he didn't have to wake me up for it. He tells me I need to go reheat it for him. I say no, not happening and he needs to reheat his own dinner. He starts laughing sarcastically which got me mad. He then tells me I'm ridiculous to assume that after working no stop for an entire shift that he should be ""expected"" to do a chore aka reheat dinner himself, when I'm here and I can do it. I start arguing with him after he complains I'm not doing enough and refuse to reheat it then I go back inside the bedroom and shut the door.

He comes an hour later yelling about how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger just cause I'm petty trying to prove a point, I tell him he's being unreasonable to expect me to reheat his dinner when he could do it himself. He gives me a nasty look then tells me he's going to bed hungry and I'm responsible for this then heads out. This morning he silently gets dressed and leaves while turning his phone off.",24053,tikg9a,"NTA and I’m so upset and angry on your behalf. 6 months means no sleep and broken nights, still being milk on tap, no clothes fitting still, and wild hormones. A 3 year old means getting no rest during the day even when the baby sleeps because 3 year olds +do not stop+. Both together means no privacy, no space, constant touch, constant shouting, and complete exhaustion. You’re doing amazingly to do what you have.

He is unreasonable. Utterly. This is not fair, healthy or good behaviour. It is utterly dismissive of what you’re doing, shows no care or consideration towards you and is completely selfish.

Depending on your relationship you could try and talk to him about how tired you are, what you do because he might not realise. If you’re more of a “show don’t tell” and can trust him to pull his finger out, go away for a weekend without the kids when he’s off so he can feel what it’s like and then have a talk. If neither of these are possible, then take the children and go and stay with your mother (or another family member) if possible. That’ll give you some space to work out what you want, and someone to help you so you’re not alone.

AITA for getting mad at my mum for making my girlfriend sleep on the floor?,"Throwaway.

My girlfriend, “Rose,” and I have been together for 4 years and she is 5 months pregnant with our first child. My mum seemed to really like Rose (or at the very least tolerated her) - but after we announced that we were expecting, something definitely switched in her. 

She has become extremely rude and disrespectful towards my girlfriend. She makes passive-aggressive comments at every chance she gets. I’ve had to take a step back from my mother until she fixes her behaviour.

Rose had gone to visit her family who lives far out of town. It was a very last-minute trip, and she drove herself to the destination and back. Unfortunately, at around 6pm, her car broke down and she was forced to pull over. Fortunately, my brother, “Chris,” who’s great with cars and lives about an hour and ½ from where Rose was stranded, was willing to pick her up and sorted everything out. I was out of the country, so I’m grateful that my brother sorted everything out for her.

Chris moved back in with my mum about a year ago. Obviously, the situation wasn’t the best, especially considering the tension between Rose and my mom that exists for no particular reason, but I hoped my mum could put her pettiness aside for at least a night.

It was too late for Chris to drive Rose back home, so my brother told her that he would drive her back tomorrow morning. An arrangement that my mum seems to not like, but one that she managed to keep her mouth shut about (my girlfriend tells me)

Rose helps prepare dinner, wash up, and actually engage in a decent conversation with my mum for the first time in ages. However, they mostly avoid each other. Chris goes to bed earlier, leaving my mum and Rose.

My mum lives in a two-bedroom apartment and since both bedrooms were taken. Rose assumed that she would be sleeping on the couch.

She apparently assumed wrong.

My mum gives Rose the thinnest blanket ever and basically screams at her, telling her that she has to sleep on the floor to not “ruin her couch.” She tells Rose to “make do,” with the pillows on the couch and the blanket that provides zero warmth. 

Rose thought about protesting, but ultimately decided against it. According to Rose, my mum kept opening her door to check if she was sleeping on the couch, so she couldn’t even try to sleep on the couch.

At 5am, Chris found Rose on the couch and let her sleep on his bed. He ended up telling me, but told me to not make a “big fuss out of it.”

I did the exact opposite.

I called my mum, very angry, and told her that she was disrespecting her so badly. She tried to defend herself by saying, “that she didn’t harm the baby,” and “it’s okay for pregnant women to sleep on the floor,” but I Refused to hear any of it. Chris agrees with me, but told me that I shouldn’t make it a fight. I feel like I’m losing my mind. AITA?",23984,ubkw4s,"Pregnant or not- who makes a guest sleep on floor to ""not ruin the couch""?

AITA for exposing my ex to his mother about our kids?,"I (45f) am currently divorced from my ex Thomas (47m) of 30years.  We ended up seeing a lawyer to help with dividing stuff. Everything was pretty much wrapped up till he said he no longer wanted any part of our kids' lives (5m) and (12f). I didn't argue with him about it since I already know what it's like having a parent who doesn't want you around or wants to be in your life. I asked what he wanted me to tell the kids and he just said ""whatever you think is best I don't care. I don't want to parent anymore."" Everything was in agreement and signed with no fuss.

A few weeks later I get a call from my ex Mil asking if we could meet each other. When I came over she broke down crying and begging to let my ex see his kids again. I was confused about what she meant because not once did he contact me after meeting the lawyer. She went on about how my ex said ""he really missed them and that I was just a petty b*tch for taking full custody."" Also that he was crying for days about it. I told her my version of events and she called it bs saying her son wouldn't lie like that especially not about his kids. Then I decided to call him in front of her. He didn't know she and I were meeting that day.

I said ""hey (5m) has a soccer game in a few days (which he did) and I was wondering if you wanted to go? I know he'd really love it and be happy to see you."" He instantly said ""No. I already said I'm not doing this anymore."" I raised my voice a bit saying ""well what about holidays and birthdays because we never discussed any of it and your family might want to see them."" He just said "" my family already thinks the kids aren't mine anyways so it doesn't matter."" I asked""well how do you think this is going to effect Denise (his mom)? She is over the moon about them."" He just said "" She loves me more than the kids so I doubt this will be an issue for her."" After a bit more talking we finally hung up. Ex Mil was straight faced and nodded at everything that just happened saying ""mmm okay."" She asked me to leave and said we would be in touch.

Later that day I got a call from my ex saying how it's my fault he was kicked out of his mom's house and possibly will be taken off her will. Also that none of his family members will talk to him because of what ex Mil heard. He threw a lot of insults at me before I hung up and now him and his mates keep calling and texting me. My friend is saying I shouldn't have said anything in the first place and I ruined his life.

Edition: hello thank you for your support and the gold reward. Yes, I plan to let Denise see the kids because I know she just wants to give them the world along with the rest of his family.

He made a decision for which he knew his family would judge him negatively, so he lied and made you the scapegoat. You didn’t go seeking out his family to tell them what he’d done, you were blindsided by the whole thing. No way were you obligated to carry that water for him. Not at all.

"AITA for insisting that my boyfriend pay me for breaking my $3,500 model ship?","
My F/33 Dad passed away and left me one of his last and favorite ship model, I had it on display in my living room. but for some reason I never actually mentioned it to my boyfriend M/37 of 6 months. Maybe because we don't live together and he don't visit often.


The other day he and his friends came over to my place to celebrate his birthday. They got drunk and started throwing the sofas pillows at each others. I told them to stop then went into the kitchen to clean up.

I then started hearing loud noise, I walked out the kitchen and saw my model ship in my boyfriend's hands. I rushed to get it but he passed it on to his friend, and then his friend passed it on to the other friend.

I started running around trying to catch it while yelling at them to stop then my boyfriend grabbed it again. I was so angry I told him to hand it over but he said I needed to kiss him first. I yelled at him and he tried to threw it to his friend who tried to catch it but it missee and hit the wall and broke.

I lost it!! kicked all of his friend out then had a fight with him telling him this was a sentimental item from dad and demanded that he pay me $3,500 because this is how much it costs. He left then called in the morning asking if I was serious about wanting him to pay $3,500 and I said I was dead serious. He started making excuses saying he was drunk and also, I never told him about this ship and how important it was for me before both monetarily and sentimentally so that's on me. we had another fight and then I hung up upon telling him I'm expecting the 3,500 and that I wasn't afraid to take the legal route if I have to. He kept texting asking me to let it go and saying it was cruel of me to threaten him with the law. he had his friends apologize thinking this would be it but I insisted that he pay me.

I get that I might've got worked up over an item and treated my boyfriend badly but to me it seemed like recklessness on his part. AITA?",23885,snl03t,"Nope NTA

AITA for wanting to tell my brother's fiancée about the tracking app he secretly installed in the new phone he bought for her?,"

Pretty much the title, My f22 brother m27 is currently engaged to his fiancèe f25. he bought he a new phone for valentine's and asked my boyfriend who's trained in computer and software to install a hidden tracking app on the phone so his fianceè won't see it or notice. I overheard them talking and when I entered the room they went silent. I waited til my brother left then talked to my boyfriend, he denied having this conversation with my brother first then, admitted to installing the app on the phone. I told him he and my brother were in the wrong because this is huge breach of privacy. he said he has nothing to do with it and advised me to stay out of it as well. but I said I want to tell my brother's fiancèe. my boyfriend argued with me about being nosy and intrusive and told me to stay out of it and let them deal with their own issues. But I thought that was unfair to my future sister in law since she's the one working, paying bills and rent and this is how she is treated? My boyfriend told me gtfo with this attitude and again, said I should stay of it because it does not in any way concern me. I don't know I feel horrible after hearing about what my brother did and since I have a good relationship with his fiancee I can't help but feel guilty and wanting to tell her.

AITA for sitting on my husband's lap during Thanksgiving dinner because all chairs at the table were taken?,"


I (f, 28) have been with my husband ""Shaun"" (m, 33) for 2 years, Married for 5 months. Most of his family are decent people but his mom can be a little of a passive-aggressive and tends to criticize me a lot. Shaun sees it as ""her still not getting used to me being around"" but IDK because she treats his ex ""Julissa"" good. MIL says that Julissa has been around the family for age and her past with Shaun never affected her relationship with her. Fine, I never minded her attending every holiday and being around til yesterday.


We had Thanksgiving dinner at my MIL's house. Shaun went there before me and when I arrived it was already dinner time. Everyone was seated and I saw that all chairs were taken. I asked MIL why she didn't save me a seat and she said ""sorry"" and that one of her granddaughters decided to show up last minute and the chair was taken. I looked at her then at Julissa who was sitting next to shaun and tried to point out how I was more deserving of her chair since I'm the DIL (I know shouldn't have said it I know..I know) MIL flatout said that Julissa is as much FAMILY as me, and that it was rude to imply otherwise. Julissa was nodding confidently while glancing at me. I was so upset I wanted to leave but decided to just sit on my husband's lap and act as casual as possible. I sat on his lap asking if he was okay with it (don't worry I'm petite, he's strong built) and started eating so casually while smiling and complimenting the food and mentioning to Shaun how warm and comfortable his lap was now and then. The table went awkwardly silence. BIL would try to break the silence and change the subject but it somehow goes back to being awkward. MIL AND Julissa were barely eating and were staring at each other than at me eyes wide open.


Minutes later, Julissa excused herself to the bathroom and so did MIL. It was still awkward but I did my best to focus on dinner. Shaun was eating as well. Later, there was just so much tension and MIL was barely able to speak after Julissa left (early, like right after dinner). Shaun and I went home and MIL tried calling but then called Shaun and texted me saying what I did was inappropriate and that I ruined Thanksgiving dinner and made it awkward. She said it wasn't her fault chairs were taken and I could've dragged a chair from the kitchen but acted childishly and made Julissa (and family) uncomfortable with how inappropriate I was.


EDIT: I need to mention that even if I took a chair from the kitchen. There was not enough space at dinner table to fit the chair. Everyone was sitting next to each other.",23840,z55m2b,INFO: Why did your husband not notice there was no chair for you until you showed up? Did he just forget you existed??

AITA for leaving my inlaws christmas dinner after I found out that they didn't make accommodations for me?,"



I got invited to my fiance's family christmas celebratory dinner. It's my first christmas with them. I have always been picky about what I eat. Can't help it and it has to do with psychological factors, childhood, and personal likes and dislikes. Before accepting their invite I let FMIL know that I wouldn't be eating the traditional food at their celebration, and showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate me. She refused and told me to bring my own dish. I said if I had to bring my own dish when I'm a guest then I better stay at home then. We went back and forth and I insisted I wouldn't come if accommodations weren't being made. I just thought it was a simple request and FMIL could've agreed if she really wanted me there. My fiance agreed that I shhould bring my own dish but I didn't.


When we arrived there and I saw that no accommodations were made I got up, go my things and walked out and went home. My FMIL and fiance were shocked. I got tons of calls and texts from them both and my fiance came home lashing out calling me selfish and spoiled to walk out like that over a dish that his mom didn't have to make for me. and, that it was my responsibilty to feed myself. How is it my responsibilty to feed myself when I'm a guest? Makes no sense to me. I told him this and he accused me of starting shit and ruining my first christmas with his family and disrespecting his mom.



Now he's continuelly saying I fucked up and should've sucked it up for the family's sake.


ETA to clear few points:


* For those saying I have no respect for my inlaws. I do, especially FMIL. I respect her but this is so far the biggest conflict we had.


* I work long hours even on holidays so not much time to cook.

AITA for evicting my sister and her daughters after the hid my wife's wig and embarrassed her?,"
First of, I want to start by mentioning that my wife is a cancer patient, She unfortunately started losing her hair due to chemo therapy and she's been incredibly insecure about it, her lack of hair in particular. She got a wig and started wearing it, I don't mind it, I 100% support her since she only wears it around family and friends.

My sister lost her apartment after a messy divorce and moved in with her twin daughters (16) almost a month ago. Things been going well except my nieces constant remarks about my wife's wig. They got so hung up on it and kept asking lots of questions about it. They asked to take turns to try it on, suggested they ""strighten"" it with the strightner and so on which was exhausting. They even pressured to see her without it but my wife was uncomfortable and refused.


Yesterday I got home and found that my wife was locking herself in the bedroom and crying. I asked what happened, She told me she woke up and didn't find her wig, then discovered my nieces took it and hid then urged her to come out so they could see her without it. My wife repeatedly asked them to give it back but they started laughing and recording , my wife got had to lock the door to keep a distance cause they didn't stop. I was fuming I went into the kitchen and confronted them, they acted confused but I was able to get the wig back. I lashed out telling them they humiliated my wife and barrassed her by taking away her wig. They said it was just lighthearted prank which made me go off on them. My sister got involved and said my wife was just being too sensitive and the girls were just curios to see her without a wig but she overreacted. I told her her daughters were recording her! She saw nothing wrong in it and said I overreacted as well. I lost it on her too and told her she and my nieces are no longer welcome to stay at my home and they needed to leave. I later let them know about the eviction since they thought I wasn't serious and they started crying begging that I let it go. But my wife is no longer comfortable around them after what they did.

AITA for scolding my struggling sister when she gives us grief about adopting a baby?,"My sister (35f) and her husband (37m) have been struggling with infertility since they got married 12 years ago. They've tried absolutely everything, from medical to spiritual, but unfortunately, nothing works. Now that she's approaching late 30s, they're starting to look into adoption, but it's also been a slow going, since their financial condition isn't exactly stable from multiple rounds of fertility treatments they went through. I can only imagine the struggle, and I sympathize with her, but the stress this situation is bringing her and her husband honestly puts a strain on our relationship.

My husband and I (both 30) lost our best friends, Mason and his wife, Kate, two weeks ago in a horrible car accident. They left behind their son Pete, who isn't even two yet. It was so sudden and so heart-wrenching. We're still grieving, which lowers out contact with a lot of people, including my sister and BIL. Our main concern right now is ourselves and Pete, whose custody has come to us because we're both his godparents, actively engaged in Pete's life since his birth, and because Mason and Kate have neither left a Will nor have immediate living relatives who can take him in.

We've decided to adopt Pete as soon as we can stomach the process. My husband and I never planned on having kids, and even if we did, this is absolutely not the way we want to go about it. The situation is far from ideal, but we're starting the adoption process yesterday, for Pete's safety if nothing else. We broke the news to our extended families and friends, letting them know that my husband and I won't be very available for a little longer because of this.

I know my sister and BIL will have something to say about this. I'm prepared for a few heated text messages or voice mails. However, I didn't expect them to turn up on our doorstep, crying about how ""unfair"" it is that we were given everything they wanted, and how we didn't deserve to be parents because we didn't go through what they had to. I've never seen my husband so angry before. He's usually very mild and gentle, but recent events have stretched our patience to the limits. We kicked them off of our porch, and I told my sister before she left that since our pain inconveniences her so much, I won't have her around me and my family at all anymore.

I know she made a fuss about it, and now everyone has something to say to us. We turned off our phones, so we don't know which ones are cursing us and which one aren't. I know some did/are. My husband and I are both in pain and grieving, and we can't trust ourselves to be objective. Did we go to far?

Edit: I originally did not want to put this information in, because I don't want everyone to point at it and say this is the reason we're not in the wrong. For the sake of disclosure: My husband and I are both men. No, this is not a case of homophobia. My sister, for all her fault, was the first person to accept me for who I love, and I will not hear a single word about this in the comment. ",23815,tnj5jr,"NTA

AITA for leaving the restaurant after my bf refused to pay for my meal?,"I had lent my bf some money few weeks ago because of something he needed and he promised to pay me back asap.

He was supposed to pay me back 5 days ago but something came up and he didn't. I tried to be patient.

Yesterday we had planned to go out with some friends at night for dinner. Yesterday after I came back from work I was robbed in the bus and I had all my money and cards stolen. I cancelled my cards but the bank customer service  told me my new card with my new details (both physical card and the digital details for apple pay) would be available the following morning because the banks were closed that afternoon. So I had no money.

When we went to dinner with my bf and friends I told my bf if he could just pay me back the money or at least pay for my meal since I have no money. He didn't exactly say yes or no, just a simple ""don't worry"". As we ordered he only ordered for himself and told me that he can't cover for mine at the moment so I better not order anything and just have some bites from his meal.

I was so mad and frustrated because he had promised to give me back the money, he then claimed something came up and couldn't give them back but then ordered a nice meal for himself and just told me to get his scraps because he wouldn't pay me back or at least for my meal. I'd be the only one sitting there with no meal in front of me. I said this is ridiculous and I got up and left.

Our friends now believe it was very low of me to get up and leave and how I should just be polite and stay there.

UPDATE AITA for kicking my brother and his family out after his son stole my engagement ring?,"My [OG Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tzyzd1/aita_for_kicking_my_brother_and_his_family_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So many of you have asked nonstop for an update, sorry it took me a while to log back on but lots of stuff have been going on. 

Yes I found the ring!! It was a stressful day doing a deeper search in my house trying to think like my nephew and looking in places where I think he’d hide something if he really didn’t want it to be found. And the decision was if it really wasn’t found and my brother wasn’t able to get him to talk, or they wouldn’t be able to pay back what I’m owed then the police would get involved. He did beg me not to but I told him then you better pray I find it or you come up with the money to pay me for it. 

Guess both our prayers worked because guess where I found it? In the freaking sink. The SINK. And that’s thanks to the comments who told me to look in those places. Idk what I would’ve done otherwise. It was the sink that was in their guest room, I’m glad he didn’t just throw it away. 

You guys don’t know how freaking relieved I was to find it. Took some work to remove the p trap under the sink to get it out but I was just so happy to find it!! Same night my girlfriend (fiancée 😉) got back I proposed to her and she said yes!! After a nice romantic dinner just the two of us at home…
The plan was to wait but after all this shit I thought fuck it I’m proposing ASAP before anything else happens 😅🤣

After my brother heard about me finding the ring he thought this meant they could come back. I said no. He wanted to argue about this again. All I told him was he’s lucky I haven’t gone to the cops since there was already video evidence of his son taking the ring and there’s no way I’m letting them back in when my nephew wouldn’t even say what he did with the ring. I talked with my nephew myself after I found the ring but he just said he didn’t want to tell anyone because then I’d be mad at him for hiding it. Honestly I just don’t have the energy for them anymore, his problem is their problem and hopefully they get him help before it’s too late. 

Only thing important to me is my fiancée and I starting our lives and planning our wedding 😁 Thank you Reddit for your help!! Seriously you guys were my life savers 😅

Edit to add: I just received this news after already submitting my post for approval and just wanted to add because I’m so happy, but girlfriend also informed me she’s pregnant!!! 😆😆 She found out while she was on her trip and was waiting for a good time to tell me.

"AITA for laughing hysterically after my husband called me ""housewife"" and embarrasing him infront of coworkers?","

My husband invited his new coworkers over for dinner. When they arrived he introduced me by gesturing at me and saying ""this is mrs Smith (didn't even say my name)...the housewife!"".

I looked at him for a second then I started laughing hysterically. I then told said ""no honey I work full time and YES I still act like a housewife when I'm home because you simply can't bother to help"". His co workers were staring at him as he tried to laugh and change the subject and ask what they wanted to drink.

Dinner went super awkward with him giving me looks and stares. Once the guests left he blew up saying I embarrassed him by laughing like a lunatic and then making the comment I made infront of his new coworks and ruining his image. I told him he was wrong to lie about my status and deny my degree to begin with. He said I could've talked to him about it privately later but not like this, and making his coworkers think he's useless.

He stormed off and has been quiet the entire night.

AITA for demanding my husband to pay me the $1000 dollars he spent behind my back?,"My husband (33) and I (31) used to have a 2 income home but in 2020 we've lost our home and one of our incomes (his). We moved into a smaller apartment, had to sell many things and give up most of our ""costly"" habits.

My husband has an expensive habit of going to the spa for a weekly massage session. we live in an urban area so this stuff is ridiculously expensive. A single session is 250$, and he has to have it every week so that'd be nearly 1000 a month!. I offered him to have his session at a regular spa but no, he has to get it from that luxurious spa near the restaurant we used to go saying the lady who gives the massage is an expert and he's used to her.

Problem is I'm the only income earner and I'm struggling to make ends meet. I'm also pregnant and need to save money to prepare a nursery. I told him to cut his sessions but he refused. I told him I won't be paying for them anymore and he said he'd get the money himself.

Yesterday I checked and saw that he's been using my credit card for his sessions for a whole month and had maxed out completely. I found that out when I went shopping for baby essentials and the cashier said I had no money. I had to return everything then went home and went off on him. I told him he maxed my card out and made me look like an idiot at the store, he said he didn't tell me cause he knew I'd have an issue with it. I demanded he pay back the $1000 he spent but he refused, I yelled at him calling him irresponsible and he got upset and called me selfish and told me to stop playing victim and that this is affecting both of us since he's going to be a parent too and it's stressful for him and I keep dismissing his own needs as a human.

I went upstairs and he went out.

AITA for telling my sister there’s a reason her kids chose to live with their dad?,"Throwaway. I (32F) have a 14 year old daughter Jess. Her father and my husband died in an accident when she was young, so it’s been just us two for a long time. As a result we are very close and she’s a lot more open to me then most kids are with their parents. Around a week ago she asked me if I could take her to the movies on a date with a guy in her class. I know the guy distantly because they’ve done some extra curriculars together and I was thrilled he was my daughters first ‘boyfriend’. I took them a few days ago and they ended up hanging out at our house for a bit afterwards. He was extremely polite and maybe it’s just the mum inside me but I couldn’t be happier for her. 

I went to my older sisters house for coffee earlier this morning. Backstory, my sister has two teenagers (16 and 17), who live almost full time with their dad. They had a very messy divorce around three years ago, and both kids choose to live with their dad. The reason for this was because my sister was extremely over bearing on them. She was the kind of mum who believed kids should have no privacy and she should run their lives until they were adults. I know she had many arguments with them because she would take away their doors, not let them hang out with friends, search through their phones every night etc. This was the primary reason for her divorce, although she won’t admit that. While I love her, as someone who grew up with little privacy I fully understand why her kids don’t want to live with her. 

My daughter came up in conversation and so bought up her first date. When I explained how it went, my sister laughed and told me that I must be joking. When she realised I was serious, she told me I was a terrible mother for letting my daughter walk all over me and not setting boundaries. She ranted on for a while but she basically said that 14 year olds are incapable of going out themselves and that I was being lazy and neglectful by allowing her to do that. She also said ‘I would never allow my kids to do that,’ so I replied by saying ‘That’s exactly why your kids drive with their dad.’ She got very quiet and then told me to leave. When I got home I started thinking more about what I said and while at the time I thought I was simply telling her what she needed to hear, now I’m wondering if I crossed the line.",23591,w3hz2u,"NTA.

"AITA for cancelling dinner when my boyfriend brought a bell to the diner to ""grab"" the staff's attention?","


This might sound bad but I don't know if I was TA here.


I (F30) have been dating my boyfriend Rhett (M31) for 4 months, we live in different town and he's not from here, (he's american living here) he usually visits on the weekends, This time I decided to visit his town and eat out at a diner.


Rhett was already there when I arrived to the diner, we talked some, checked the menu, then when it was time to order he pulled a small bell out of his jacket pocket, lifted it up then started shaking it. it produced a loud, annoying sound my ears started hurting. I was so confused I asked what he was doing and he said that he was trying to get one of the waiter staff's attention. I said it was embarrassing and he should stop right then but he kept shaking it. I can not begin to explain the looks we received from everyone.

I demanded him to stop but he said not til someone came and took our order. I threatened to leave the place and cancel dinner if he wouldn't and he kept doing it. Someone came already, but I'd already gotten up, took my purse and started making my way out. He followed me and started arguing about walking out but I told him that I couldn't take being embarrassed by him and he got upset and said that he didn't get why I thought the bell was embarrassing, explained that it was a perfect solution for no longer be forced to wait til someone shows up. I asked if it was acceptable to do this in america and he said ""yes because it's a free country and people there usually don't give a shit"" but I said it's inappropriate and embarrasding here. he said I was being too sensitive and overreacted over nothing. He insisted we go back inside but I refused.



We ended up leaving, he kept on about how I ruined dinner by cancelling it and offending him by acting like his behavior is shamful. I said I had a right to give an opinion on what he's done even if he thought what he was doing  but he basically told me to get off my high horse and stop calling his ""genius"" idea embarrassing.

AITA for refusing to dye my daughter’s hair because her school complained?,"My daughter(15F) dyed her hair dark reddish brown for her birthday.I didn’t let her dye her hair in middle school but said she could in high school. The school has a dress code for hair that just specified “natural hair colors only”. Which I took to mean browns, blondes, reds, black etc basically natural tones. Her natural hair is black but I don’t think it’s much of a change. The hairdresser that did a bleaching on her hair said it was not lighten enough to cause significant damage. 

But then one of the teachers in the beginning of the oct last year began complaining to me during parent teacher meetings that her hair didn’t meet dress code. I said her hair color grew out of people’s heads so why was it out of dress code? She told me it was clearly not her natural color and I shot back tons of her students that I saw that evening had blonde hair and highlights when they clearly natural brunettes. She claimed they look like they could be blonde but my daughter’s hair was suppose to be black. My daughter is Asian so it’s pretty racist to say she can’t dye her hair and I brought it up with the principle but he agreed with her saying it was against dress code. But I saw tons of white kids in her class with obviously brown hair that dyed it blonde and even red but no one said anything. They want me to darken her hair again so it looks “natural”. 

This went on until the end of the school year. I contacted the superintendent several times but she never got back to me. It’s almost the start of school again and I get an email from the principle reminding me my daughter is only allowed black hair. She still has her reddish brown hair and doesn’t want to dye it back. But I’ve tried to fight it and the last thing to do is to barge into the superintendents office and demand she get involved.",23558,wzhipd,"NTA.

UPDATE: AITA for not waking my partner up and causing him to miss a family trip?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uuhzi2/aita_for_not_waking_my_partner_up_and_causing_him/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

After posting this I received messages expressing concern and advice so I thought I'd update about how things turned out.

The morning after this incident my partner got out of bed when the kids did and took the older girls out for breakfast. Later I asked him if he'd be willing to read the thread and he agreed. He was very subdued afterwards, and didn't say much except for agreeing that he was an AH. The next day he took off work and saw his GP, started on anti-depressants, and we had a long talk.

He was ashamed by how he was acting and to see strangers comparing him to children. He cried when realised how much he was letting everyone down, especially his daughters who will grow up thinking this is normal behaviour.

He confirmed that this all started when we lived with his parents a few years back. He left home at 17 to get away from his mother, and she told him he'd fail as men need a woman to look after them. He felt like a failure so it was easy for his mother to feed him other ideas, and she would also manipulate things I did to look like he was incompetent as a person (eg. I'd tell him to relax and I'd handle the dishes, and his mother twisted it into me thinking he was incompetent) so he should just stop helping at all. He'd wake up feeling useless, and she managed to convince him that he was unhappy because I wasn't taking care of him the way a wife should.

He decided to got no contact with her which didn't go well. She cried and told him he was a horrible son for abandoning his mother, and that I was trying to control him by 'forcing' him to do it. He blocked her but she'd just use different numbers to continue calling him. After a week or so he ended up changing his number, and we haven't heard from his family since.

He bought up that he was unhappy at work as it wasn't stimulating enough, but he felt like he couldn't leave. I offered to pick up some part time work but he said no. He talked to his boss and took some time off, and eventually quit.

He spoke to my dad who used some connections and got him a good job at his company. The new job is a primarily work from home position, so he is able to help with the girls more and has more free time. He is able to take the girls to school and watch them play while he works which they all enjoy.

Before he started the new job he booked a trip for us to go to the snow for a week. We had a blast and it was lovely to see him relaxed and happy and enjoying our girls and life. He's promised to be more honest about how he's feeling and our relationship has improved immensely.

AITA for refusing to help my partner financially?,"I(43F) have been with my partner(50M) for 6 years now. We have been living together for 5 of them. We are not married and we do not plan to marry in the future.

I have a son(19M) that is currently a highschool senior. My partner has a daughter(21F) who is going to college.

The background you need to understand the issue: when I met my partner I was a widow of 3 years. I am lucky enough to have a very lucrative business and some family money. Also my late husband left a substantial estate, including the house we live in. The house is a family home so it passed to my son as the only heir.
My partner also makes good money and the difference in our lifestyles was pretty much negligible.

But while I and my late husband made sure to not spoil our son (he was responsible for keeping his room clean even though we have a house keeper, he had chores during the weekends, we taught him how to cook, his allowance is reasonable, he has to save for expensive purchases like a car, a PS5...etc). My current partner and his ex-wife spoil their daughter rotten.

Due to an incident when we first moved in together (she demanded my son's bedroom since it was the second biggest, got rejected since it was his home and she only spends the weekend), and after some family therapy we agreed that she will be treated like a guest by me. She will have to follow the house rules and that it the extent of our relationship.

Now while she is spoiled she is a good girl, academically excellent, except for the aforementioned incident very respectful and just a pleasant young woman.

The probelm is that I did not know the extent to which my partner spent money on her. He pays some money as ""rent"" that I put into my son's college fund and we split the common bills in half. Everything else is our own responsibility so we don't know much about each other's finances.

Now my son is planning to do a tour of east Asia during the summer and I was happy to give him the money to do so (as a gift for getting into a very prestigious college). When my stepdaughter heard about it she asked her dad to pay for a tour of Europe since he didn't send her on one after she got into college.

He agreed because he never says no, but he came to me asking me to lend him close to $30k because he can't afford the trip on his own. I am not even giving that much to my son and his plane tickets are more expensive.

I refused. I said that since this wasn't an emergency he can save and send her on the trip after she graduates college.

AITA for telling my husband off for wanting me to let my infertile BIL and his wife experience child birth by being with me in the delivery room?,"


Pleased read the full story.

My husband's brother (BIL 37) and his wife (SIL 35) struggled with infertility for years after trying so much for long they decided to stop. But started...sort of living the experience of having a child by doing the things that parents do like getting a nursery (they removed it now) buying bany cothes, toys, attending school shows etc etc.


I'm 7 months pregnant, and BIL & SIL has been asking many questions on what's it like to be expecting. It was bothersome with them getting involved but I grin & bear til they requested to be with me in the delivery room to experience child birth. I said no and stood firm but later discovered that my husband ""volunteered"" his place to give his brother and his wife both a chance to have this experience. We had a fight and I told him off.

BIL & SIL came over later to try to ""talk me"" into it, I nicely said no but they pushed me so I blew up telling them their fertility problems aren't my fault (harsh I know and regret saying it) and told them to get therapy. Sil started crying, Bil asked me take time to think but I rudely said there was nothing to think about and my mind's already been made. 


They left and my husband starte raging, after yelling at me about how this is his child too and how rude and dismissive I was to his grieving and strugglig brother and wife, he told me to look him in the eyes and tell him if I would be happy to ruin his brother's marriage when I can do this small, yet graceful deed and help BIL and wife ""process"" their trauma and finally make peace with it. I felt so much anger I cried, he told me to get over myself already and stop being purposefully selfish and petty.

We're not talking now and he says it stays this way til I say yes, I might've acted cruel but I just wanted him as the father of my child to be with me and don't feel comfortable with BIL & SIL being there.",23387,tuh1hm,"NTA.

AITA for telling my step-mom that she can use the missing child-support payments to fund my part of my dad's gift?,"Sorry for the wordy title, my (18M) dad left my mom when I was 6 (not because of my step-mom), four years ago he met and married my SM Aida, she had 3 kids from a previous marriage that my dad loved to parent instead of me, after they got together I saw him, at best, 7-8 times every year because they moved 5 hour away. A year later he had ''a change of heart'' and demanded his 50/50 custody, which made me miserable, he built a room for me at his new house, tried to fill the missing years with new gifts, even planned a big birthday party for my 12th birthday, at 13, I stopped going to his place. 

For me, he wasn't my dad. After he left, mom's brother (who was only 25 at the time) took me in as one of his boys, mom and I moved back to  my grandparents place and my uncle lived next door, he already had a kid, and he was always there for me, he's my father while my aunt is like a second mother for me and my cousin is like the brother I never had. When I stopped going to my bio-dad's my mom had to get a second job so I used to sleep at my uncle's pretty much every day, I didn't understand why until last year, when my grandma told me my dad had stopped paying child support out of spite and my mom didn't had the money to take him to court. 

Ever since I turned 15, father's day is about my uncle for me, my cousin and I make him breakfast and plan a fun day with him with a small gift, now that I'm 18, my step-mom sent me a fb message saying that I'm old enough to give my part for my bio-dad's gift, this year, his step-kids wants to give him a car and that I should put 10% (like 1,800 to 2,100).

AITA for not inviting my kid's whole class to his birthday party?,"I(28F) am a mother of a wonderful 8 years old son. This whole thing happened last April, but I am still getting complaints. So here I am asking strangers for a judgement on the internet.

So last year was my kid's first year in ""big kids' school"" like he calls it, since his first grade coincided with the pandemic. We are not in the best place financially; like most families, our consumer debt piled on and we are throwing every spare cent at it.

So when it was time to throw him a party, I only invited 5 of his classmates, the ones he considered his friends. For the others I sent 2 dozen cupcakes and juice boxes to class.

The invites were delivered to their houses and not in front of the other kids.

Like I said, money was tight so I got creative. I made 9 small cakes (box cakes, vanilla, chocolate and funfetti), buttercream in different colours. Also made big sugar cookies and different coloured frosting and sprinkles. And finally bought tortillas, made pizza sauce and had a variety of toppings. I asked that the kids bring swimsuits and water guns.

We had a make your own pizza station for lunch, then they played with their water guns. Then they decorated their cakes and finally their cookies to take home with them. That was a Saturday.

Well the next Monday, the kids would not stop raving about how fun the party was, how it was the best birthday party ever. The other kids were not happy to not be invited.

At pick up Tuesday, a couple moms confronted me about not inviting their kids. I said that I am sorry, but it was a small party for his close friends only. They kept complaining about me excluding their kids.

I didn't take it seriously then, but now it is a new school year, almost 6 month later, and I am still getting the occasional comment thrown at me. So AITA?",23346,wy7cud,"NTA. You did everything right. You sent treats for the class, you sent invitations to private homes rather than inviting kids at school, and it sounds like you gave your son a fantastic, creative party on a shoestring budget.

AITA for announcing the reason why I didn't invite my brother to my wedding and exposing him to the entire family?,"

I (M30) got married 2 weeks ago. I was married before but it ended after I found out that my older brother Thomas (M34) got involved with my first wife. It was devastating because we were close and had a great relationship. I also helped him so much while he was struggling and seeing how he repaid me hurts to this very day. 

I stopped talking to him and Mom and dad forced me to keep it a secret and because I was too weak to argue with them, I just kept my owm distance.


Then I met my now wife. my family loved and embraced her as their own. mom and dad treat her like a queen which helped repaire and soldified my relationship with them. However, as the wedding was approaching they told me they expected me to invite Thomas. I of course refused but they kept guilting me about what the relatives and other guests would think and say when they don't see Thomas there. I fought with them about it til the day of the wedding. Turned out they'd invited him behind my back but I found out and stopped them in time.



They came to the wedding looking pissed asking what we were going to tell people when they ask about Thomas. I told them I'd take care of it. and what I did was take a moment while everyone was paying attention, grabbed the mic and flatout announced this and said ""the reason I didn't invite Thomas to my wedding is because I was worried he'd steal my now wife just like he stole the first one"" I said it playfully to not make it sound so tense but most of the guests looked shocked and started mumbling then it went awkwardly quiet for a moment. then we moved on but I saw Mom and Dad walk out while looking at me grudgingly.


Later they started lashing out about how I just exposed Thomas and caused him to be shunned by the family in the most hideos of ways. I told them that I already said I didn't want him there yet they tried to push him on me repeatedly saying ""what are people going to say"" so I told them the reason why he wasn't there in a playful way but they (the guests) still got the message. Mom started yelling about how everyone will now look down on and shun Thomas, she called me pathetic and cruel for still punishing him and gradually ruining his life despite him apologizing and trying to reconcile but in my opinion? somethings are just unforgivable.

Unbeknowest to me, my boys (16) & (12) decided to pull a funny prank and mess with the birthday cake that they made for her. Instead of adding icing on the cake, they added mayonnaise. It didn't go well and my SD's reaction was to cry. My husband blew up at the boys for what they did but they said they were just trying to prank her since it's the norm and they always prank each others. My husband said it was the wrong time to do this on her birthday especially after getting out of the hospital. He told the boys they ruined her birthday but I told him he exaggarated with this statement. He got upset and yelled at me for defending this behavior and being an enbler.

They did not do a great job with her and she has a lot of problems.  She is chronically unemployed and she is a thief.  

She has two kids that are okay. They live with us as well because her boyfriend didn't want them around.  I like the kids but they are spoiled little brats my parents dote on to make up for being shitty parents to their mom.  

My parents won't let me put a lock on my door because it is their house and they don't want that.  No problem. I talked to the kids and explained about what would happen if they came into my room without permission. We have an understanding.  

Well my sister broke up with her boyfriend and she needed a place to stay. I begged my parents not to let her stay with us.  They declined. So I begged again for a lock for my door. No dice. 

I have to go to school so I can't guard my stuff at all times.  When I came home on Friday I found my car absolutely trashed and the side of it destroyed.  

My sister had gone into my room, found my spare key and taken my car.  Then lost control on the ice after a day of eating crap and tossing fast food wrappers everywhere. She sideswiped a tree. 

When I saw my car I was livid.  I told my parents that I expected her to pay to fix it.  They said she didn't have any money. So I said that I would call my grandparents. They had helped me get the car and insurance.  

After talking with my grandfather I came back to talk to my parents.  I said that the insurance would cover fixing or replacing my car depending on the damage. But that I would have to file a police report. And that my sister would probably be charged for stealing my car.  They begged me to tell insurance that she had permission.  I said nope. 

So rather than go through insurance they are replacing my car. But they are using money that they had sett aside to take me and my nieces to Orlando next summer for my graduation.  It's fine. I can do without seeing Disney World again.  But my parents, sister, and nieces are upset with me and saying that I'm an asshole for denying my nieces the opportunity to go on a vacation that they have never had.  

I just asked them if a lock for my door would have been cheaper.  

AITA?

AITA for getting angry when my partner announced she’s pregnant?,"My partner (34f) and I (28m) have been together for 5 years. She has a daughter (8) from a previous relationship. Right off the bat, it was made known I had fertility issues and likely wouldn’t ever be able to father a child. I moved slow in the relationship, although I had fallen in love with her fast. When things got serious, I overheard her telling her sister she was concerned that I might be an ‘aggressive type’ person because of the amount of scars I have. I didn’t want her scared away so I told her I had a bad childhood and left it at that. 

A little over two years into our relationship, I felt somewhat comfortable opening up and for the first time I told her exactly why I’m infertile which is a direct result of an injury I suffered due to trauma as a child. She was really empathetic and I was just thankful I had found the one I want to spend my life with that also came with a kid I adore. 

Fast forward to last summer. My partner and her friend decided to play an impromptu prank on me. I came home from work, there were multiple positive pregnancy tests in the bathroom. My partner announced she was pregnant, I started freaking out…a happy freak out cause I thought I had hit the lottery with the slim to none chance I have. They both started laughing, the tests were from the friend and not my partner. 

I was pretty much devastated and felt really let down that my partner would actually pull a prank like that. At first she was shocked by my reaction and said, “I thought you’d know it was a joke considering your circumstances.” She ended up apologizing after realizing how hurt I was. 

Now for the point of the post. Three weeks ago she arranged a huge dinner with her entire family at our house. She had us play this stupid mystery game and ultimately announced to everyone she’s pregnant. Her mother and sisters were deliriously happy. Immediately I got pissed thinking this was yet another prank, so I showed absolutely no emotions which everyone caught on to. I said to my partner, “Either you’re just mentally disturbed or you’re cheating.” That’s pretty much when all hell broke loose. 

My partner’s POV is that she was sincerely apologetic about the prank and I should know her well enough to not think she’d ever pull that stunt again. She’s also livid at me for ruining the announcement, embarrassing her in front of her entire family, causing them to think I’m a horrible person and then finally insinuating that she’s a cheater. 

I still stand by my claim that had she never pranked me, my reaction would have been different. I do find it odd she decided to tell me along with her family. Things would have likely went over better had she told me first, and then we announced it together. But I’m starting to think I acted immaturely causing scene in front of her family, and I think that’s maybe where I’m wrong.",23302,wau52s,Who the fuck announces pregnancy to their partner and family AT THE SAME TIME???,500,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wau52s/aita_for_getting_angry_when_my_partner_announced/,"['partner', 'together', 'years', 'has', 'daughter', 'previous', 'relationship', 'right', 'bat', 'was', 'made', 'known', 'fertility', 'issues', 'likely', 'ever', 'able', 'father', 'child', 'moved', 'slow', 'relationship', 'although', 'fallen', 'love', 'fast', 'things', 'got', 'serious', 'overheard', 'telling', 'sister', 'was', 'concerned', 'might', '‘', 'aggressive', 'type', 'person', 'because', 'amount', 'scars', 'want', 'scared', 'away', 'told', 'bad', 'childhood', 'left', 'little', 'two', 'years', 'relationship', 'felt', 'somewhat', 'comfortable', 'opening', 'first', 'time', 'told', 'exactly', 'why', 'im', 'infertile', 'direct', 'result', 'injury', 'suffered', 'due', 'trauma', 'child', 'was', 'really', 'empathetic', 'was', 'thankful', 'found', 'one', 'want', 'spend', 'life', 'also', 'came', 'kid', 'adore', 'fast', 'forward', 'last', 'summer', 'partner', 'friend', 'decided', 'play', 'impromptu', 'prank', 'came', 'home', 'work', 'multiple', 'positive', 'pregnancy', 'tests', 'bathroom', 'partner', 'announced', 'was', 'pregnant', 'started', 'freaking', 'out…', 'happy', 'freak', 'cause', 'thought', 'hit', 'lottery', 'slim', 'none', 'chance', 'started', 'laughing', 'tests', 'friend', 'partner', 'was', 'pretty', 'much', 'devastated', 'felt', 'really', 'let', 'partner', 'would', 'actually', 'pull', 'prank', 'like', 'first', 'was', 'shocked', 'reaction', 'said', 'thought', 'know', 'was', 'joke', 'considering', 'circumstances', 'ended', 'apologizing', 'realizing', 'hurt', 'was', 'point', 'post', 'three', 'weeks', 'ago', 'arranged', 'huge', 'dinner', 'entire', 'family', 'house', 'us', 'play', 'this', 'stupid', 'mystery', 'game', 'ultimately', 'announced', 'everyone', 'shes', 'pregnant', 'mother', 'sisters', 'deliriously', 'happy', 'immediately', 'got', 'pissed', 'thinking', 'this', 'was', 'yet', 'another', 'prank', 'showed', 'absolutely', 'emotions', 'everyone', 'caught', 'said', 'partner', 'either', 'youre', 'mentally', 'disturbed', 'youre', 'cheating', 'thats', 'pretty', 'much', 'hell', 'broke', 'loose', 'partners', 'pov', 'was', 'sincerely', 'apologetic', 'prank', 'know', 'well', 'enough', 'think', 'shed', 'ever', 'pull', 'stunt', 'shes', 'also', 'livid', 'ruining', 'announcement', 'embarrassing', 'front', 'entire', 'family', 'causing', 'think', 'im', 'horrible', 'person', 'finally', 'insinuating', 'shes', 'cheater', 'still', 'stand', 'claim', 'never', 'pranked', 'reaction', 'would', 'different', 'find', 'odd', 'decided', 'tell', 'along', 'family', 'things', 'would', 'likely', 'went', 'better', 'told', 'first', 'announced', 'together', 'im', 'starting', 'think', 'acted', 'immaturely', 'causing', 'scene', 'front', 'family', 'think', 'thats', 'maybe', 'im', 'wrong']",partner together years has daughter previous relationship right bat was made known fertility issues likely ever able father child moved slow relationship although fallen love fast things got serious overheard telling sister was concerned might ‘ aggressive type person because amount scars want scared away told bad childhood left little two years relationship felt somewhat comfortable opening first time told exactly why im infertile direct result injury suffered due trauma child was really empathetic was thankful found one want spend life also came kid adore fast forward last summer partner friend decided play impromptu prank came home work multiple positive pregnancy tests bathroom partner announced was pregnant started freaking out… happy freak cause thought hit lottery slim none chance started laughing tests friend partner was pretty much devastated felt really let partner would actually pull prank like first was shocked reaction said thought know was joke considering circumstances ended apologizing realizing hurt was point post three weeks ago arranged huge dinner entire family house us play this stupid mystery game ultimately announced everyone shes pregnant mother sisters deliriously happy immediately got pissed thinking this was yet another prank showed absolutely emotions everyone caught said partner either youre mentally disturbed youre cheating thats pretty much hell broke loose partners pov was sincerely apologetic prank know well enough think shed ever pull stunt shes also livid ruining announcement embarrassing front entire family causing think im horrible person finally insinuating shes cheater still stand claim never pranked reaction would different find odd decided tell along family things would likely went better told first announced together im starting think acted immaturely causing scene front family think thats maybe im wrong 
AITA? I reported my car missing after my husband took it to attend his brother's wedding.,"
My husband (35) does not have a car. He sold his old one to help pay for his brother's wedding. I did not agree on this but he had this car before we got together so it's a shared property. besides that I have my own car so that did not affect me til my husband started complaining about having to commute to work and hangout places. He tried to get me to let him drive my car several times but I stood firm and put a boundary making him understand that my car will never be driven by him (one of the reasons why is because of how bad his driving is).


His brother lives out of town. My husband asked if he could drive my car to the wedding but I refused but not because I'm not imvited (another story for another day) buy because like I said my car is off limits. He threw a fit calling me unreasonable to let him take public transportation because he can barely stand it for 10 minutes let alone hours.  I said it wasn't my problem which irritated him but made him stop arguing about it.


The day that he was supposed to travel out of town. I woke at 10am and couldn't find my car key. I went outside and couldn't find my car either. I was beyond pissed. I called him and like I expected, he took it and was on his way to the other town. I lost it and told him I gave him no permission to take it for whole 5 days and said that if he won't turn around with it and come home then I'd call the cops and report it missing. His response was ""You wouldn't dare do it cause you know what would happen"" I hung up on him then immediately called the police and told them about my situation. I did NOT tell them my husband took it because they'd think it's a family dispute and decide to not get involved. I just reported it missing.

2 hours later I got a call from my husband saying he was back in town and was being held at our local police station. I went to the station and talked to the cops. My husband made a scene there swearing over and over that I gave him permission to take it and said I was acting out of jealousy and spite because he was going to attent a wedding that I was not invited to. I took my car and went home but he had to stay a little longer.

He came home in the evening and went on a rage fit about how I created an awful situation and almost caused him to miss his brother's wedding. He called me vindictive, bitter and a lunatic to call the police on him and try to accuse him of stealing my car. He had to leave the same day to be able to be there with his family and decided to extent his stay and he still hasn't gotten back yet.

AITA for putting a private conversation on loud speaker which cost my brother his 18 year relationship,"Ok guys I’m extremely tried and it’s been a long ass day so please excuse any poor grammar or spelling mistakes 


To begin my brother Ben (39m fake name ) has been in a relationship with Abby(39 fake name) 18 years. They’ve been engaged 8 years they’ve nearly gotten married 3 years ago but months before the wedding Ben chickened out. 

They went to therapy and basically because our dad left us he has issues with commitment.
We thought over the last year he was finally gonna step up for Abby and be the partner she deserves. He did seem a bit anxious leading up to the big day but assured everyone he was ok 


Today they were meant to get married but as abby and us bridesmaids were about to enter the church Ben was no where to be found 

Everyone tried to calm her down saying it was traffic or he probably had a monster hangover.
Well an hour passed, than two, than three and than after the four hour mark Abby said fuck she was going back to the hotel call her when he landed.

My family looked panicked and nervous trying to get through to Ben or the groomsmen who had not arrived yet 

My other brothers and brother in laws (sister’s husband) went looking for him thinking he got hurt or arrested the night before 

I went back to the hotel with a very broken looking Abby. We drank and ate food for another hour before I got a text from my brother in law saying they found him in a bar and they were trying to talk him into GOING TO HIS OWN WEDDING. My sister rang her husband and heard him in the background  he was literally acting like a 5 year old who didn’t want to go to the doctor 

Honestly guys I had enough at this stage he mess this girl about too long and frankly leading someone along for 18 years is just cruel 


So he’s here’s were I maybe the asshole of the century. I walked into Abby’s room and told her be quiet than I rang my brother in law put him on loud speaker and asked him what was going on than for him to put Ben on the phone the drunk fool started saying shit like he didn’t think she was the one and he is only with her because they’ve been together to long and he is scared to be alone 

I let her hear everything I won’t lie I felt like a monster when she started crying. Abby than grabbed the phone told him he had one hour to get to the church or it was over for good 


Long story short Ben ended up at the Church 20 minutes later and Abby took off her dress than left the hotel alone 

So he ended being left a the Alter and she went on the honeymoon alone. I’ve been disowned by everyone expect two siblings (sisters) and I had to get Abby’s maid of honour to collect my suitcase from outside the hotel (mom dumped out when she found out)

AITA for refusing to watch my sister's stepkid and exposing her lies to her husband?,"

My f/21 sister Jess, f/30, is married and has a 5 yo stepson. her husband works full time and she is a sahm.


Every monday, she'd call my mom at 9am to get her to go over to her house and watch her stepkid for few hours, I live at home with my parents and so I've noticed this routine for weeks now.

Last week mom went out of town to visit some relatives, and yesterday (monday) at 9am my sister called asking me to come watch her stepkid for few hours because she had an important thing to do. I said no because I had to go study and also she does this every monday so clearly it wasn't important or urgent but she insisted it was, I told her sorry but no. She ended the call then I went to the university.


Hours later, I got a call from my brother in law asking where my sister was, I said I had no idea. he proceeded to tell me he just came home at 1pm and found his son by himself at the house. I was in shock that my sister left her stepkid by himself so she could go God knows where. I told him about the conversation I had with her and he got angry.

In the evening my sister came over and started making a scene by yelling at me for bailing on her after she sent me a text message telling me she was already out the house to force me to come watch her stepson. I didn't see the fb message til she told me but she said I did this deliberately and also, exposed her to her husband because she told him she'd be at home with the kid. Not just that, but I also told her husband that mom comes over every monday morning to watch the kid for few hours which caused a huge fight between him and my sister. She yelled that I was petty and selfish and just stirred shit and caused issues in her marriage by tattling to her husband. I couldn't keep arguing I went into my room and started playing music. My dad and the others said I was to blame for not helping my sister and now being the reason she and her husband are in conflict.


AITA?

Okay guys so I saw few questions asked multiple times so I'll just put the answers out here for all to see.

1) My brother in law's wife is deceased.

2) brother in law is always at work when my sister calls my mom to get her to come over and watch her stepson.

3) most of you guys are asking where my sister goes every monday, and I even saw someone mention that I was YTA for not finding out, but I don't know anything, I have no idea what's going with my sister and I thought it was non of my business.


UPDATE: Guys! I've decided to try and find out what is really going with Jess. I'm not the type to snoop and it's not my business but she already made it my business by turning the family against me because of something she did. Ngl I came here thinking I was going to get toast but I wrong, thank goodness for that. I'll update as soon as possible.

"AITA for tipping our waitress 20 dollars despite her poor service, because my date was playing a ""game"" with her tips?","I met a guy on a dating app, we hit it off and we arranged for our first date. Things were going well, we had sat down and had started some small chat. Our waitress comes over asking us what we want to order.

I say what I want and gesture to him so he can order. He orders and then pulls what I think is about 15 dollars on the table. He says ""This is your tip. Everytime you mess up, I take some away"".

The waitress looked nervous immediately. I'm sitting there a bit shocked, but mostly embarrassed because I wasn't expecting this. She must have been new as well, because she did spill some drinks on our table that night, gave us the wrong food, and overall just seemed lost. He took away 13 dollars. 

I asked him why he thought doing tips this way was a good idea. He said it was the best way to ensure ""good service"". When I disagreed he said ""Cant always be nice to these people, it's not a respectable job"".

I decided then that I wanted nothing to do with him, and called the waitress over to get the bill. I slapped a 20 dollar bill in her hand and got up to pay for my own meal. 

Later that night he had demanded to know why I had given her the tip despite her poor service and I told him it's because he decided to treat her livelihood like it was a game. He said because of me she'll never improve her service and that I'm just a people pleaser. 

I blocked him, but I've wondered ever since if that was really the right thing to do.

AITA for refusing to split rent with my boyfriend?,"I (F23) have been dating my boyfriend “Jake” (M23) since our freshmen year of college. In our last year of undergrad, we decided to rent an apartment together. We split everything 50/50, including utilities, groceries, and rent. We continued living together in the same town as our college after graduation, but recently, we both got jobs in Chicago and we are currently living downtown. My dad works in real estate, and he has multiple investment properties. My dad generously allowed me to live in one of his properties rent free, but he said that my boyfriend would have to pay him $400 a month for rent. My dad is very protective, but he has been nothing but kind to my boyfriend. My dads reasoning for making my boyfriend pay rent is that he wants to be sure that my boyfriend is with me for me, and not because he will have a free place to live. (Keep in mind, if my dad was renting this apartment out to tenants, he would charge $2100 a month for rent. Very ritzy building in the middle of downtown Chicago). 

My boyfriend is mad at me because he asked me for my half of the $400 for rent, and I explained to him that I will not be paying rent. My dad is only charging him. He says that we have been splitting rent for the past 2 years so why would we stop now? 

Our rent in our college town was $1200, so we were both paying $600 a month. Our apartment in Chicago is significantly nicer and he is paying $200 less a month than what he was in college. 

Is the idea that my DAD doesn’t charge me for rent, but charges my boyfriend so crazy? Should I suck it up and pay half because I can afford it?

EDIT: Jake and I still split utilities and groceries 50/50, and when we go out on date nights, we switch off who pays for it. If he pays one week, i’ll pay the next.",23188,xfsbsq,"NTA

A nice ritzy building - check

What more does your BF want? Clearly he’s not seeing the bigger picture. He’s getting a lot of perks because of you and he only has to pay a fraction of the rent. Doesn’t he realize that millions don’t have that luxury in these critical times of the economy?

AITA for tricking my husband into eating the food I cooked by making him think his mom sent it?,"My husband ""Mickey"" loves his mom's cooking. He always praises her for the food she makes and even mentioned it in his groom speech at the wedding!


I consider myself a good cook. In fact, I'm going to just say that I'm even better than his mom. but the problem is he doesn't even want to try my cooking or give me a chance to prove it, I thought this would change after marriage but 5 months later nothing's changed. What does he eat if he's not eating what I'm cooking? He has requested that his mom send him a meal everyday to eat for dinner after getting off work except for the weekend where we go over to her house and eats breakfast, lunch, dinner and DESSERT there. 


Every single day he'd come home and ask if his mom sent him a meal. I grew irritated of this and whenever I try to offer him to taste any of the (wasted) food I cook, he'd lay in bed and say he's full.


So I came up with an idea. I cooked him the same meal his mom sent him that day and put it aside til he got home. He asked if his mom sent a meal for dinner and I said yes and served him my own version of the meal - not hers. He didn't notice anything different. he ate the whole thing with no hasitation while I sat across from him asking him questions about how good the meal was. He went on and on praising it saying how perfect, exceptional it was, and how it was just what he needed after a long day at work.


I smiled and said ""You're welcome"". He froze and looked at me for a minute. Looked down at the plate then back at me and said ""wait, you made this didn't you?"" I said ""With my own hand and from scratch"". His face suddenly went red and he got upset and said that this was not cool. I told him he never even gave me a chance to show him how good my cooking is and that he's probably just used to his mom's cooking and is rejecting any other alternatives which's unfair to me. He said that I shouldn't have lied to him and basically tricked him into eating food that he had no idea where it came from. I said he liked it and admitted that it was good so what's the issue. He got up from his seat, threw the napkin and said that I was unbelievable then walked out.


He got quiet the rest if the evening then posted about it on his FB in a vague post about being tricked into eating ""someone's"" food like that. I felt guilty and bad thinking maybe I really shouldn't have done this but I was frusrtated with how he kept turning down every meal I tried to cook him and then say ""No thanks, I prefer mom's food"".

AITA for getting back the money my husband took from our IVF treatment and gave to his friend?,"
To start off I want to say that my husband (36M) has an old friend (33M) that he's known since highschool. they're inseperable and spend the entire week together. like they're really really close.

My husband and I struggled with fertility issues for years. we recently started new method (IVF) in hopes to get at least one child together. Note that I saved for the majority of treatment while my husband only paid 2-3 thousands. We saved up for another round after the huge disappointment and heartbreak from failing the first time (that's just how it goes). This time I'd put all the money (including dad's inhertance) and my husband didn't pay a cent.


Last week I found out that he secretly pulled out 7k (we had 11k in total). I was completely and utterly shocked I confronted him and he casually reminded me of how many times his best friend complained about his ""old junk"" car and he decided to ""lend"" him 7k to buy a decent car, his argument was that his friend would've done the same for him. I was beyond livid I asked if he really thought that was okay and he said that I shouldn't worry and guaranteed his friend will pay us back in time. I lost it on him and immediately demanded his friend to send the money back and threatened police involvement in case he refused. His friend immediately returned the money but told my husband about the polic thing and my husband came home and yelled at me calling me unhinged and selfish. I told him I saved up some of this money/used my inheritance for this treatment while he contributed nothing even though we're in this together. He ""corrected"" me saying I'm the one with the problem and he thought it's only fair that I ""make up"" for it by paying for the IVF myself. This hurt so badly and I couldn't argue anymore. He went to stay with his friend while constantly shaming me for how I treated them both and for the police invovlement like they stole from me or something.",23100,vm861k,"NTA and I think it's evident at this point you are no longer in a committed relationship. Your husband has finally revealed several things to you. Something I don't think you realize that he revealed is that he no longer thinks you will have a child no matter what. If he was in it to have a child he wouldn't have pulled that money out to begin with. It was a hit or miss on whether or not the friend could repay that 7 k in time. If he needed it then its not something he can easily acquire back. On top of this your husband is now outwardly hurting you by saying you are the one with the problem and is effectively saying it isn't his fault. Your husband no longer wants to have a child with you. And his lack of cate and feelings for you, as well as how ready he was to steal money from you, just shows that this relationship is over. 

For your own mental safety I recommend leaving him and finding someone to love who is mentally available to take this journey with you.

AITA for refusing to put my fiance on the house title after he kept handing me empty pens as a prank?,"I F, 34 have been with my fiance M, 37 for 3 years. Getting married before the end of this year and recently moved in the house that I inherited from my mom. The house is in my name and it took a lot of talking and convincing from him to have his name on the title as well. Now honestly part of me doesn't think this is a good idea, at least not right now maybe after marriage? But anyway, I've decided to go ahead and put his name on the title so he could go ahead and start contributing towards mortgage more and light my burden a little bit. 

We've made appointments, decided on which form of ownership we were basing this on. when it was time for me to sign the deed, My fiance stopped me and gave me a pen saying this pen was his ""lucky"" pen and told me to use it to sign the deed. I took it and tried to sign but turned out it was empty. He was like ""oh I must've forgotten"" while laughing and then pulled out his ""other lucky pen"". I took it, tried to sign and that one too was empty. Honestly, seeing how he was laughing I figured he was messing with me but he swore he wasn't and pulled out ANOTHER one of his lucky pens. I tried that one too and it was empty. my fiance started cackling and I felt humiliated especially with how the gentleman next to him was staring. I got pissed and asked him what that was about and he said it was a prank. I asked ""really? Did you really think this was a time for pranks?"" He was like ""it's alright you can use ""a real pen"" now"". I pushed the paper away and said ""you know what? Never mind because I no longer want you on the deed"". He lost it completely saying we had a deal and I can't back out of it just like that, and that it was a stupid joke that I took too seriously. We had an argument and I refused to sign the deed at least not then and there. 

At home he blew up again saying I was the one who ""delayed the process"" and that he already gave me a real pen and all I had to do was sign the ""damn paper"" and get it over with. He accused me of looking for an excuse not to have him on the deed and started the silent treatment saying there's nothing to say til those papers are signed.

Did I really take this too seriously?",23043,w4gcao,"Please don't add him. He pressured you before marriage and after your bereavement -  he should be supporting you.

Put the house into a trust,  that will protect it and get a pre nup to protect your asset. Not legally binding in the UK at the moment but influences a divorce decision.

Personally I wouldn't marry him because of the pressure exerted when you are most vulnerable and the stupid prank at a legal appointment when it's costing you several hundred pounds for the advice and actual appointment. He uses this to humiliate you.

AITA for doing the absolute minimum chores after my girlfriend parents implied I wasn't a man and she agreed with them?,"Sorry if some of sentences feel awkward, I am not a native speaker.
I work from home and my job is relaxed and doesn't require me to be glued to the screen, my girlfriend works in a stressful customer service job and most of her days are terrible. In the 2 years we've been living together, I do practically all the chores around the house and I try to treat her to like a queen when she comes back home. However, the one thing I can't do is be a handyman no matter how easy the task is. A few months ago, the bathroom door hinges needed replacing so I called a friend to help.

Last week during lunch with her parents, I asked her dad about the project he was working on (he does woodworking as a hobby). He showed me the progress on his phone and suggested I should help him with the last touches.

My girlfriend told him that I can't even replace door hinges let alone help with that. Her mom said that every man should know how to fix things around the house and her husband agreed with her. The remainder of lunch was very awkward, it was like they were my real parents and were disappointed of me for being a huge failure.

After we left, I told my girlfriend that I didn't expect their reaction. Instead of taking my side, she said that they were right because it was embarrassing that I need to call a friend to help with something trivial.

I reminded her that I get nervous and anxious everytime I touch a tool. I admitted it was stupid but it's just the way I am and has been very honest with her since the start. Still she didn't change her mind.

I told her that since their idea of being a man is twisted I must share the same view and start working on being their version of a man. I told her that I will stop cooking for her. And I'll stop doing the dishes, laundry and cleaning. The only thing that I would keep doing is taking the trash out and grocery shopping. So I could focus my time and effort on becoming a man.",23027,v29a8c,Why would you stay with someone who speaks of you like that to their family?,3764,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v29a8c/aita_for_doing_the_absolute_minimum_chores_after/,"['sorry', 'sentences', 'feel', 'awkward', 'native', 'speaker', 'work', 'home', 'job', 'relaxed', 'require', 'glued', 'screen', 'girlfriend', 'works', 'stressful', 'customer', 'service', 'job', 'days', 'terrible', 'years', 'weve', 'living', 'together', 'practically', 'chores', 'around', 'house', 'try', 'treat', 'like', 'queen', 'comes', 'back', 'home', 'however', 'one', 'thing', 'cant', 'handyman', 'matter', 'easy', 'task', 'months', 'ago', 'bathroom', 'door', 'hinges', 'needed', 'replacing', 'called', 'friend', 'help', 'last', 'week', 'during', 'lunch', 'parents', 'asked', 'dad', 'project', 'was', 'working', 'does', 'woodworking', 'hobby', 'showed', 'progress', 'his', 'phone', 'suggested', 'help', 'last', 'touches', 'girlfriend', 'told', 'cant', 'even', 'replace', 'door', 'hinges', 'let', 'alone', 'help', 'mom', 'said', 'every', 'man', 'know', 'fix', 'things', 'around', 'house', 'husband', 'agreed', 'remainder', 'lunch', 'was', 'very', 'awkward', 'was', 'like', 'real', 'parents', 'disappointed', 'being', 'huge', 'failure', 'left', 'told', 'girlfriend', 'expect', 'reaction', 'instead', 'taking', 'side', 'said', 'right', 'because', 'was', 'embarrassing', 'need', 'call', 'friend', 'help', 'something', 'trivial', 'reminded', 'get', 'nervous', 'anxious', 'everytime', 'touch', 'tool', 'admitted', 'was', 'stupid', 'its', 'way', 'has', 'very', 'honest', 'since', 'start', 'still', 'change', 'mind', 'told', 'since', 'idea', 'being', 'man', 'twisted', 'must', 'share', 'view', 'start', 'working', 'being', 'version', 'man', 'told', 'stop', 'cooking', 'ill', 'stop', 'doing', 'dishes', 'laundry', 'cleaning', 'only', 'thing', 'would', 'keep', 'doing', 'taking', 'trash', 'grocery', 'shopping', 'could', 'focus', 'time', 'effort', 'becoming', 'man']",sorry sentences feel awkward native speaker work home job relaxed require glued screen girlfriend works stressful customer service job days terrible years weve living together practically chores around house try treat like queen comes back home however one thing cant handyman matter easy task months ago bathroom door hinges needed replacing called friend help last week during lunch parents asked dad project was working does woodworking hobby showed progress his phone suggested help last touches girlfriend told cant even replace door hinges let alone help mom said every man know fix things around house husband agreed remainder lunch was very awkward was like real parents disappointed being huge failure left told girlfriend expect reaction instead taking side said right because was embarrassing need call friend help something trivial reminded get nervous anxious everytime touch tool admitted was stupid its way has very honest since start still change mind told since idea being man twisted must share view start working being version man told stop cooking ill stop doing dishes laundry cleaning only thing would keep doing taking trash grocery shopping could focus time effort becoming man 
AITA for letting my MIL and SIL find our (hubby's and mine) bedroom toys because I suspected they snooped in my drawers?,"My (27F) husband (32M) and I have been dating for 6 years and married for 4, we have a 3 year old baby boy and since we don't plan on having more children, I told my husband that I wanted to get my boobs redone because I wanted them more perky and I had surgery last year. 

My MIL has always been sniffy because my husband is her only son, we've gone LC over the years because she's overbearing with him and dismissing with me, things got a little better when our baby was born, but after my surgery? oof, it's like I wrote in my forehead ''LOOK AT MY BOOBS, I WANT TO CHEAT ON MY HUSBAND'', she's always implying that I did it for male validation (yeah, your son's ffs), that I'll leave my husband, that I look like a hooker because I wear stuff that shows cleavage, that I could've gotten them a little smaller, everything. She also complaint about my clothes (and underwear) a lot, because ''no married woman with a child should dress like this''.

And see, that's what stung me because, how could she know? I suspected she was going in my drawers, but my husband told me that *she could never*, she made a comment about a cute set of lingerie that shows basically everything and I was confused, I asked how'd she knows I have it and she said ''she saw it in the washing machine'' but I prefer to wash my sets by hand so the lace last longer. Anyway, we recently changed our bedroom and I had an idea to put an end to this, when I was restocking my drawers, I used one in my vanity to put all of my husband's and mines sex toys, a few sets and a dirty letter he wrote to me once. My MIL visited us a few times and said nothing, so I did felt bad for accusing her, but yesterday she was here with my SIL and my husband and I were in the kitchen cooking for them. 

We heard my MIL calling us and when we went to our room they were standing next to my open drawer, I just snorted, looked at my husband and said ''see? she snoops.'' My husband got red in the face, berated my MIL and my SIL and they both left after calling me indecent. My husband is mad at them, but he's mad at me too because he says I shouldn't have set a trap for his family and is saying we three need to apologize to each other, so maybe AITA?",23023,u5u6fz,"NTA, you kept *your* stuff in *your* drawer in *your* house.

AITA for going into the ladies room?,"I am a 31 yo man and was at a large store yesterday with my 5mo son when he did what babies do. I went over to the restrooms and saw that there wasn't a family/companion restroom, just a men's and women's. I went into the men's room and saw there was a cubicle and a few urinals, but no changing table. The sink didn't have a counter either.

I walked out and hunted down an employee to ask where the changing table was. She said it was in the bathroom, and I asked where, assuming there was a family/companion restroom on the other side of the store. She took me back to where I just was. I asked if there was another bathroom, and she said no. I told her I was just in the bathroom and there was no changing table. She asked if I was sure and suggested I look again.

I was annoyed, but I went back in the men's room. No changing table. When I came out the employee was gone. Keep in mind, my son has been in his poopy diaper this whole time. So I give up and head into the lady's room which sure enough had a changing table. There was a woman in there washing her hands, and she said ""wrong bathroom, buddy.""

I gestured to my son and said ""no changing table in the men's room."" She laughed and said ""bro, that sucks."" Then she walked out. So I rush to change him, hoping to be done before anyone else walked in. I'm almost done when a woman walks in and starts screaming at me. I tried to explain what I was doing, but she kept screaming ""Get out! You can't be here!"" Then she ran out.

I finished putting the diaper on and rushed out of the bathroom. I saw the woman talking to an employee and decided to leave without my stuff. The employee tried to wave me down and stop me, but I rushed out to my car, buckled my son into his carseat and left.

My wife said I absolutely did the right thing, but my mom said I'm an idiot and was 100% in the wrong. My sister won't stop laughing at me and is no help at all.

AITA for refusing to give my partner the code to my safe?,"Update at the bottom 

Throwaway and usual mobile formatting apologies. 

I 32(f) and a Gemologist, I spend my days in the lab testing and identifying stones. From the nature of my work I also have a large and valuable collection of jewellery but also gem specimens that I keep in a safe I specifically bought and had installed to keep them safe. I also have a second smaller safe for keeping important documents like passports. 

I own my home and my boyfriend (33m) of 2 years recently moved in as he was renting before. I gave him the code to the smaller safe so he could put valuables in it, but he also wants the code for my gem safe. Not to put anything in it, but he says because we are living together now I should trust him and give him the code. I’ve said no because he has no reason to open the safe as the only thing it’s used for is storing my collection, he’s said he has no interest in my gem collection, doesn’t want to look at them, but still wants the code to access them. 

This is causing tension because he says I should give it to him as a show of trust, and I said no, because he literally has no reason to go in there so he doesn’t need the code. This is a 6 figure collection so I’m not being difficult over a few little gems here. I am the only one who knows the code. 

So Reddit am I being TA here? 

*also we are in the UK so we spell jewellery differently to the US

Edit: holy hell this blew up way more than I ever expected! Im sticking to my guns and I’m not giving him the code. All you lovely internet strangers are right, it’s a huge marinara flag and I’ll be telling him to pack his stuff. I’ll update you later. Thank you all for your comments!!

Edit 2: this keeps coming up, the safe weighs nearly half a ton, it’s bolted to the floor and wall and is from a company who make safes, vaults and strong rooms for jewellers. You could bring the house down around it and it would still be intact.

Final edit: I think I have phrased it badly but all of the gems and jewellery in the safe are mine and mine alone. I do not keep any clients jewellery at home. For my other business doing valuations I rent a separate space and keep client items there. 

I will give an update once things have panned out

Another edit: I’ve checked for cameras (thank you for the suggestions people) and there aren’t any aside from the ones I already have fitted which he doesn’t have access to. I’ve moved all of my personal docs out of the little safe and into my gem safe. I’ve told my colleague what I’m doing and she is going to come around for when I do it. 

Update: 

Firstly thank you so much for the insane amount of comments and support, it meant so much to me.  For all of your messages and questions I’m really sorry if I didn’t get to you there were just so many! 

I probably didn’t emphasise in my last post that we had a couple of conversations about this and me explaining why he had no reason to go in there etc. 

Short version is I told him he isn’t getting the code and I will die on this hill. He has no reason to have it and his continued lack of respect by the pushing of my boundaries wasn’t ok, I felt like he was trying to manipulate me by making it about trust.

After a lot of back and forth he finally admitted that he wanted access to the safe because he didn’t feel like I was sharing the whole house with him, because I insisted on a tenancy agreement rather than just letting him move in, and he didn’t like that part of where he lived was off limits to him. He was also insecure and resented that  I have more money than him and own a home whilst he doesn’t, he had made a few comments about this before but I didn’t realise it was such a big issue for him. He also said that by keeping him out of the safe made him feel like I thought he was lesser than me and that it made him feel like I was treating him like a child. 

I told him if that’s how he feels then this is not the right relationship for either of us and that it was best we break up. He was shocked that I was ending things over this, cried and asked me to reconsider, when I said no he then got angry, called me a stuck up b*tch said he was better off without me anyway and went to his friends. I told him via text he had 30 days before he had to leave (as per the tenancy agreement) so he didn’t need to stay at a friends, he said he would be gone by the end of the week. 2 days later he came back and packed up all of his stuff and left, he’s staying with his friend now. 

I have changed all the locks, I have an alarm and cctv system that’s professionally monitored and I have changed the verbal password I have to give when you call up as a precaution. I’ve checked all of my collection and it hasn’t been touched. I also took your guys advice and am giving my solicitor the code and safe deposit details to be passed to my executor in the event of my death. 

I feel horrible because despite all of this I love him, but lot’s of the comments said how I should have a partner who not only respects my boundaries but takes an interest in my passions and that really got to me because it’s true, so may of you reached out with questions and it made me so happy, but also sad as he never asked me stuff like that, I think this is what pushed me over the edge to end it more than anything. 

I’m pretty cut up right now and missing him, but I know I’ll be ok, I have great friends and family around me, also diamonds are a girls best friend and I have a few knocking around to help cheer me up!",22928,v9tw6c,"NTA.

"AITA for ""forcing"" my husband to sleep on the couch.","


This conflict is pretty recent. I (f29) used to use tampons for my periods but due to medical reasons couldn't do it anymore. now I'm using pads which isn't that big of a deal but my husband disagrees. He firstly complained about me not ""consulting"" him first but like I said it's not a huge deal like BC. He then said he doesn't feel comfortable with me sleeping in bed wearing pads. this threw me off hard because I wasn't expecting him to have an issue on that regard, but he said it just doesn't feel comfortable *for him* and he would like me to use tampons at nighttime or sleep somewhere else. I laughed him off and kept sleeping on the bed while wearing my pads like there was no issue. This made him so uncomfortable he basically took the couch then started complaining about how I forced him on the couch by making him uncomfortable after he already offered me compromises. but I told him he was being a drama queen because his compromises are illogical, I wouldn't stop using pads and free bleed on the bed nor risk my health and use tampons when the doctor advised again them. he's still upset with me even though I'm no longer on my period saying I owe him for making him uncomfortable and brushing off his complaints.",22918,u9vtvq,"‘He firstly complained about me not “consulting” him—‘ Automatic NTA.

AITA for getting my interviewer fired?,"I (f27) went to a job interview for a potential job opportunity at this company. The interviewer, we'll call him ""Eddie"" (30ish) welcomed me into the office and had me sit down. First thing he did was look at my CV then started asking me questions that seemed a little to personal and unrelated to the job. like if I was in a relationship, wether my eye color was ""real"" or just 'lenses"", also asked about how I spend my time when ""alone"" and what type of dudes I like. Like legit personal questions. Don't know if he was testing how I react but I kept it cool til he asked me the question of what my greatest weakness was. I responded by saying ""keeping up with your inappropriate questions and answering them politely!"". He looked at me upset and then told me I had an ""attitude"". it was clear that the interview was over. He told me I didn't get the job which I found unfair because I don't think I desreved to lose the job over what? nothing. I got into an argument with him then told him I was going to report him.

I went to speak to the supervisor and filed a complaint against Eddie. the supervisor apologized to me and tried to reschedule a new interview but I was hasitant about it. Later I was told that Eddie got fired which made me feel guilty. My mom and dad agreed that his questions were inappropriate but said that I went too far by reporting him and having him fired. Eddie tried contacting me via email saying that what I did could've been resolved between us and even said he could've arranged a new interview for me but I ""ruined"" it for myself and cost him his job.

"AITA for giving my son's new bike away after the ""prank"" he pulled on a girl he was friends with?","So recently I found out my son ""Jacob"" (15) pulled an incredibly cruel ""prank"" on one of the girls I'll call ""Ashley"" that's in his friend group. I know this girl, she's been to our house and even attended Jacob's birthday party a month ago. She seemed incredibly sweet if not a bit shy. So when my oldest son ""Mark"" (17) came to me and told me Jacob had asked Ashley out on a date as a prank I was stunned.

I of course asked how he could know this, hoping as any mother would that it wasn't true. But Mark showed me the family tablet we all use (but mostly my sons do) and it seems Jacob forgot to log out of his chatting app, discord. I read the long series of messages between Jacob and his friends as they mocked Ashley all through this heartless prank. I was speechless. And that's not even getting into HOW he was talking, like he was some thug and not a 15 year old living in a gated community.

At first I couldn't figure out what to do, or how to proceed. I'll admit that I never once imagined either of my boys would be the type of person to do something like that. But there was no way in hell I was letting this go. So after a day of thought I decided what was going to happen. First things first, he was grounded, for how long I'm not sure. Secondly, I'd gotten Jacob a bike for his birthday but it hadn't arrived until the day previous and I'd planned to give it to him when my parents came to visit since they'd been unable to make his party.

But instead of that I showed him I knew about the ""prank"" and told him he was grounded, then I made him carry the new bike out of my bedroom closet and to the car before driving to Ashley's house, him crying the whole way. I'd called her parents earlier and explained everything and so once we got there I had him cart it to their front porch and ring the bell. Then in front of me, Ashley, her parents, and God I had him give a sincere apology and gift her the bike. Even I apologized to her, saying I didn't raise my boy this way and what he did was unforgivable. I also called the parents of the other boys who were apart of this little stunt and they all seemed rightfully horrified by their sons' involvement.

I felt I'd handled this all as best as I could, and my friends agreed. Though once my parents found out that I'd made Jacob give his birthday gift away they said what I did went too far. I still feel like what I did was right but having my parents more or less dog pile on me like this actually made me wonder if how I handled it was too extreme? AITA here?",22872,su4efr,As someone who has been ‘pranked’ like this it’s very refreshing to see you stand up for her and not just excuse away what your son did.

AITA for not wanting my husband to go to his ex's funeral?,"I'll admit I'm biased right off the bat. I couldn't stand her.

I call her ""his ex"" to myself and others. He called her ""his friend"".

We're all in our early 40s. She died recently - aneurysm. 

I've been with him 10 years now, but he'd known her for 20+.

The way he tells it: They were friends in college, decided to date, got married, then realized they weren't a great couple and decided to just be friends. All that happened years before I met him. He was clear early on that she was ""important"". 

A couple months into dating, it came up that his *friend* was actually his *ex-wife*. He explained the above to me, saying she was one of his closest friends and that it was purely platonic. I expressed some discomfort at him being so close to an ex, and he told me ""That's fine. If you have a serious issue with it, let me know now and save us some time. I'll choose her. I like you and all, but I've known her for over 12 years and she's one of the most important people in my life. You'll have to be ok with that if you want us to be a thing."" 

When we were engaged I asked again. He gave me this perplexed look & asked ""Why would us getting married affect my friendships?""

I sucked it up & went along. I resented every moment of knowing her, especially when we had to be social. She understood some part of him I couldn't. Her husband was friends with mine as well, so it's not like I could use him as an angle.

He'd have lunch with the ex, they'd go to their geeky movies, and whatever. 

The few times I brought it up he said ""We had this conversation before. You had your chance to back out.""

She died after they had lunch the other day on the way to her car. He spent a bunch of time crying, but honestly I was relieved.

He was working with her husband on funeral planning. I told him ""You don't think you're going, do you?""

My argument, summed up: She's dead, so she's not a factor anymore. He doesn't get to use his ""she's my friend"" excuse since she doesn't exist anymore. He had his cry for a couple days, he gets to be done with mourning her already. There's no need for him to go to her funeral, since I wouldn't want her at his.

He was the angriest I've ever seen him when I told him that, replying that he'll be going no matter how I feel, and that he's ""willing to burn this to the fucking ground"" while holding up his wedding band. ""Besides you, she was the closest friend in my life.""

Him, her husband & my sisters are calling me an insensitive asshole over this, all saying that there was no romantic aspect to their relationship, & that I'm heartless. Her husband went so far as calling me a ""ghoul"" for how I've reacted.

I never felt their relationship was appropriate, and I hid that for years because I wanted to be  with my husband. Now that she's gone, I don't feel I should have to hide it anymore, and can speak freely. 

AITA for just wanting him to be *done* with her, and for him to not attend the funeral?",22880,zpz8tc,">She died after they had lunch the other day on the way to her car. He spent a bunch of time crying, but honestly I was relieved.

AITA for not moving back home with my parents?,"My (18M) parents planned on being a child free couple, but because of religious beliefs they kept me even if I was an unwanted pregnancy.

I don't remember when exactly I was told, but I always knew that I would be expected to move out as soon as I reached 18 years old. I have been working and saving since I turned 13 and have a respectable ammount in a savings account.

Now to be fair to my parents, they provided for me financially, they were distant emotionally but they have never been abusive.

A week before my 18th birthday (January 13th) they sat me down and asked if I have found a place to move into yet. I said yes and that was the extent of the conversation.

I was planning to live in an apartment with 4 other guys, but a friend's family heard about it and offered me their finished basement with separate access for a very cheap price ($150 a month utilities included, no down payment required). So I jumped at the opportunity even though I know it is a pity offer. It is relevant that both his family and mine are of Indian descent.

I moved out the day after my birthday and my parents haven't contacted me since. I admit that I did not reach out to them too.

Yesterday my dad called to invite me to dinner. It was awkward even before they asked me to move back in, said I don't have to pay them rent or anything. But here's the thing, I like my new living situation, it lacks the awkwardness and tension that I didn't even know was there untill I moved out.

When I said no, politely at that and thanking them for the offer, my mother started crying and left the room, while my dad started scolding me and saying that their friends are excluding them because of the ""rumour"" that they threw me out and another desi family had to take me in.

I said that that was exactly what happened, and it isn't my job to save them from the consequences of their actions and decisions.

Now my whole extended family is calling me nonstop and saying I am being an AH.

So AITA?

Edit: first I want to thank you all for the kind comments and well wishes, I was hesitating for a moment there and you all made me feel so much better about my decision. I read every comment and appreciate every award. Didn't think this post would explode like this but I am happy because of all the nice comments.

To answer a question that was asked by a lot of my fellow desi Redditors: I think my parents thought that I would be moving with strangers and they could say that I was trying to be independent and they were supportive of that. But when I moved with people from the community they couldn't pretend anymore.

Also I think the aunty and uncle I live with are the ones who told people about the situation, they are extremely nice and were very upset about what my parents did. They have offered me to live with them as long as I wish and were not even going to accept any rent except I insisted.",22829,scxsv8,"“ saying that their friends are excluding them because of the ""rumour"" that they threw me out and another desi family had to take me in.”

UPDATE: AITA for telling everyone to leave me the fuck alone?,"Wow. I have never felt so supported and loved in a very long time. I wasn’t even going to post anything but I’m so happy I did. 

I don’t know how to explain just how big of an impact everyone’s comments and dms had on me. It was so lovely. Thank you so much for all the offers of friendship, and more. 

So as of a few weeks ago, I moved in with my father. Being alone with my son had me going crazy. The loneliness was literally killing me. I needed help and I am no longer ashamed to admit it. My dad made the offer.

I work Mon-Fri and have the weekends off and well I’ve been following everyone’s advice and signed up for a mommy and me thing nearby. It was nerve wrecking but so many moms were so friendly and came up to me themselves. I got three numbers and they’re all inviting me to a dinner party. They’re really sweet despite being at least 5 years older than me. They’ve sort of adopted me lol (their words not mine).

I’m also going for walks after work. My dad and son come along sometimes. Me and my dad also cook together and we make some pretty neat stuff for his girlfriend who has also been really kind. 

As for my mother and sisters, I still don’t know why they dislike me and my baby so much. But I took that step and left the GC. This might sound ridiculous but it was really hard. I even shed a tear. But I did it. They haven’t spoken to me since.

I contacted my in laws one last time. Idk why but his parents said they were willing to meet. They won’t try and take him from me but my dad got me a lawyer just in case. I’m meeting them this weekend and depending on how it goes, I will let them see my son eventually. 

Finally, I saw a doctor and I’ve been diagnosed with PPD. I’m currently seeing a therapist that was recommended to me and have started a treatment plan. My son, father and his gf have been my biggest supporters and I‘m trying to be better for me but them as well. I’ve also been missing my fiancé a lot these days but his memory is kind of calming. Idk.

It hasn’t been very long but I’m already seeing improvements in my life. It’s crazy how making my original post kickstarted this change. Thank you so very much for everything.

Edit:

Thank you so so so much for all the nice comments and messages. I’m trying to read them all but there’s too many and I cannot keep up haha. I’ve shed a few tears as well.

The meeting with my in laws went well and my fiancé’s mother cried a lot and said she was so sorry. I didn’t give too many details but I did show them pictures of my son. They still won’t be meeting him till a lot later and without me but it’s progress. Also I call my fiancé my bf and fiancé because well he passed away a week before proposing to me. I found the ring and his friends told me. So although he was never “officially” my fiancé, it’s just comforting. And I call my in laws my in laws because it helps with the word count. 

But yeah, thanks again :)",22769,v3cc3q,I’m a happy to hear that your previous post helped you to reach such a positive outcome. Keep pushing forward OP.

AITA for refusing to answer to a nickname I don’t like?,"Throwaway account and fake names. I don’t think I’m TAH here but one of my coworkers does and we both follow this reddit, so we’re letting reddit decide. 

I (28F) was named after a really obscure character from Greek Mythology. My preferred nickname is taken from the end of my name. I always introduce myself with “I’m (my name) but you can call me (nickname).” None of my coworkers in the small business we work for have ever had a problem with this before, until Megan(25F), the niece of Jeff(50sM) one of the two owners, was hired. Jeff and Dave(50sM) co-own the business but Dave does the actual day to day running of the business. I introduced myself and my nickname as usual but she immediately said that “Bessie” (not the actual name) would be a better nickname because it comes from the beginning of my name and that she liked it better. I told her I really didn’t like that nickname and wouldn’t answer to it and asked her to please not call me Bessie but she insisted that it was so much prettier and that I just needed to get used to it.

For the next two months she tried to call me Bessie but I completely ignored her whenever she addressed me that way, even when I knew she really needed help with something. She would call my desk phone and say “hey Bessie” I would reply “you have the wrong number there’s no Bessie here” and hang up. She then tried to get some of the employees outside the office to start calling me Bessie, but I quickly shut that down. I usually finish my work early and help them with a lot of tedious little things that aren’t part of my job description and threaten to stop helping them unless they used my preferred nickname.

Friday she decided she was going to get me to respond to Bessie no matter what. We have an open office design but are at opposite ends. She started calling out Bessie in a singsong voice over and over again to try and annoy me enough to respond. Other coworkers got annoyed, most telling her to stop and one Lisa(43F) telling me to just let her call me Bessie already. I refused and she kept calling out Bessie louder and louder, until Dave barged in. He’d been on a conference call with an important client and could hear her yelling from his office down the hall. He told her to be quiet and that if she called me Bessie one more time, he’d write her up and dock her pay. 

Later, Megan cornered me in the break room, called me an AH for getting her in trouble and called me Bessie again for good measure just as Dave was walking in to heat up his lunch. He gave her a stern look and said “I warned you.” Then he walked to HR to have her written up. Lisa is saying I’m the AH for never helping Megan and that, if I had been nicer or hadn’t fought her so hard on the nickname, she probably would have given up on it a while ago but because I made such a big deal out of it, it became a challenge. So reddit, AITA?",22769,t28sn2,"Lisa thinks you should just give in and let the bully win?

How kind of her to side with a bully!

AITA? For refusing to let MIL spend the night in my bedroom and lock the door?,"

Context: my husband (m34) and I (f26) got married 9 months ago, we live in a different town from his parents, and his mom visited us unexpectedly on friday. 

Now to give some context about my MIL, She is okay-ish but has no respect for her son's privacy and by extension, mine. 

When it was time to go to bed, MIL requested that we let her sleep in the bedroom, on the master bed, not just that but lock the door as well because she explained she can't feel comfortable enough to sleep without locking the door. I found this bizzare but I politely declined and suggeted other options like the guest room, couch and air mattress but no she turned around and presented these options to me. My husband agreed but I said no. This initiated an argument between her and I. During the argument I pointed put how I didn't want to be keot out of my room and away from my stuff but she lashed out at my husband saying ""Don't you just stand there! Say something!"". My husband told me to let her it's just one night, but I told her those were all the options I had for her and if she didn't like them then I could book her in a hotel. She took it as in I was kicking her out and started crying which made my husband upset. 

She left at 12am and my husband blew up saying I disrespected his mom who was a GUEST at our house and treated her poorly, he then reminded me it's our bedroom not just mine and I acted horribly to her causing her to go stay at a hotel in the middle of the night. He went to book a room in the same hotel as her and turned his phone off. The next day she went home and told the family who berated me calling my behavior towards MIL abhorrent and loathsome, now my husband is complaining about how I keep trying to ruin his relationship with his family and push them away. 

But I want to know if I was really ta?",22767,t9f229,"NTA.

AITA for demanding my son take his daughter on his family trip to Disneyland?,"I got pregnant with my son Julius (28) about a month after my 18th birthday. I tried to do my best for him and he got into a good engineering school but at 19, he got his then girlfriend Iza pregnant and they had Annabella together. I've been the one who has mostly raised her (Iza got deported but they spend July together and FT every night). Julius got married to his girlfriend Katja after graduation and they have two wonderful boys together. Annabella lives with me and not with them.

The thing is, Julius never spends any time with Annabella. He doesn't even call to say goodnight. But she loves him so much. It's like once a month, he'll show up with a box full of toys, spend a day with her and then go back to his family. It hurts her so much that he doesn't spend time with her because he's her hero. I'm just grandma. And no, he doesn't act this way because of his wife. Katja would love to have Annabella move in with them, she once brought up the idea and she went on about all the things they could do together. She would love to be her stepmom, calls her princess, sweetie and so many nice nicknames. The only reason they haven't is because Julius has said she should stay with me.

A few days ago, Julius told me that he and Katja were planning a trip to Disneyland in August. I told him that Annabella would be so excited and he should tell her on her birthday and he just blankly told me she's not coming and the trip is for his boys. I made it clear to him that he needed to bring her on the trip and he just called me an asshole - which he's never done before - for trying to control him.

AITA for telling my son i’d rather have his ex wife as a daughter than him as my son after he got cut out of the will?,"16 years ago my son Matthew had a daughter with his now ex wife Josie. I have always thought of Josie as my own daughter, so when they divorced 7 years ago due to my son cheating, I was conflicted and disappointed. Josie wasn’t particularly close with any of her family, so My husband and I naturally took them in. Josie was an angel, she had insisted that we didn’t have to lift a finger more than before we had taken them in and though she was hurt, she kept civil around Matthew.

My husband and I held a huge hand in raising their daughter Ruth, because Matthew remarried less than a year later and now has a four year old son after disowning Ruth. Two years ago my husband was diagnosed with lung cancer, it was hard on everyone, especially Ruth. They were extremely close, she told him about her girlfriends and boyfriends before anyone else and has always wanted him to be the one to walk her down the isle at her wedding. Matt rarely ever visited and didn’t answer our calls often saying that we had other kids so it wasn’t like my husband was dying lonely.

Last night Matt stopped by to talk about inheritance, he never mentioned Josie nor Ruth and hinted that he thought he should get more inheritance than his siblings the entire time. My husband and I shared awkward looks until he decided to cut in, he explained that everyone would get a piece, but he’d focus more on Ruth and Bonnie (one of our other grandkids). Matt got angry and said that Ruth was just a bastard and that his son deserved more than her, my husband got furious after that and left the room saying that he wouldn’t include Matthew at all. 

Matt yelled back and turned to me saying that Ruth wasn’t worth it because she’d just grow up to be a whore like her mother, I told him that i’d rather have her mother as my daughter than him as my son and insisted that he leave. I’m getting phone calls from Matt’s wife and family friends saying that my husband and I overreacted and he was just angry that we were playing favorites.

AITA?

EDIT: To clear some things up: Josie did not cheat on Matthew, Josie and Matthew met later in college and Josie was known as a “party girl” before that, Ruth isn’t the product of an affair but we are planning on getting a DNA test because what Matthew said has gotten under Ruth’s skin (she was at the house when this occurred and over heard it)

When it came to taking in Josie and Ruth we didn’t hesitate because Josie is not from here, she and Matt lived in another country until he moved them here a few months before he got caught cheating and they had no where else to go as Josie was a stay at home mom. i had no intentions of “choosing” Josie over Matt, then and now, and I never discouraged Matt from visiting, i tried to make it very clear that we weren’t picking and choosing when we took Josie in, we just wanted her and our granddaughter to be safe and have a good home.",22732,s8uw0w,"NTA.

AITA for yelling at my boyfriend for making me leave my best friend's wedding?,"

My boyfriend, 27, and I, 26 have been together for 2 years. He's a good heart and is normally rational but his one issue is that he expects to accompany me in every ocassion nomatter how big or small. He even went with me to my ex boyfriend's funeral after days of begging. 

Now my best friend got married few days ago, it was very small and only close family and friends were invited, My boyfriend couldn't come because of the + one rule. He pitched a hissy fit saying my best friend has no respect for my relationship and was shocked when he learned that I was still going to attend, He told me that if he can't go then I'm expected to not go as well but that is my best friend and I had to respect her rules. He gave me an altimatum either we go together or I stay home with him. I ended up going cause again I respected my friend's rules. He was angry with me and kept calling the entire 2hr drive then stopped. Later I got a text from his friend telling me he (my boyfriend) got into an accident and was taken to the hospital. I freaked out he gave me the address and I had to leave the wedding and told my friends why. 

I was a crying the entire drive home and kept calling his friend but got no response. I arrived to the hospital and asked about my boyfriend and they checked and told me he wasn't there, My anxiety reached 160% as I kept calling his friends one by one. I just went home and there he was...along with his friend. He saw me and said that he was sorry but this was the only he can get me home after I left him alone. After the initial shock I just blew up yelling at him about lying and making me leave my friend's wedding and having me literally go to the hospital and freaking out cause of him. I kicked his friend out and we got into an argument. He kept talking about how much I love him thus I left which is my own doing not his and he was just trying to see if I really chose my friend's wedding over him. He then argued that my friend caused this and I shouldn't agree with her to exclude him, I said what he did was horrible and called him horrible and then went to my room. It was awful cause my friends kept calling to check in on him cause they thought he was really at the hospital. He said I overreacted and that I yelled at the wrong person.

"AITA for telling my wife she was ""so close"" to getting her dream job?","I'm a 33-year-old man and my wife is 27.

Since the start of our relationship, my wife has been very particular about how things get done, and tends to believe that she knows the one true correct way for anything related to anything. She has admitted that she can be a control freak. While this bothers me, it has never been a true dealbreaker in our relationship.

Very often when I do just about anything, whether it be a household chore, assembling a piece of furniture, taking a picture, or writing a presentation for work (in a field where I have a master's degree and she has no formal education), she'll do this thing where she'll condescendingly say ""You were *so close* to getting it right,"" really drawing out the ""so close"" part. I've told her dozens of times that I'd prefer for her to stop because it sounds so condescending, but she insists that she's complimenting me.

I do the dishes and place them out to dry in an orientation she doesn't approve of?

>You were *so close*. Next time, put them that way.

I take a picture of her?

>You were *so close*. Next time, angle the camera this way.

I complete a project at work and show her the results?

>You were *so close*. Next time, write it this way.

For the last two months my wife has been undergoing an intensive hiring process for a job in our city. She works in a highly niche field and seldom finds job openings, and therefore she was ecstatic to have the opportunity for a relatively well-paying job doing what she wants to do. She got to the very final stage where the company was considering two people, coincidentally the other of whom was her college roommate. Well, on Friday she got ""the call"" telling her thanks for her application but blah blah blah, record on file, all that jazz.

My wife came to me crying. I immediately comforted her and ""You were *so close*"" blurted out. Her head whipped up and she asked what I meant by that. I said she was *so close* to getting the job, but was just a bit off. She immediately walked out to stay at her friend's house, where she is currently sulking. She finally sent me a text this afternoon calling me a huge jerk. 

Was I unnecessarily being an asshole here?",22679,y60dq7,"NTA

You just confirmed that every time she’s thrown that line at you, it was never meant as a compliment. She got a taste of her crappy medicine and didn’t like it.

AITA for saying no to picking up my sons half sister from school?,"I am a single mom of two boys ages 11 and 10. Their father and I divorced 5 years ago after I learned he was cheating on me. He got her pregnant either right before he told me, and that was why he confessed, or right after. But our divorce was not an easy one. He wanted to stay ""friends"" and I could not look at him after what he did. He and I were together for over 13 years, he was also a friend before he was my boyfriend/husband and to have him betray me like that and treat me as he had was awful.

He married his affair partner. They had a daughter within months of our separation, followed by a son after the divorce/their marriage. Last year they lost a baby which led to the discovery that his wife had cancer.

What followed was a lot of fighting between the two of us again. He wanted me to help him and his wife out. He said their children (who are currently 5 and 3) needed family beyond just him and his wife. His own family disowned him for our divorce (they were extremely religious) and she has no family. I told him it would be over my dead body I would help him. He argued that it was for the children and if not for his kids with her, then for our boys, who could see their family heal and be one. I told him he stopped any chance of that happening when he cheated on me.

What I did not expect was for him to tell his daughter's school to call me when she got sick. He was at work at the time and couldn't leave apparently because he had already missed a lot of work due to his wife, and she was home recovering from chemo. I got the call, was asked if I would pick her up and I said no. Several hours later I got reamed on the phone by him for leaving his sick child at school when I knew they had nobody. This is when he told me how he couldn't leave and how his wife was resting. I told him the babysitter for his son should have been called over me. He told me he was in daycare and I should be fucking ashamed because she was a sick child who is going through a lot and I could have helped. He told me he hoped our son's were going to be fucking ashamed of me. They aren't. And I argued back with him over the phone at the time.

But I guess part of me does feel bad for the child. My son's also sensed an atmosphere while they were with their dad after the incident when they talked about me, and I hate that for them.

AITA for telling my estranged sister and our parents that she and her kids are not my problem?,"7 years ago I was married and expecting a baby when things went horribly wrong. Around 10 weeks into my pregnancy I suffered a miscarriage and then I returned home to find my husband in bed with my sister. The two of them tried to apologize and convince me that we could all get over it. But I wanted nothing to do with either of them and even less so when I found out she had gotten pregnant. My divorce was finalized quickly because I wanted nothing from him other than the divorce and was willing to leave the marriage with nothing but the clothes on my back. 

Pretty early I realized my parents were hoping I would want to still be part of the baby's life but I wanted nothing to do with the baby my sister conceived while sleeping with my husband (now ex) as I lay in hospital losing my own pregnancy. I refused any and all contact with my sister and ex. They married and had two more children after the one she concieved during my marriage to him.

I met my current husband when I had distanced myself from my whole family and he was amazing and his family were great. We got married two years ago and his family are nothing short of the best. I adore the nieces and nephews I have gained through my marriage to him and we spend a lot of time together.

Around three months ago my sister called me at work (using my work phone) and told me she needed me and could I please come to her. I hung up the phone and continued about my day. It was several hours later that I got a message from my parents saying I needed to be with my sister. A few days later I got another call and was told my sister had been pregnant, the baby passed away inside of her and she delivered a stillborn all while he was out sleeping with someone else. My parents and sister expected me to rally around her and I didn't. Now that some time has passed and she lives with them, I have been inundated with them saying I should meet her kids, be there for them like I am my husband's nieces and nephews and that I should reconcile with the family. My sister told me how sorry she was again and that she wanted us to make up. I told the three of them that she and her kids are not my problem and I still want nothing to do with them.

AITA for leaving in the middle of celebration because of the toast my husband gave?,"

I f25 married my husband m31 3 years ago. I'm currently pregnant with our first baby together. We found out it's a girl and my inlaws wanted to invite us for dinner for ""gender reveal announcement and celebration"".

We got there, saw many relatives coming to congrat us and celebrate. It was bigger than expected which made me nervous because I'm not a fan of being around many people.


We sat at dinner table and I barely ate, I was feeling so much anxiety and was sort of upset my husband didn't warn me about how many people were coming, but I tried to stay calm and collected. Anyways, after the announcement and in the middle of the celebration my husband wanted to give a toast. He opened a bottle and poured a drink and wished that our daughter be ""healthy, happy, but look nothing like me"". Everyone at the table laughed. I sat there staring in shock while he kept laughing with them. I felt so much rage and my anxiety got out of hand ngl. I got up, took my purse and made my way out. His mom followed me asking if I was okay,  I told her I just wanted tk go home. He came to the door asking what was wrong that's when we started arguing. He said this was a ""joke toast"" and that my reaction was over the top, but the thing is eversince i got pregnant he kept hinting he doesn't want our daughter to look like me. He even once got up in the morning and first thing he told me was how much he wished our daughter look nothing like me. It hurt me while I'm already dealing with low self esteem and anxiety. I wanted to go home but he said I was being a baby and that I should learn to take a ""fucking"" joke. I said he made everyone laugh at me buy he defensively said it didn't warrant me to walk out of dinner and be so disrespectful to the re,ative who came to celebrate and share our joy.

I went home and he called many times telling me to get my ""insecurities"" in check before j pass them up to our daughter, he urged me to get therapy and stop acting so dramatically like how I did infront of his family.

I think leaving dinner wasn't thf best solution but I just got overwhelmed.",22637,ut2rhl,"Oh hang on … I thought you meant he didn’t want the baby to look like himself!  He actually said he didn’t want the baby to look like you?

He knew that wasn’t a joke.  All of the people listening would have known it wasn’t a joke.

Any idea why he was being cruel?  If he really doesn’t like your looks, then why did he tie you down from finding someone who *will* appreciate you?

It’s common that physical and/or emotional abuse starts at pregnancy.  Beware.

Make yourself an escape plan.  Start now.

AITA for prioritizing my son's dog over my wife's pregnancy?,"When my son (14) was eight, we got a dog. He's half Great Dane and half some dog my friend's dog met during an unauthorized absence. My son loves this dog and does all the care for him (except vet stuff) and is a very responsible dog owner. This dog is pretty much his best friend.

My wife is 12 weeks pregnant, and ever since we confirmed the pregnancy she has been acting weird around the dog. She avoids him, puts her hands over her stomach when he is around and jolts whenever he makes noise. Today she told me she wants to re-home the dog. I asked her what she was talking about.

She said she has been having anxiety that he will jump on her. This is completely unreasonable. He doesn't jump on people. We trained him not to jump on people or run into people very young because he is half Great Dane and I felt this was important for all dogs, but especially one who could possibly grow to such a large size (which he did). There is no reason for her to think the dog will jump on her.

She said that there is no way to know for sure that the dog won't jump on her, and if he does our baby could be hurt. This dog has never so much as growled at her. She said even if the dog doesn't jump on her, her anxiety about it is bad for her health. She said she needs the dog elsewhere for her safety and the baby's.

I told her that there was no way. My son got this dog right after he lost his mom and imprinted on him hard. Sometimes I think he loves the dog more than me! I'm not taking his dog. The dog didn't do anything!

My wife said I am prioritizing the dog over her pregnancy. The dog isn't a threat to her pregnancy. If this were any other unreasonable request, I would just do it because she is pregnant. I just can't break my son's heart over a fear she has that makes no sense. Am I being an asshole?",22637,104hya7,"NTA. Don’t you dare give away you son’s dog.

AITA for bluntly telling a woman it’s dangerous to put essential oils in sensitive areas?,"My uncle’s new girlfriend came to family dinner the other night and it was the first time anyone in my family met her. She is super into essential oils which is very eyeroll inducing for me but I didn’t say anything about it or show that I found it annoying at first. I bit my tongue while she went on about putting them in her water (you should not be ingesting essential oils) and rubbing them on pressure points and trying to convince my mom to buy some. 

But then she brought up that they can be super good for yeast infections!!? I looked at her super horrified and asked “you mean you’re putting them *down there*??” And she said yes you just insert a few drops and it clears up right away! I told her this was very dangerous and could cause chemical burns as well as throwing off your vaginal ph and potentially causing other infections. She said “oh no you don’t have to worry about that they’re all natural!!” To which I replied “so is poison ivy but I wouldn’t suggest shoving it up your vagina.” She just looked kind of shocked. My sister laughed and my aunt said “well she has a point,” but other family members said that it was rude and crass.

AITA for laughing hysterically after a date kept insisting to me that women have periods from their butts?,"Throwaway. There was this guy(22M) who I(20F) have gone on a few dates with in the past couple of months. He's nice and so far we've only progressed to going on public dates, but about a week ago we finally decided to have a nice date at my place. Since it was going to be at my place I let him know before that I was on my period because I wasn't sure what expectations he had or where his boundaries were yet, and we agreed to just have a nice takeout dinner and watch a movie.

He comes over and we eat then sit down on the couch to pick a movie when he says that it sucked that I was on my period Then he said how he thought it was so strange that women give birth through the vagina but have periods from their butts. (This was a completely unpromoted statement from him and I'm still not sure how we got on the topic tbh) I asked him what he meant by that and he said again exactly what he had said before. I kind of smiled, assuming he was very much just joking, and said ""oh yeah, so weird"" thinking that he was going to start laughing soon to end the joke. He didn't, and instead started to talk about his first and only girlfriend he'd had in high school and how she used to complain about bad ""period poops"" all the time. At this point I ask him if he is being serious and he looks a little confused and says he is.

I ask him to explain how he came to that conclusion and he explained that his first experience being around periods was the hs gf and before then he had never received or seen much information. He understood it was something that happened inside the body and that blood came out ""somewhere"" but assumed it came out of the vagina until he heard her complaining and realized it actually came out of the butt. It was very unexpected coming from a 22 year old man. I somehow managed to keep my composure when I told him that periods do in fact come out of the vagina and not butts.

He looked confused and then a little frustrated and started insisting to me that was wrong and then kept saying ""are you sure?"" as if I was confused about where it came out of my own body. I explained to him the anatomy a bit and how it worked but he was very adamant. Eventually he conceded that most women must have periods like that, but some, hence his ex-gf, have their periods form their butts. He just could not understand no matter how many times I tried to explain it to him that he had just simply come to the wrong conclusion and misinterpreted his gf's words. The whole situation became so much that I started to laugh. I was doubled over, clutching my stomach, crying laughing over this whole debacle, and he sat there red-faced, continuing to try and argue with me. Eventually he said he was ready to leave and did before we could watch a movie. I felt bad for laughing after he left because I could tell that had been when he decided to leave and he also texted me later that night to say he had done a little bit of research ""on his own"" and that he was no longer interested in pursuing any sort of relationship because he couldn't stand to be with someone who laughed at someone for ""not understanding"".

AITA for my response to my brother in law's comment about my leg hair?,"

So, my f19, sister, f28 and brother in law came over with the kids for dinner at my parents house. 

I was watching my nieces while dinner was getting ready, we sat down and I happened to sit next to brother in law. I was wearing a skirt and it was accidentally lifted above my knee, my brother in law looked down at my leg and made face then loudly said ""Oh shooo, Op! This is gross, you should've shaved, that hair isn't supposed to be there"". Everyone stared, I told him ""if it's not supposed to be there then why does it grow there, can you explain?"" He was like ""it's just not supposed to be there"", I point at his mustache and say ""well, guess the same thing can be said about your little mustache then, huh?"". He looks at meeyes wide open, and awkward silence takes over though some laughed. My sister told me to knock it off as my brother in law got up from his chair and went inside the bathroom. My sister followed and I could hear him having a breakdown asking her if there was something wrong with his mustache, my brother and I kept giggling but dinner got cut short cause my brother in law wanted to leave. 

I later got scolded by my sister saying I stepped over the line and disrespected someone who's older than me, who's herhusband and demanded I apologize to him for insulting him and ruining dinner.


AITA?

Edit - Guys! My sister said the reason my brother in law got so offended was because he considers his mustache as a symbol of his ""manhood"" and so I insulted his ""manhood"" not just made a ""backhanded comment"".

AITA for telling my wife it was a mistake to stay at a baby shower?,"So my wife (26F) and I (28M) have been married for a year and began trying to conceive in September. No luck so far but the doctor did say at our first appointment that it typically takes close to a year for most couples to conceive. She’s been telling people that she’s infertile (which isn’t true, doctor said she isn’t). 

My wife and I went to my work Christmas party in mid December, where my wife met my coworkers wife (let’s call her Mary) and they took a liking to each other. Mary was pregnant and invited my wife to her baby shower (which was yesterday), and my wife sounded excited to go. I asked her when we were alone if she thinks she’ll be fine. I know my wife and I know what typically bothers her. I knew she wouldn’t bask in happiness over someone else’s pregnancy so I urged her to think it through. She said she’s fine and she was excited so she went.

The baby shower was yesterday. About 40 minutes in, she calls me and asks me to come. I was at a cafe nearby because I knew she wouldn’t stay long. I find her at the entrance of the house crying and a BUNCH of women consoling her. When she saw me she came to me and pulled me to the garden to talk. She said she was dancing and looked at Mary’s pregnant belly and couldn’t take it anymore, started crying and ran out. All of Mary’s friends followed her out to console her. I consoled her myself, and said “ok let’s go babe. Where do you want to go? We can go for a drive so you can feel better”, she looked at me weird and asked why she would leave. I asked why she would stay. She said she feels better now and can go have a good time. I sighed and said “babe, you know that’s not going to happen. And I doubt the attention will be on Mary after this and that’s not great. It’s her baby shower and she deserves to be celebrated. I can’t see how people are going to shift their focus from consoling you to celebrating her if you’re still there”. She rolled her eyes at me and said she was going back in and that I could leave.

3 hours later, the party was nearing its end so I go back to pick her up. My coworker and I stepped into the house and lo and behold, everyone is sitting in a circle with my wife being the centre of attention. Coworker looked for his wife and she wasn’t there at all. He called her and she said she had left ages ago. 

My wife and I entered the car and I first asked her how she was feeling and we spoke about it for a few minutes. I then asked her what happened and why Mary left. She said “oh crap, Mary. I forgot to say bye to her”. I told her Mary left ages ago. I then said “I know you’re going through a hard time but why on earth would you and her friends do this? If they consoled you for a few minutes that’s fine but the entire party? We really should’ve left earlier”. She looked at me so offended and said “are you Mary’s husband or mine?”. We stared at each other for a while and just drove home in silence. I told her I want to talk to her this morning to sort things out but she ignored me and left the house.",22574,10cm7if,"NTA

AITA for leaving a bad review on a small store,"So my boyfriend and I have a tradition for our anniversary that we each go to a store and separate, and after we buy each other gifts we exchange in the car. It’s silly and cute.

We walked into this new mom & pop anime store (I am a huge anime nerd and my boyfriend likes video games which they also sell)


We separate and I go look at stuff for my boyfriend. A worker walks up to me and starts chatting, then points at my leg. I have a pretty big tattoo of Kakashi from Naruto on my thigh, among other anime tattoos. 

He asks if I got that for my boyfriend and I said no, I’ve always loved Naruto and then showed him my other tattoos which included the leaf village symbol, Gaara of the sands gourd, and a piece on my arm of Asuma Sarutobi.

He started quizzing me on the lore of the anime and I told him I wouldn’t have spent $1000 on tattoos of an anime I didn’t know about, and I didn’t appreciate him trying to catch me in a “Gotcha” moment. 


He told me he didn’t believe a girl could ever fully understand the real story of Naruto and the depth behind it (lol) 


I told him I didn’t need his services and he can go back to the front desk. He told me I was a “rude wannabe bitch” and walked into the back and I continued purchasing my items. 

I left a review later, TLDR: if you’re feminine presenting enter with caution, one of the employees will call you a bitch when you don’t want to prove your “nerd cred” to him. 


The owner left a comment on my review asking for an email conversation and asked that I take down my review because people have started complaining about this employee as well and his sale revenue has dropped. 


I told him I wouldn’t and maybe he shouldn’t hire misogynists if he doesn’t want bad reviews. My friends tell me I’m over reacting.

AITA for telling my SIL that I will call the cops for child abandonment the moment she steps out of the house?,"Me(25M), my brother Jack(27M) and his wife Jill(25F).

It all started when Jack and Jill got pregnant. Their lease almost ended and my parents invited them to stay at our house.
The day they came, Jack asked me why I haven't moved out of my room yet. I was confused, like wtf, and he told me that he and Jill will be at my room and I go to guest room. I refused, but my parents got mad, we got into a fight, I lost and ended in much smaller guest room.

Then Jill had a problem with my cooking. I eat scrambled eggs with mozzarela and avocado every day for breakfast and she couldn't stand the smell. She asked me to stop, I refused, my parents got involved, I had to stop. There were problems with other food too, and I had to stop cooking them. I was told I must be more accomodating cause she pregnant. Like that is my problem.
Then Jill started to boss me around. We were alone for 8 hours while my parents and Jack worked. She obviously tought I will be her personal maid. I refused, she trew a temper tantrum, like always, and I again
had big fight with Jack and my parents. I was told that she had a high risk pregnancy and was on bed rest, and I'm an asshole for not helping her. I told Jack that he knocked her up, it's his responsibility. I stood my ground and in the end Jill's cousin came to help her sometimes.

Than Jill gave birth to my nephew. I congratulated them when they came home, and that is it. I don't like babies, so I mostly keep for myself now. But that doesn't stop Jill to ask for favors. Please watch the baby while a take quick shower, please watch it while I make myself some food, etc.. I always refuse and we all have new fights over and over again.
It all came to head last Friday when she asked me to watch my nephew while she goes to pharmacy for baby formula. I refused. She got mad and we had a fight. She grabed her purse to go anyway and I told her, that the moment she walks out that door I will call the police for child abandonment. I was serious and she knew it. She broke down and screamed what a horrible human being I am, then she ran to her room. She had complete mental breakdown.

When Jack and my parents came home we had the biggest fight yet. Jack accused me of hating Jill and my nephew, upon other things. I told him I refuse to bond because they will weaponize him against me. My parents told me enough is enough. That they can't believe they raised such a selfish human being. And that either I help or I move out. I'm thinking of second option.
AITA?

AITA for refusing to let my daughter do an after school detention and threatening to pick her up?,"My daughter Amanda (F13) has Cerebral Palsy. She is able to walk independently but cannot walk for long periods of time and cannot walk on anything other than even ground without assistance (i.e stairs have to have rails, can't walk on rocks/sand/etc). She has an IEP for this - that states what she can and cannot do in PE, excursions, etc. It's relevant to note that Amanda catches the bus home - but can only catch a specific route as the other route the school offers drops her off at a road about a mile away that has no footpath.

I got a call at work at 11am today telling me that Amanda had spoken quite rudely to a substitute PE (gym) teacher who tried to make her climb the rock wall that her school has. Apparently Amanda did say ""I can't, I have Cerebral Palsy and I have an IEP"" but when another child said ""Yeah! Same here!"" the teacher didn't believe her and became insistent - standing over her so Amanda told him to ""fuck off"" and wouldn't repeat anything but ""fuck off"" until she was sent to the office.

It is in the handbook that this type of offence is a same day after school detention. But when the Principal called me I said ""absolutely not"". I told them that they were welcome to do a weeks worth of lunch detentions, or even schedule it so that I can change my work schedule - but absolutely not this afternoon. My husband is away for work, I have to work until 6pm and I need Amanda to be on her regular bus because I have nobody who can drop her off home at 4:30 when detention finishes. They told me about the ""late"" bus and I reminded them why Amanda couldn't take that bus and was told ""well, sounds like a natural consequence to me"". This isn't your average kid refusing to do something, being rude and deserving a long walk home as well as detention. This is a kid that could be seriously harmed if she was made to walk that far and on that road.

The Principal told me that I was ""making excuses"" and that Amanda needed to face consequences and I didn't technically need to give permission - they were making me aware. I agree that Amanda needs to face consequences for her language (which are that ~~she's grounded for the weekend~~, and has to serve any lunch detention the school gives her and apologising to the teacher for specifically her language - nothing else) - but putting her in danger is NOT right and that if they were insistent on this - I was insistent on taking my lunch break right now to drive over and pull her out for the rest of the day. (EDIT: The school called back and said she had 2 days of lunch detention - but my sister who lives interstate thinks I'm being one of ""those"" mums and told me I was in the wrong, hence posting) AITA?

Edit to update: I have since ungrounded Amanda and apologised and told her that I acted irrationally out of stress and anger at the school in the situation. I also told her it's up to her regarding the apology.  


Second update: I have added an [Updated post](https://www.reddit.com/user/TA_AITA_BadMum/comments/v9pcws/update_to_my_aita_post/) here. ",22348,v8c6gz,"NTA. 

Holy shit, the PE teacher needs to face consequences for THEIR behavior. I would not be talking to the principal about this because said principal seems incompetent. I would be calling the SCHOOL BOARD and reporting everyone and their mother for this behavior.

AITA for calling police on a neighbour after she keyed my car because of books I write,"I am a single woman in my early 30s, making my living writing and self-publishing adult fiction. By adult fiction, I mean, ADULT fiction with majority of the ‘plot’ being steamy. I don’t typically tell people what I write but I do tell them I write books for a living under a pen name (and if you’re questioning my writing abilities, I have an editor to correct my mistakes). I am not hiding it per se but I am not telling everyone I meet what I do for a living and none of my neighbours knew, only a bunch of friends.

I live in a house alone, pretty much of all my neighbours are either young families or retired couples. My next door neighbour is a young couple. We’ve been polite to each other but haven’t been close or anything.

Lately, the husband, let’s call him Roger, became very friendly towards me which I tried to ignore but he’s been getting too flirty for my liking, and I started avoiding him.

They had a BBQ over the bank holiday weekend, and I was taking rubbish out to put in my bin, Roger looked at me, waved ‘hi’ and whispered something to his friend and they both watched me very carefully which was incredibly creepy.

On my way through my garden, I saw Roger’s wife (Dalia) leaving the house with her friend and they both looked at me with disgust and whispered something to each other. It was weird and I hurried back inside.


The next morning, I found some religious leaflets put through my letter box. They were just printed on normal printer paper and were warning about lustful behaviour leading to hell, etc. Threw them away but kept finding similar leaflets put through my letter box for the next week.   

Since I am working from home, I decided to see who’s leaving those leaflets and to my surprise, it was Dalia. I decided to confront her and ask to stop putting religious leaflets through my door. Despite me being polite, she was not happy. She told me that I should rethink my life because what I write is disgusting (it’s pretty vanilla) and she found her husband reading it at night and you can imagine doing what. She kept going on and on how I am going to burn in hell, how I have no morals, etc. Well, I told her to stay away from me and discuss this with her husband and I closed the door in her face. Don’t know who, but someone told them what I do for a living. 
A day later, I found the word ‘sl*t’ painted on my door. A few days later, I caught her keying my car, she was almost done with the word ‘wh*re.’ Well, I called the police on her and since I installed cameras after the ‘sl*t’ incident, she is being taken to court over keying my car.

I talked to my other neighbour (she asked about the police) about it and she told me that I went overboard, that Dalia was clearly insecure but she’s a lovely woman and great mother and I should have talked to her instead of calling the police and give her a chance to change her behaviour. AITA for calling the police and not giving Dalia a chance?",22339,ul1d7q,"NTA.

You *did* talk to Dalla.  You *did* give her a chance.

AITA for eating my cupcake outside?,"I have a 10 years old daughter who loves frosting. Every week I buy cupcakes for me, my wife and her and she always eats my frosting. These past few weeks I decided to eat my cupcake before going inside. She asked me where my cupcake is and I told her I don't like cupcakes anymore so I only bought two. It worked for a while but last night when I was enjoying my cupcake before going inside she caught me and ran to her mom to tell her how much of a Terrible dad I am to ""steal her frostings for weeks""

She is sulking and my wife thinks I'm the ah and I'm acting childish and should just let her have it but it's easy for her to say when she has never given up HER frosting. AITA?

Edit: everyone is taking this very seriously lol. My daughter is not an entitled spoiled brat. Honestly I think she doesn't even love frosting that much she only does it to annoy me. I made this post because my wife likes this sub so I wanted to show her that I'm not the ah

Edit2: a lot happened since I posted here.

My wife is getting a divorce. She says she can't live with a liar. Cps came to our home to take our child away. They said we are terrible parents for letting our child eat frosting but by the time they got here our daughter wasn't home why? Because the cops came and arrested her for stealing a car. They said frosting thieves always become car thieves so there is no need waiting. She should go to jail asap. When she got there she called me and said she is going nc because I lied to her and she can't trust me anymore. Meanwhile we are getting calls from her friends telling us horror stories about our daughter bullying them. Our life is ruined. All because of a cupcake

Nahhh lol

So my daughter and I had a serious conversation about this problem and we came to an agreement. She said she'll stop stealing my frostings if I stop stealing her chips so we're good

XD

AITA for being hostile and rude to my sister's boyfriend over a joke he told my wife?,"
My sister (26) brought her new boyfriend (30) over to our parents house to meet him for the first time, My wife and I came as well.


We met the dude, he seemed ok-ish at first but he then started asking weird and personal questions. My wife had a breast cancer and got a single mastectomy last year. She told the story to my sister's boyfriend and he was like ""oh"" then he stared at my wife briefly then ""playfully"" said ""without even asking, I can pretty much tell which one got the blow"". We were floored, My wife could barely keep a straight face. she lied so she could leave the table cause she was literally about to tear up. I just looked at the dude and said ""Are you serious?"" he said ""What??!! I was just joking bro"" I started asking him to explain the joke to me, He just stared. I asked him again to explain it to me in details but still got no answer. My sister asked me to stop because clearly he got uncomfortable, but I insisted he explain the joke to me cause clearly....my wife and I didn't get it. Things got awkward with him avoiding eye contact while I just stared at him the entire time. I still insisted and asked him to explain the joke right there and then, but seconds later he said he needed to step outside to make a phone call. turns out he got in his car and left. My sister had a meltdown screaming and berating me for how I treated her boyfriend. Calling me hostle with anger issues to scare her boyfriend out of our parents house. I told her he was overstepping and made my wife uncomfortable to the point of crying, She actually called me wife ""such a princess"" and said she is soft and can not take some teasing. I had an argument with her and my parents intervened, I took my wife and left.


My dad called me later and said that he understood how hurt my wife felt but my sister's boyfriend was visiting for the first time and I showed hostility and agression instead of just ignoring him. He encouraged me to reach out to him and my sister later and talk it out but I declined.

AITA? Edit: My sister and my wife don't have a history but my sister tends to ""see"" the worst in people. When my wife announced her diagnosis, my sister actually thought she was ""faking"" because the family no longer brought up my wife's miscarriage months prior, I thought that was out of line and she apologized for it and we moved on.

AITA for grounding my 16yro son for a month after he called his stepdad a slur?,"I'm 43M, my son is 16M. I'm divorced (have been for a few years now) and my ex remarried recently. 

Her new husband (Jonathan) is black (we're white). He and my ex are now expecting a baby together. He also has 2 teenage boys himself. 

My ex and I share custody, but our son spends most of his time at my plase because he has more room and privacy here. 

Last weekend he was at his mom's and on Sunday, he called me all upset saying to come pick him up. I rushed over there and found out that he got into a fight with Jonathan over some chores and Jonathan locked him out of wifi and banned him from video games until he does his chores (which is how my ex and I also discipline him, and Jonathan has our permission to do the same if my son acts out - he can use the same methods he uses with his sons). More longterm/serious punishments are of course decided between my ex and I, but ""no video games today"" type of thing is totally fine for Jonathan to do. 

My ex and Jonathan then told me that my son got all upset over this punishment and told Jonathan to "" f*ck off"". Jonathan then told him to stop talking like that, to which my son replied ""you and your sons ruined my life, so you dont get to tell me what to do. I want take orders from a N anyway"". 

I asked my son if this is all true. He said yes. He actually called him the N word (because ""well isnt it true""). 

I lost it and told my son he is grounded for the whole month of December. My ex agreed. He is obviously annoyed and angry, because he had tons of plans with his friends. 

He said that I am overreacting to one word and am being unfair. My brother and mom agree with my son, and are saying that the punishment doesn't fit the crime.

AITA for holding my son's college fund hostage?,"I(48M) have a son that graduated this year from highschool.

We (my wife and I) started his college fund the minute we found out she was pregnant. Since we make good money (in the mid 6 figures), his college fund currently has almost $400k in it.

We have never told our son what to do with his life. We may have guided his decisions as any good parent should, but since he was still young we let him make his own decisions.

We also never expected academic excellence or forced him into sports or artistic activities.

Now that he graduated highschool, he said that he did not want to go to college. We said as long as he was sure, he could whatever he wanted. He refused trade schools too. He also did not want to work with us in our business.

He said that he planned to use his college fund to start a business of his own. I said that I will allow it only if he takes some Business Management, accounting and law classes in the nearby community college. I said that I would pay them out of pocket and not from the fund. And then I would expect a well made business plan before I would give him the money. My wife agrees 100%.

But he called us AHs for holding his college fund hostage to make him do what we want. We think we are just doing our best to make sure that his business succeeds.

So AITA?

Edit: Oh wow! I logged off 5 minutes after posting, logged back in expecting maybe 100 comments at most. Thank you everyone, I read every single one and decided to answer the most relevant questions here.

So the money is in my and my wife's name.
 
Some people said that this discussion should have been had earlier, well earlier he said he wanted to take a couple years off to work before going to college. It wasn't until earlier last week that he said he wanted to start a business.

Some people also say that he is spoiled and doesn't know how fast that money can disappear, and they are right. I ran away from an abusive home at 16, worked for my FIL and got paid under the table untill I was able to work legally. The only reason I have the money I do is that married the boss' daughter and her father left us a paid off house and a booming business (he moved to spain to enjoy retirement). I didn't even get my GED and go to college untill I had my kid. So I spoiled my kid like I wish I was spoiled.

That is also the reason why I asked, I live in fear of doing something that could make me like my parents, and I know this community is full of younger people who might give me a different perspective. So thank you everyone.",22318,vwuiw6,"NTA.

"AITA for telling the new neighbors that they got what they paid for, including being shunned by the neighborhood?","Where I live, real estate developers have started snatching up family homes, bulldozing them and building enormous 2 million dollar houses on the plots of land. The houses also stick out horribly in terms of aesthetics – think single level brick homes with a 3-level gigantic white and black box in the middle.

My home’s been in my family for several generations. We have always been known for having a large, beautiful garden. We invited over kids to help with gardening, we gave away so many veggies, we’d hold parties, etc. It’s been a neighborhood treasure for years.

Until developers snatched up the lot next door, bulldozed and erected an enormous house that blocked out the light to most of the garden. Many of us tried to fight it with the city but everything was denied. It was heartbreaking. Our neighborhood has been changed forever. This was a link to my family and I almost have had to go through a grieving process for it.

The new owners moved in and were not welcomed warmly by people in the neighborhood. I avoided them for as long as I could, other than politely waving or nodding. It was a young couple in their early 20s.

We finally came face to face and the woman asked if we could chat. She said that they felt like maybe they’d done something wrong when they moved in, or if they aren’t pulling in their trash bins or something, being too loud, etc, because people haven’t been very friendly. The guy says that he’s surprised considering it felt like a “nice” and somewhat “affluent” neighborhood, and given the price, he was expecting friendly neighbors.

I asked if they had done any research about the area. They said that they moved from California, so no. I said that maybe that was their mistake?

They said they didn’t know what I meant, so I asked if they’d ever looked in our backyard. They said yes and said they think the garden is cute.

I said “Yes, the garden that now has about half less sunlight than before that house was built was a neighborhood treasure.""

The guy said “Well it’s not our fault you built the garden there, is it?”

I said “Well, you guys got what you paid for. 2 million dollars for a house that everyone in the neighborhood hates.” I said that I hoped it was worth it and wished them a nice day.

When I told another neighbor about the exchange, she told me that she does feel bad for them moving without having any idea what they were getting themselves into.

AITA for telling them that they got what they paid for?",22309,xf6boo,"YTA, but you don’t have to be. You can fix this pretty easily. Make a pie, or buy a small housewarming gift, and bring it to your neighbor. Tell them, “You know, we fought against the builder who built your home, and it broke my heart when my garden lost its sunlight, but neither of those things are your fault. I should have been a better neighbor, and I’d like to fix that going forward.” And then tell your other neighbors that the new neighbors are perfectly nice, and that you apologized for the way you treated them.",13788,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xf6boo/aita_for_telling_the_new_neighbors_that_they_got/,"['live', 'real', 'estate', 'developers', 'started', 'snatching', 'family', 'homes', 'bulldozing', 'building', 'enormous', 'million', 'dollar', 'houses', 'plots', 'land', 'houses', 'also', 'stick', 'horribly', 'terms', 'aesthetics', '–', 'think', 'single', 'level', 'brick', 'homes', '-level', 'gigantic', 'white', 'black', 'box', 'middle', 'homes', 'family', 'several', 'generations', 'always', 'known', 'having', 'large', 'beautiful', 'garden', 'invited', 'kids', 'help', 'gardening', 'gave', 'away', 'many', 'veggies', 'wed', 'hold', 'parties', 'etc', 'its', 'neighborhood', 'treasure', 'years', 'developers', 'snatched', 'lot', 'next', 'door', 'bulldozed', 'erected', 'enormous', 'house', 'blocked', 'light', 'garden', 'many', 'us', 'tried', 'fight', 'city', 'everything', 'was', 'denied', 'was', 'heartbreaking', 'neighborhood', 'has', 'changed', 'forever', 'this', 'was', 'link', 'family', 'almost', 'go', 'grieving', 'process', 'new', 'owners', 'moved', 'welcomed', 'warmly', 'people', 'neighborhood', 'avoided', 'long', 'could', 'politely', 'waving', 'nodding', 'was', 'young', 'couple', 'early', 'finally', 'came', 'face', 'face', 'woman', 'asked', 'could', 'chat', 'said', 'felt', 'like', 'maybe', 'theyd', 'done', 'something', 'wrong', 'moved', 'pulling', 'trash', 'bins', 'something', 'being', 'loud', 'etc', 'because', 'people', 'very', 'friendly', 'guy', 'says', 'hes', 'surprised', 'considering', 'felt', 'like', 'nice', 'somewhat', 'affluent', 'neighborhood', 'given', 'price', 'was', 'expecting', 'friendly', 'neighbors', 'asked', 'done', 'any', 'research', 'area', 'said', 'moved', 'california', 'said', 'maybe', 'was', 'mistake', 'said', 'know', 'meant', 'asked', 'theyd', 'ever', 'looked', 'backyard', 'said', 'yes', 'said', 'think', 'garden', 'cute', 'said', 'yes', 'garden', 'has', 'half', 'less', 'sunlight', 'before', 'house', 'was', 'built', 'was', 'neighborhood', 'treasure', 'guy', 'said', 'well', 'its', 'fault', 'built', 'garden', 'said', 'well', 'guys', 'got', 'paid', 'million', 'dollars', 'house', 'everyone', 'neighborhood', 'hates', 'said', 'hoped', 'was', 'worth', 'wished', 'nice', 'day', 'told', 'another', 'neighbor', 'exchange', 'told', 'does', 'feel', 'bad', 'moving', 'without', 'having', 'any', 'idea', 'getting', 'themselves', 'aita', 'telling', 'got', 'paid']",live real estate developers started snatching family homes bulldozing building enormous million dollar houses plots land houses also stick horribly terms aesthetics – think single level brick homes -level gigantic white black box middle homes family several generations always known having large beautiful garden invited kids help gardening gave away many veggies wed hold parties etc its neighborhood treasure years developers snatched lot next door bulldozed erected enormous house blocked light garden many us tried fight city everything was denied was heartbreaking neighborhood has changed forever this was link family almost go grieving process new owners moved welcomed warmly people neighborhood avoided long could politely waving nodding was young couple early finally came face face woman asked could chat said felt like maybe theyd done something wrong moved pulling trash bins something being loud etc because people very friendly guy says hes surprised considering felt like nice somewhat affluent neighborhood given price was expecting friendly neighbors asked done any research area said moved california said maybe was mistake said know meant asked theyd ever looked backyard said yes said think garden cute said yes garden has half less sunlight before house was built was neighborhood treasure guy said well its fault built garden said well guys got paid million dollars house everyone neighborhood hates said hoped was worth wished nice day told another neighbor exchange told does feel bad moving without having any idea getting themselves aita telling got paid 
AITA for losing it on my fiancé for disinviting my stepsisters from our wedding?,"

I'm gonna keep it short. I f25 am getting married to my fiance next month, We've had no issues with the wedding planning except the ""guest list"". Context: I have a large family, I have 2 stepsisters (18, 20) and a biological brother (27) and also a biological sister (30). My fiance argued that the guest list should be cut short and suggested I only invite my ""immeditate family"", I asked him to elaborate and he suggested excluding my stepsisters. I said no and got upset with him for implying that they're not family, he said ""well, This wasn't what I meant..I was just speaking from a technical angle"", especially since I didn't include them in the wedding party like MOH and bridesmaids. So he thought they were""unneeded"" but I said they are wanted, and will always be wanted and included by me. Well, days ago, my stepsisters called saying my fiancé cancelled their invitations and told them some lie about changing wedding location and telling them they won't be able to come. I was fuming, I went home and started screaming at him, He asked that I hear him out then explained he had no choice since we were required to shorten the list, and he just did my ""dirty work for me"" since I obviously was looking at the situation from an ""emotional angle"" and couldn't bring myself to disinvite my stepsisters myself. I called him a hypocrite cause he invited almost 6 of his friends who, as far as I know, aren't immediate family. I told him he hurt my stepsisters by going behind my back and excluding them from  y wedding which they've been so excited about. He got up from the couch and yelled that it's our wedding so my stepsisters feelings aren't really that relevant compared to H.I.S and called me controlling for wanting my way or the highway. He took his phone amd stormed out to see his friends. Some of his friends called to ""scold"" me for how I'm treating ""their brother""and then went on about how rude I was to suggestthat ""their brother"" disinvite them from the wedding just because I don't like them and called it ""a you problem"". My fmil called and is wanting to sleak to me, he probably told her what's going on and she is probably going to ask that I apologize for yelling.",22295,ta7hyl,NTA. Girl run.

AITA for locking the door to prevent my husband from getting involved in my job interview?,"

I (/F33) am unemployed but God knows I had been looking for jobs (I'm a sale's rep) for well over 5 months, right after I recovered from my knee surgery.

My husband has a high paying job, first he suggested I leave my career as sales rep behind [not up to his wealthy family's standards, they'd mocked me for it a lot] and stay home but I refused because I love my job and want to grow in it. he suggested he finds me a better job since he has connections but that's not in my field.

I've had several job interviews and my husband has ruined all of them for me and here's how: he'd walk into the room whenever I'm having a potential job interview and introduce himself and take over the conversation with the interviewer, he'd tell them about how good I am but slip in some bad stuff that eventually cost me the job. His argument was that he's just making ""recommandations"" since he's connections and ""influence"" but I told him to stop and let me handle it. He sulked saying he was just trying to ""guide me"" and whatnot.

Several days ago, I'd gotten a job interview and after getting inside the room and before the interview started I locked the door. My husband tried to come in and started knocking on the door asking why I was locking the door and telling me to let him in. I put my headphones on and used noise cancelling but he kept knocking telling me to open the door.

After the interview was over I unlocked the door and walked out. He went off on me calling me disrespectful and awful to lock him out like that. I said I was sorry I wanted to work for this company so badly and I couldn't let him ruin it for me. He got offended and said that I was being petty and childish and also ungrateful because of the stunt I pulled and said that he was trying to help me get the best deal out there. I said I'm not a child but he said that yes I was especially with how I behaved and for ""excluding"" him from my interview.",22195,uwwb1b,NTA please lock down your birth control so he can’t interfere with that.

AITA for not going to my mom’s house for Christmas and refusing to make my little sister go too?,"I’m 17 and my little sister is 15. Our dad died about 10 years ago. It was sudden and devastating. One day he kissed and hugged me and sis and told us he loved us and then we never heard from him again. At the time I couldn’t fully grasped why he chose to stay away even though mom tried to explain it to us. I missed him and thought I did something wrong to make dad mad. I repeatedly called his phone hoping he would answer but it always went directly to his voicemail.

At his funeral, I realized I would never see him again and I broke down. I don’t remember much from that day except Uncle David held me the entire time. He held me throughout the funeral, during the drive home, and as I fell asleep that night. Uncle Alan did the same thing with sis.

It wasn’t easy growing up with just my mom and sis but not as tough as it could have been because the two uncles were always a phone call away. Whenever we needed help with school, one of the uncles was there to tutor us. One of them was always in the front row of every school performance and game. Whenever I wake up in the middle of the night and miss dad, I’ll call Uncle David and know he’ll always pick up.

My mom eventually remarried to Bob. I never liked Bob because he always have to be in control and placed us on a strict schedule. Dinner was at 7 everyday no matter what. If we came home late and dinner was over, we weren’t allowed to eat that night. Whenever our uncles gave me and sis money, we had to give it to Bob and he divided the money equally.

A couple of months ago, sis and I were eating with Uncle David and his family. Our dinner conversation eventually led to where I want to go for college and how to pay for it. Uncle David told me that the uncles decided long ago they were going to pay for me and sis’s tuition and cost of living on campus. I cried when I heard that and laughed when he jokingly said he hope I don’t get into medical school because that’s going to cost him a fortune.

I went home and excitedly told mom and Bob that the uncles are going to pay for our colleges. Instead of being happy, they both looked furious and Bob started screaming about how unfair it was to our step siblings and half sister that we’re getting a free ride through college. He wanted me to tell our uncles to divided the college funds equally among the kids but I refused. The next day he kept on screaming at us so sis and I packed our bags to go to Uncle David’s house. He kept on screaming and even followed us out to my car.

Sis and I have been living Uncle David and his family ever since. This feels more like home that it ever did at our house. Mom has been asking us to come home for Christmas for a month now and I’ve been refusing. Today is the 24th and she’s been calling all morning crying and saying how we need to spend Christmas with family.

AITA for leaving dinner at my husband's family's house over a comment he made about my miscarriage?,"


My husband and I have been trying to have kids for 3 years. I've had a series of MCs and not a single pregnancy was successful. Our recent MC was a month ago. And although my husband never said anything (up until now) These have such trying to times for me personally, the tension and emotions are very overwhelming and I've become too sensitive even at the mention of the topic.


He took me to his family's house for dinner last night and my MC was brought up by his mom. The look of disappointment on her face made me lose my appetite completely. She went on and on about what may have caused it then my husband chimed in and said that he's starting to come to a conclusion that ""maybe I'm 'incapable' of being a mom"" I was floored for two reasons. One is that he'd even say such thing. Two is that no doctor has told me that there was something wrong with me specifically so for him to declare I was ""incapable"" of bearing children and being a mom hurt like a sting. I looked at him and he was like ""what???"" Then told me to not get offended since he was just being honest. He said he loves me and thinks I'm perfect but still thinks that ""I'm flawed in that area"" referring to motherhood. I had it at that point, I just got up from my seat and took my stuff and headed to the door. I said nothing just made my way out. He shouted at me but I didn't stop.


I went home and he came and started unloading on me about how immature and too sensitive and ridiculous I was being. He said he was giving his honest opinion about the matter and I have no right to police the words that come out of his mouth whether I like what I'm hearing or not it's still *the truth*. We argued some then we stopped talking altogether. He keeps saying I exaggerated and walked during dinner and disrespected him and his family over literally nothing.

AITA for refusing to take my daughter to my ex husband’s wedding?,"My (42F) ex husband (45M) and I were together for 20 years. We had a beautiful daughter together, Joceline (14F). We got a divorce 5 years ago due to infidelity on his part. I was devastated. He was the love of my life and he betrayed all of the trust and loyalty we had built up. To make matters worse, he ended up in a relationship with the woman he cheated on me with. They got engaged one year later and are set to be married in two weeks. Honestly, I still am heartbroken over my divorce. It’s hurtful to me that we were together for 20 years, and he could just go fall in love with someone else, as if I was nothing. However, Joceline was only 9 when we divorced, and he’s a great father so I would never want to come in between their bond. Joceline loves his fiancée as she’s very sweet to her, but she doesn’t know the reason why her dad and I divorced, I want to tell her when she’s a bit older and he doesn’t want to tell her at all. Anyways, I compromised with him that Joceline could come to the wedding, but that he would have to provide the transportation to and from the wedding, as I want no part of it. I don’t want to drop my daughter off at his wedding, I don’t want to see all the decorations and the happy guests, it’d just be too much for me. I didn’t tell him all of that obviously, but he agreed.

Today he calls me and asks if he can ask for a huge favor. It turns out that his future in laws are flying in the morning of the wedding, and he has to go pick them up, therefore he can’t pick up my daughter the day of and wanted to ask if I could take her. I said absolutely not and asked why he can’t pick her up the day before when she gets off of school. He said he doesn’t want to make the drive twice, and that he will likely not have time as he has to prepare for the rehearsal dinner. I asked why can’t the bride pick up her parents, he said she’ll be getting her hair done and won’t be able to. I laughed and told him there was no way I’d take my daughter, and that he’d have to figure it out.

Boy why did I say that. My daughter ran downstairs crying, face beet red 10 minutes after my conversation with her dad, calling me terrible and accusing me of not wanting her to spend time with her dad. I told her that’s not the case and she demanded to know why I couldn’t take her, I couldn’t give her an answer and she ran upstairs crying. Now I’m getting messages from his family calling me “heartless” and “cold” and a “bitch” for trying to “ruin his special day over a relationship that is long over”. My family understands my point of view. But I feel terrible that I’ve upset my daughter. I don’t know what to do. AITA? Should I just put aside my feelings and take her?",22177,xel99t,"He couldn't find *any* trustable adult to pick his daughter up? There must be someone? An uncle? Grandma? No one?

Edit: honestly, I think OP should have a heart to heart conversation with her daughter and explain the reason why she's not comfortable driving her to the wedding. It's not fair to have the dad creating all this caos in OP's life and also not wanting the cheating story to be revealed. Soon or later, the daughter will find out. Cheaters are eventually outed. Having a distant relative or someone she's not close to telling her that her mom got cheated on will possibly make the daughter feel left out.

AITA for saying it’s a little embarrassing that a girl’s nanny puts little notes in her lunch,"So, this girl, Nicole(16), started going to my (16f) school after winter break. She’s a little weird tbh. She doesn’t talk a lot and when she does talk, she’s so quiet that you can barely hear her. 

She used to eat in her car but one of my friends felt bad for her and invited her to eat with us. I noticed that all of her lunches had a little piece of paper and she’d read it, smile for like 2 seconds, then fold it up and put it in a pocket in her lunchbox. Sometimes she’d take it out and read it a couple times during lunch.

I eventually asked what it is and she said she has a nanny and she writes her notes every day. I asked if she thinks that’s a little embarrassing because I don’t know anyone who’s had notes in their lunches past 5th grade. 

She got kinda defensive and said that her nanny does similar things for her siblings, who are all in preschool or elementary school so it kinda proved my point. 

She started eating in her car again and one of my friends got mad at me because apparently she had a really bad home life before moving here and she’s never had anyone do that stuff for her. Idk how tf she expected me to know, considering she usually only talks about school but it’s starting some drama in my friend group so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.",22168,tb14vi,"YTA, you made someone feel bad about something that brings them joy for a brief moment.

AITA for kicking my SIL out for eating my order?,"

My husband's sister moved in with us after a major argument about the baby's name (they're expecting and she's 7 months in!). she's known be picky and refuses to eat what what we normally cook.

We only cook her favorite food, which I can't eat (allergies yay!!) Everyday at dinner I have to figure out what to eat since she only eats food that I'm allergic to.


Last night, My husband agreed that he'd cook for her and cook for us together seperately. I got home after a long day at work and found out that SIL convinced my husband to only cook the meal she wanted and cancel on the meal we planned to have. I saw them eating together in the kitchen. My husband apologitically said his sister convinced him to eat with her and not cook the meal I wanted us both to have. I said it was FINE then went to order some food from the restaurant.


I went to take a shower and did some work on my laptop then came downstairs to find my order placed on the kitchen counter. It was open and someone ate the majority of it. I turned around and there was SIL standing saying she woke up hungry and couldn't ""resist"" the smell that was coming out of the box. I lost it and yelled at her asking wtf she did that but she said that she did save me some which isn't true because there was only some rice and dressings. We started arguing and I told her I couldn't take this anymore and told her to pack her shit and leave first thing in the morning. She began crying and my husband got involved and defended her up and down repeatedly saying she's pregnant and is eating for 2 basically. He suggested I go make myself something quick from the fridge and let it go but I refused and a bigger argument ensued.

Eating for two is not a license to be a selfish asshole.  She ATE, then knowing you'd ordered food because you couldn't eat the food she INSISTED on having, she ate yours, TOO.

The fuck?!

I would have shouted the house down.  She has a husband to torture, he signed up for that shit not you.  I'll bet she is used to the world revolving around her.

She's a shit for being selfish, and sorry but your husband is a shit for not putting his foot down and defending your boundaries.  She doesn't care, because her brother hasn't yanked her up short and explained how it's not ok to be a selfish asshole to his wife, her host.

I am Mexican, she is American, but we both grew up in the US and both our families know both languages. My wife planned every bit of the wedding and was a very controlling and nervous bride, but alright, I get that she was stressed. 

During the reception I went to the band and asked them to play a song for me to sing to my new wife. It was Te Amare by Miguel Bose. It was the song from out first date in a really bad Mexican restaurant, so it became a long standing joke between us. 

The guests really loved the song, my MIL cried and told me it was beautiful, but my bride seemed upset. I asked her what's wrong and she said I am an AH for taking the spotlight to enforce my ethnicity and not just let the band sing our song for us.

AITA for telling my sister that she should have gone to college if she wanted a life like mine?,"Hello everyone, please excuse my grammar. English is my 4th language and 100% self taught. Also this will be a long post. 

My sister and I are twins (33F). We come from a culture where arranged marriages are an option (not India). Mostly they are blind dates set by a matchmaker. And if you are compatible you marry. 

When we both graduated highschool, my sister (who was valedictorian BTW) chose not to attend college. She asked for an arranged marriage since all she wanted to be was a wife and mother (nothing wrong with that). My parents (who are a love match) tried to convince her to at least get her bachelor's. She refused. I on the other hand started attending an engineering college (computer engineering) 

A year later she married a man that she met through the matchmaker. He is a very nice man, a teacher and treats my sister like a queen. The thing is he was just a freshly hired teacher. My sister went from living in a double income house with parents being both high earners (a doctor and a lawyer) to a single income house on a teacher's salary. 

I graduated at 23, started working as a cyber security personnel for a big bank. After 2 years of dating around, I too asked for an arranged marriage. 

My husband is a business owner (real estate developer) and he makes a lot more than I do. He also comes from money. 

My sister didn't like him from the get go, she even threw a tantrum (thankfully in private) in my wedding. Apparently the bride gifts he brought were tacky (more like very expensive, more than what yer husband could get her) 

The problem is that my first child is now at the age where she will be starting pre-school, we signed her for a private school. The monthly tuition is more than what her husband makes. 

When she heard this she just exploded. She was ranting about how it's not fair that our kids will not have equal opportunities, how the only reason I could live like I do was that my parents chose a better husband for me. 

I became angry, for how she treats me, how unfair she was to her husband and my parents, so I laid the truth on her, I told her I got matched with a better husband because I am a college educated woman with a respectable job, and that wealthy men using matchmakers don't want 19 years old highschool graduates, their standards are higher. I told her that her husband is a wonderful man who loves her, but if all she wanted was wealthy man she should have gone to college. 

Now she is NC with me, she says that I am an elitist AH. 

So AITA?",22016,v2so1r,"NTA. 

She's jealous/envious of your life because you decided to go through college and became successful. Also, how horrible she is to be talking about someone she presumably loves. Sounds like she was only marrying for money, not for love.

You told her point blank what it is. If she wanted a wealthy husband, she should've went to college. Her decisions/choices are the reason why her life is the way it is.

AITA for telling my sister I will no longer give her my breast milk?,"I (28F) had a stillbirth 5 weeks ago. My sister gave birth to a healthy baby boy 4 weeks ago. After my stillbirth, I was producing milk and pumping, and my sister couldn't breastfeed after her son was born. Formula shortage was awful and I was literally throwing my milk away, so I offered it to my sister and she gladly accepted. 

I was advised by the doctors to pump for 3 weeks after the stillbirth to prevent problems for me, and then stop, otherwise I'd just keep producing milk. Due to the formula shortage, I have been pumping for 5 weeks now, to give the milk to my sister. Now that there is more formula in stock and she has been able go buy it, I told her I'll stop pumping. 

She told me her son has stomach problems after the formula and asked me to keep pumping. I told her I emotionally cannot handle it any longer. She said I am being selfish and she already has to feed her son by bottle (because she at first suggested I'd just nurse him for his daily feedings at least - we live next door, and I refused). 

I told her I'm sorry and I can pump for a few more days so she can put some in the freezer and have some back up until she finds a better formula for her son, but she said breast milk is healthiest and I should just help her out. 

She called me a selfish AH and said that I am the embodient of 'misery loves company'. My mother feels I should help my own sister out. My husband said my sister is way out of line. I feel really awful because I could still help her out and I know she needs it.

AITA for snitching and causing my friend to lose her scholarship/dream college acceptance?,"I (19F) am a sophomore in college and have a friend, Tia (18F), who is in high school and applying for colleges and scholarships. I helped her throughout the college process and she ended up getting in early action to her top college, and she got a full scholarship. I was happy for her until recently. 

I was talking to a mutual friend of ours and she started gushing about how Tia’s essay was so heartfelt and beautiful. I asked to see it because I thought she had just forgotten to show me (she showed me many of her essay drafts). But as I was reading it, I was completely taken aback. The essay was one of MY college essay drafts which I’d shown to Tia for reference on writing TECHNIQUES ONLY. I made this clear. 

I was livid. The essay was really personal, and she barely even tweaked it up. It was almost entirely copied and pasted. I trusted her with it, and this is what she did. 

In a fit of rage, I gathered all the evidence of me helping her with the college process, including evidence of me sending the specific essay to her, and I showed it to the school. She not only lost her scholarship, but she also lost her seat in the school. 

Now, people are calling me dramatic and shaming me for robbing her of her education. She’s the only person in her family to get into college and receive an academic and athletic scholarship, so everyone was rooting for her, including me at one time. And while I didn’t expect the outcome to be so severe, it was. 

Right now, I feel bad. I feel terrible. I feel like she took advantage of me, but I didn’t want to be the cause of something so horrible. I did myself a justice, but at the cost of someone’s dreams. Now I’m wondering if what I did was justified or not. 

AITA?

AITA for ordering takeout after my husband tricked me to cook for his kids?,"
AITA? Hello. So to give some context, I f35 have been married to my husband, m37 for 6 months. He has 2 children from two different (uninvolved) mothers and they live with us full time. The kids are 7y.o. And 10y.o.


I work long hours and it's a demanding job time wise. My husband thinks that just because I wfh that I can pause whenever but it's untrue. He'd ask me to do things for the kids or him during work hours, but I told him I'm working and unavailable during those hours, and that the kids are his responsibilty til I'm done.


Yesterday, He told me he wanted to go attend a friend's engagement dinner and asked if I could ""take time off work"" to make the kids dinner. I told him absolutely not, and insisted that he cook for them or order takeout. He said he had no time to cook, and takeout was off the table since he doesn't want them to eat fast food. He later said fine and that he was going to cook dinner then go to the party.


2hrs later, the kids came in and said they were hungry. I was puzzled, I asked if their dad cooked them dinner and they said he didn't. Moreover!!! He told them to come ask me to cook for them at exactly 7pm. I was so pissed to find myself in this situation. I took few minutes off the meeting and ordered takeout from the nearby restaurant and fed the kids, then had them watch tv then go to sleep.


He came home at 11PM and went off on me after he discovered that I didn't cook like he was counting on me to do. Not only that, but he yelled about feeding the kids takeout. I argued back saying I had no choice after he basically tricked me into cooking for them knowing I was busy, so I ordered food and made sure the kids were fed while I focused on work. He ranted about how I care more about work than my stepchildren (God forbid) and called me selfish then went upstairs and refused to talk to me. He's still sulking about it today and says I need to get my priorities ""in order"" cause they're messed up.


Info - About that friend's engagement. My husband has this friend from college. They're close and he couldn't miss the event. Moreover, he said he was upset with me for missing the event and now refusing to cook a homemade healthy meal and ordering takeout knowing it's a ""no go"" for him.

Info - The reason I expected him to cook other than the fact that I was busy, was that he usually cooks for them so it's both of our responsibility.

Info - Does he work? Yes, but barely. He works at a warehouse only twice a week. His friend's dad owns the warehouse and do he has a lot of leverage.

Info - More context on the mothers. One is an ex wife, the other is an ex girlfriend. Both left for financial reasons he said but I'm not fully convinced by that.",22000,y80jvd,"INFO: Aside from stepkids and audacity, what does he bring to the table?",5236,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/y80jvd/aita_for_ordering_takeout_after_my_husband/,"['aita', 'hello', 'give', 'context', 'married', 'husband', 'months', 'has', 'children', 'two', 'different', 'uninvolved', 'mothers', 'live', 'us', 'full', 'time', 'kids', 'yo', 'yo', 'work', 'long', 'hours', 'its', 'demanding', 'job', 'time', 'wise', 'husband', 'thinks', 'because', 'wfh', 'pause', 'whenever', 'its', 'untrue', 'hed', 'ask', 'things', 'kids', 'during', 'work', 'hours', 'told', 'im', 'working', 'unavailable', 'during', 'hours', 'kids', 'his', 'responsibilty', 'til', 'im', 'done', 'yesterday', 'told', 'wanted', 'go', 'attend', 'friends', 'engagement', 'dinner', 'asked', 'could', 'take', 'time', 'work', 'make', 'kids', 'dinner', 'told', 'absolutely', 'insisted', 'cook', 'order', 'takeout', 'said', 'time', 'cook', 'takeout', 'was', 'table', 'since', 'want', 'eat', 'fast', 'food', 'later', 'said', 'fine', 'was', 'going', 'cook', 'dinner', 'go', 'party', 'hrs', 'later', 'kids', 'came', 'said', 'hungry', 'was', 'puzzled', 'asked', 'dad', 'cooked', 'dinner', 'said', 'moreover', 'told', 'come', 'ask', 'cook', 'exactly', 'pm', 'was', 'pissed', 'find', 'this', 'situation', 'took', 'minutes', 'meeting', 'ordered', 'takeout', 'nearby', 'restaurant', 'fed', 'kids', 'watch', 'tv', 'go', 'sleep', 'came', 'home', 'pm', 'went', 'discovered', 'cook', 'like', 'was', 'counting', 'only', 'yelled', 'feeding', 'kids', 'takeout', 'argued', 'back', 'saying', 'choice', 'basically', 'tricked', 'cooking', 'knowing', 'was', 'busy', 'ordered', 'food', 'made', 'sure', 'kids', 'fed', 'focused', 'work', 'ranted', 'care', 'work', 'stepchildren', 'god', 'forbid', 'called', 'selfish', 'went', 'upstairs', 'refused', 'talk', 'hes', 'still', 'sulking', 'today', 'says', 'need', 'get', 'priorities', 'order', 'cause', 'theyre', 'messed', 'info', '-', 'friends', 'engagement', 'husband', 'has', 'this', 'friend', 'college', 'theyre', 'close', 'miss', 'event', 'moreover', 'said', 'was', 'upset', 'missing', 'event', 'refusing', 'cook', 'homemade', 'healthy', 'meal', 'ordering', 'takeout', 'knowing', 'its', 'go', 'info', '-', 'reason', 'expected', 'cook', 'fact', 'was', 'busy', 'was', 'usually', 'cooks', 'its', 'responsibility', 'info', '-', 'does', 'work', 'yes', 'barely', 'works', 'warehouse', 'only', 'twice', 'week', 'his', 'friends', 'dad', 'owns', 'warehouse', 'has', 'lot', 'leverage', 'info', '-', 'context', 'mothers', 'one', 'ex', 'wife', 'ex', 'girlfriend', 'left', 'financial', 'reasons', 'said', 'im', 'fully', 'convinced']",aita hello give context married husband months has children two different uninvolved mothers live us full time kids yo yo work long hours its demanding job time wise husband thinks because wfh pause whenever its untrue hed ask things kids during work hours told im working unavailable during hours kids his responsibilty til im done yesterday told wanted go attend friends engagement dinner asked could take time work make kids dinner told absolutely insisted cook order takeout said time cook takeout was table since want eat fast food later said fine was going cook dinner go party hrs later kids came said hungry was puzzled asked dad cooked dinner said moreover told come ask cook exactly pm was pissed find this situation took minutes meeting ordered takeout nearby restaurant fed kids watch tv go sleep came home pm went discovered cook like was counting only yelled feeding kids takeout argued back saying choice basically tricked cooking knowing was busy ordered food made sure kids fed focused work ranted care work stepchildren god forbid called selfish went upstairs refused talk hes still sulking today says need get priorities order cause theyre messed info - friends engagement husband has this friend college theyre close miss event moreover said was upset missing event refusing cook homemade healthy meal ordering takeout knowing its go info - reason expected cook fact was busy was usually cooks its responsibility info - does work yes barely works warehouse only twice week his friends dad owns warehouse has lot leverage info - context mothers one ex wife ex girlfriend left financial reasons said im fully convinced 
AITA for telling my dad (who left) that I don't remember him?,"I'm 15F and my father is 46M.

My dad left the family when I was 7 without any explanation. He just vanished one day, and I've never seen him since. He left because of relationship issues with my mom. She was heartbroken, and waited 5 years for him to return - but in the end filed for divorce. Thankfully, she's over him now.

To be honest, now - 8 years after he left, I barely have any memory of him. Only some resentment for the years of suffering he put my mom and sister (19F) through. They tried and tried to contact him, but he'd never respond. I can't remember his voice, personality, or even face much. 

Last week, he texted my mother and said he wanted to meet, after 8 years of disappearance. My mom agreed. We arranged a meet-up at a nearby restaurant. My sister was so nervous/excited, but I realised I felt nearly nothing. 

He arrived, and my mom and sister started crying. He cried too, at the sight of his 'beloved daughters'. He saw that I looked quite emotionless, and said ""Don't you miss your dad?"" I replied honestly that I didn't remember him. He left so long, it's like I barely knew him. 

He was so shocked and hurt. Eventually, he cut off our 'meet-up' early, claiming he had to work. My mom and sister were so mad, they blamed it on me. My mom said that my sister's been waiting to see her dad for so long, but I had to make a stupid remark and make him leave a second time. Asking how I could behave like this towards my *dad*. Telling me that I'm a selfish bitch and asshole.

I'm sorry that he cut the meet-up short, 'cause I knew my sister missed him so damn much. But to be honest, I don't feel bad for saying the truth.

AITA for telling my fiancée she’s not the breadwinner if she’s not footing the bills in front of our families and friends?,"My fiancée and I moved in together shortly before we got engaged. Before we did, we discussed how we'd split the housework and bills. 50/50 down the middle with some wiggle room for when the other needs help. When we moved, it was into her parents' 2-story garage that they converted into basically an apartment. They offered a low rent (700 total), and pitch in for the electric and internet so we could save money for our own place and wedding.

My fiancée earns more than me and that's cool, I'm proud of her. Before we moved in together it always seemed like she was living paycheck to paycheck and I chalked it up to the apartment she had prior having insane high rent.

She stuck to the 50/50 arrangement at first concerning bills but she missed often and I had to remind her about it. Post-engagement, she's back to living paycheck to paycheck, either missing or very late with her part of the rent monthly, the two utilities we pay, groceries, late with her car payment. Her parents have talked to me multiple times about rent and I've covered her missing portion to get us caught up, and then try talking to her. It always turns into her saying we should just move if her parents are going to hound us. I told her we're lucky its her parents because anywhere else would've kicked our asses out. On top of that, I pay my own bills, do about 65% housework, arrange and pay for most of our dates and vacations, gifts for her, pay most towards our pets.

I've suggested a financial coach but what kicks me is whenever we're around others, she boasts about being the breadwinner since she earns more. Goes on about the stresses of being the main source of income, all the hours she has to work to ""pay all our bills"". I was letting it slide until few days ago we were at a get together. She and her sister started up again about her being the breadwinner. Her sister said something to the effect of her ex-boyfriend had a hard time being with someone who earned more, and my fiancée went ""Good thing OP doesn't mind me bringing home the pay"".

I told her just because she earns more doesn't make her the breadwinner when she blows it all on herself and I'm paying most the bills. She's embarrassed now and keeps saying I made her look bad and got her in trouble with her parents because they want to see what she spends her money on each month, but I don't think I did anything wrong. AITA?

Update: 11 last night I was ready to just postpone the engagement, as of this morning after a lot of talking and things coming to light, we are broken up. Thank you everyone for your responses and input, especially those who encouraged looking deeper. Quick summary:

\- She felt a joint account would impede her financial independence.

\- She insisted 'we' could afford her purchases based off our total incomes.

\- Her parents were under the impression she was also paying off my student loans, my car, my phone, and paying for our vacations.

\- She didn't get evicted from her last apartment but she was late with her rent often enough that they weren't going to renew her lease, so she didn't suggest us moving to a bigger apartment at her building.

\- Biggest 'Nope I'm out' the monthly take home amount she told me was what she earned BEFORE wage garnishment kicked in, in addition to mass debt. She's been doing some online stuff to make up for the money she loses due to that.

Yes, I got the ring back. Again, thank you everyone but I will not be responding to anymore comments. I'm going to go take some time for myself and get shit figured out.",21953,v78ax5,"NTA.  What makes a breadwinner a breadwinner is being the primary financial support pillar for the household.  She’s not doing it, but she wants people to regard her as doing it.  Honestly, I’m a little weireded out by her bragging about it - my mom was the breadwinner all my life (my dad’s salary was typically about 1/3 of hers, and he was in a much less stable industry until I was in college, so he had under-employment and unemployment sometimes), and they really didn’t say much about it ever, because they regarded all of their combined income as something that belonged

AITA for taking my wife’s side after she screamed and cursed at my mother?,"On mobile, throwaway. This just happened and my wife is currently sleeping while my mom is blowing up my phone. 

*Added some edits at the bottom!*

I (33m) am married to my wonderful wife Melody (29f) and she is currently pregnant with our first child together. I have a 6 year old daughter Tina who’s mother I split 50/50 custody with, so I know for the most part what Melody needs in order to feel supported while she carries our child. I have been spending lots of time making sure she’s comfortable and taking on more of the load at home so she’s not doing too much, this is her first child after all and it’s obviously a lot for her physically and emotionally. 

My mother and Melody don’t get along too well, mom didn’t like my ex either (we broke up because we were headed on different paths not because of my mother and there’s no bad blood) so I think she just doesn’t like her because she’s dating me for whatever reason it’s weird. She’s very nit picky about Melody, how much she does around the house, how emotional she is (Melody already cries very easily and being pregnant has made her even more sensitive which is fine), the fact that she wants to be a stay at home mom, it just seems like nothing Melody does is okay. I do however stand up for her and do not just allow my mom to talk down to her.

Today before picking up my daughter from summer camp Melody went to 3 different grocery stores to find rotisserie chicken, she’s been talking about it since last night and really really wanted one lol. She sent me picture messages documenting her quest for the chicken and finally found it. My girl was HAPPY. Rotisserie chicken is also kind of a comfort food for her like spaghetti because her mom used to make one of those when she was “having a lazy day” and didn’t feel like cooking. She was planning on serving that with some other basic sides for dinner, perfectly fine by me. My mother came by to see Tina and started telling Melody the chicken is bad for her and she should not be eating that pregnant. Melody said it’s fine, she usually eats healthy and just wants this one thing she’s craving. My mom went on about how unhealthy it was and said she needs to eat something else. Melody said no and went to the backyard to FaceTime her family (out of state). When she came back my mom had thrown out the food and ordered take out, a salad for Melody and pizza for everyone else. Melody asked where the chicken was and my mother told her she needs to start being a responsible mother and eat correctly for the baby. Melody screamed “WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SUCH A BITCH TO ME?” She then started crying and called me home. I came back and asked my mother to leave after hearing her story and said she is not to come back until she apologizes for how she treated Melody. My mom went on about how I’m choosing another woman over her but I just think enough is enough and Melody reached her limit. She apologized to me for blowing up when Tina was in the house but I told her it’s okay tings happen, Tina is okay and I went to find her another chicken before the store closed. My dad thinks I’m right for taking Melodys side but my brother thinks I should always defend mom so AITA?

EDIT: Okay not to be that guy but I did NOT expect this to get so much attention? I woke up to so many notifications and I’m going to try to go through as many as I can but wow thank you guys for all the support and awards! Melody loves all the kind messages from all of you especially the “mamas & soon to be mamas who get it” as she put it lol

1. My mom claimed it was the seasonings & fat/grease that made the chicken bad for her. It’s all BS but that’s what she claimed. 

2. I do plan on having a sit down with both my parents and my brother with my mom. A LOT of you have mentioned emotional incest (which is creeping me out) and other things along those lines that need to be addressed. I’ll talk to my dad first then have a family meeting. A lot of you asked why I would still want my mom around and honestly maybe I’m just weak but that’s my mother, however if she cannot learn to change and respect my family then we will just have to go NC. It’s hard but it is what it is. Melody doesn’t even want to completely cut her out she just wants change as well. But I will protect Melody at all costs and if that means cutting off my mom then so be it.

3. My ex and I did not break up because of my mother. We had different ideas of where our lives were going. Tina was not planned and we were already heading towards going our separate ways before she got pregnant. We tried to make it work for Tina but that’s not what relationships are about, so we split and it’s working great. My ex and Melody get along great, Tina is happy and we work through things as one big blended family. My ex and Melody have talked about my mother with each other before and that was when I realized I needed to see a therapist to work through my childhood with a mom like mine. It’s a process. I’m working through it the best I can.

4. Some people asked about our culture, we are all Black Americans. So I think it’s more of a mom son thing than a cultural thing.

5. Not sure how to update (someone please comment and let me know!) but I’ll update after I speak to my dad & have the family meeting. Lots of you recommended JustNoMIL & RaisedByNarcissists (i think those are the page names) and I will definitely check them out

6. Melody’s pregnancy is going smoothly for the most part! Just “exhausting and emotional” as she put it. Also we’re having a girl! We had our gender reveal last week for those who were wondering and thank you for all the well wishes! #GirlDad 🙌🏾

EDIT 2: I did find her another chicken yesterday night after this whole fiasco! Thanks for everyone who recommended we get a Costco card, that way she won’t have to go on another chicken quest 😂",21936,wjq45k,"NTA but your mom sure is.

"AITA for calling my brother a “sore, slow loser?”","Throwaway account.

My wife, “Irene,” is very fit.  She likes working out and has a proper exercise regime etc. She believes that if she “feels good” she “looks good,” and she feels good working out, so who am I to stop her? 

My brother, “Will,” spent the latter half of last year going through a messy divorce and now needs a place to stay. Though my brother and I aren’t very close, I figured he would only stay with us for a couple weeks until he got back on his feet. 

Will is a typical “gym rat.” He’s always on a very strict diet, always working out and bragging about his “gains.” I’ve worked out with him a few times and he’s a little obnoxious. He’s always mad at you if you don’t work at his pace and is always trying to correct your form. He’s a pretty fit and muscular guy, but I don’t like to exercise with him. 

Will has been pushing Irene to  workout with him because, according to him, “she won’t be able to keep up with him.” Irene mostly just shrugs him off with a laugh and tells him she would love to workout with him. Irene works out in the mornings (3 times a week) and then does a run in the evening, but she’s been busy this past week and hasn’t been able to stick to her usual schedule. Will thinks that she’s making excuses because she doesn’t want to be “embarrassed” by him. Again, Irene just laughs him off. 

About two days ago, Irene and Will went on an early morning run. I didn’t go with them, but the first thing I heard when Will entered the house was, “The only reason I couldn’t keep up with you (Irene) is because you were sweating too much.” I found this extremely comical, and kinda just laughed him off. Irene rolled her eyes and went to take a shower, so I thought that the conversation would die.

However, Will just kept bringing up my wife’s sweat.

My wife went to work and he told her, “to make sure she doesn’t sweat through her clothes,” or when she called me in the middle of day, he yelled, “tell the sweaty bitch I said hi.” Of course, the bitch comment aggravated me and I told him to knock it off and stop acting like a child.

I thought that was the end of it, but he just kept going.  By the end of the day, I was tired of his comments, but Irene seemed rather unphased by them. When she served him food, he made a comment about her “sweating into the food.” At this point, I was at my wits end and I told him to stop acting like a “sore, slow (referring to his running pace) loser and eat his food.” Will, of course got angry, and said the only reason he was going slower than usual was because he was “distracted by my wife’s unhygienic sweat.”  Irene looked a bit offended by this, and I told Will that I would kick him out if he made another comment like that.

He’s been super pissed ever since. I jokingly told this story to a mutual friend and they agreed with Will. Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh.

UPDATE: I didn't expect this amount of responses. Thank you for all the advice!

AITA for giving my husband one day to return the bracelet that he took from his daughter's mom?,"
It's a bit complicated, so bear with me. 

I f34 have been with my husband m37 for 2 years, he has a 9 year old daughter with his ex wife (Nora) and the reason for the divorce was financial. but she told me he initiated after she got diagnosed with cancer. Now cancer has come back and I feel sorry for her because she's a decent woman overall. 

Due to treatment schedule Nora only gets visitation with my stepdaughter for now, my husband drives my stepdaughter to see her mom 2 days a week. 

Yesterday he came home saying Nora wasn't home and he and my stepdaughter had to leave after waiting for an hour. He then went into the bedroom, stayed there for sometime then went out to visit his friend. 

I was cleaning the bedroom and found a gold bracelet that looked familiar, I realized it belonged to Nora as I'd seen her wear it before. I was confused I waited til he got home to ask him about it. His reaction wasn't good, he lashed out and took it out of my hand saying I shouldn't touch his personal stuff. I said this wasn't his stuff this is Nora's, I asked if he took  this bracelet behind her back and he said no, Nora gave it to him so he could give it to their daughter once she's 20 in case something happens to Nora. I don't know why but I didn't believe him, I told him I would call Nora to ask her but he started yelling at me to stay out of his family business. We started arguing and I kept demanding he tell me how and why he got this bracelet. he refused to say anything first, then he admitted going into Nora's room and taking it while she was out. I told him thus wasn't okay but he said this was his right after he spent money on her treatment before but never got his money back. I was shocked by this statement, they were married back then and he shouldn't expect to be repaid. I got mad and told him he has 1 day to return the bracelet or I'll tell Nora and let her involve the authorities if she had to cause the bracelet looked heavy and pricey. He begged me to stay out of it but I refused. He said I was being malicious and should side with him not threaten him but I refused to negotiate anything, and I'm responsible for my word now. Nora is a decent woman who's struggling and I feel like she should know she can't trust her own daughter's father in her home after this.

AITA for dumping the truth on my sister?,"My parents had two girls me (17f) and my sister (14f). I have always felt like my parents saw me as a babysitter, as a third adult in the house, and have expected me to be a 40 year old kid/teenager. Whereas my sister was their baby. They spoil her rotten. They adore her. She has never wanted for anything and they do everything to make her happy.

I was expected to help take care of my sister for as long as I can remember. She's not special needs, was never sick, wasn't even a preemie either. But that was the dynamic that was set up. I remember I would come home from school and mom would have me help feed my sister. She would have me watch her then while she was in and out of the house. I would be told I needed to play with her if my sister was upset. She'd miss me a lot and my parents would insist I dedicate my time to her once I was home. We'd go out as a family and she'd want something and they'd get it for her. But I would be told to act my age if I wanted something. She would get to hang out with friends whenever she wanted, would have really amazing birthday parties and sleepovers that I was never allowed to have. I also never got to attend sleepovers at other friends houses. There were times my parents would take her to do really amazing stuff and I was left behind.

Over time my sister started to get annoyed by my pulling back when I was around 15. I kept to myself, I'm moody around them, I don't engage in the ""family"", I take the punishments rather than do chores since she has none assigned to her. My parents hate that I won't be the little house keeper they wanted. My sister has told me I'm a brat and ungrateful for not helping our parents who are amazing. Over time it has gotten worse.

Then she heard me making plans to leave with my friends in a couple of months. She was so pissed that I was going to leave the family behind and that I hadn't told the family anything. She talked about how mom and dad have saved for us to go to college and I just wanna run away. Something broke inside me when she said that. I told her SHE has a college fund waiting for her, but I don't. Just like SHE can get anything she wants while I'm told to act my age and not want anything. I told her she expects me to be a maid when I get nothing and she gets everything. I told her I am not that much older than her but everyone expects me to be an adult. I asked her how she'd feel if she was supposed to juggle a younger sibling, taking care of the bulk of household chores, schoolwork and not getting time with friends. That the only reason you have shit is because you work, but it leaves you exhausted because you already have so much on. I told her that is my life and she doesn't make me want to stay any more than our parents do.

To cut this short she's upset and I was called an asshole for being so mean to her. My sister said I was an asshole for dumping all that on her shoulders.

AITA?",21862,xxx7ah,"> I was called an asshole for being so mean to her

There is a difference between being mean and being honest at a breaking point. You didn't call her names. You didn't say things to insult her. All you did was tell her how you've felt all these years.

If her response to being told that *you* have had nothing your whole life while she had everything is to call you ""mean"" she is too far gone. Maybe later in life she'll see what was happening and may try to make amends and you can have a sister. But right now you have two bosses and a client.

AITA for showing my husband proof that his mom offered to bring him steak dish to the hospital?,"My husband was in a car accident last week. He was staying at the hospital for his broken leg. Only me and his mom were there. His mom and I don't get along AT ALL. he tells me I'm overreacting or paranoid whenever I point out how she's mistreating me.

He complained about hospital food saying it had no taste and asked me to make his favorite meal which's steack dish and bring it to him at the hospital. Noting that steak isn't cheap where we live and I didn't have enough time to prepare it. I told him I will see what I can do then his mom said if I'm truly a supportive wife then I'd make it happen.

Once we went outside his room, His mom's tone changed. She suddenly seemed nice and said that she could see how exhausted I was and so I should go home and not worry about the steak dish because she said she'd make it for him. I asked if she was 100% sure and she said ""absoluetly!!"".

The next visit I showed up and my husband asked why I didn't bring the steak dish he asked for. I saw his mom there I told him his mom offered to make it for him instesd and told me not to worry about it. He didn't believe and was like ""mom said that? I'm not buying it, mom you really said that?"" her reaction shocked me. She acted confused and said that I'm his wife and she didn't know why I'd expect her to ""perform"" my duties for me. I was confused and didn't know what to do. My husband seemed upset the entire visit and I waited til his mom left to talk.

I swore to him his mom said she'd take care of it but he said he didn't believe me. I pulled my phone out, called his mom and put her on speaker so he could hear the conversation. I said ""didn't you say you'd make the steak dish and that I didn't have to worry about it?"" she relied ""I did...but I obviously wasn't actually going to do it, I was just trying to help my son see how his wife is during the rough times and you took the bait"". My husband raised his eyebrows. He got pissed he called her later and picked a fight then said no more visiting.

AITA for flipping out on my husband for cancelling my job interview?,"new account because he deleted my main.


So, this might sound petty but let me explain.

In 2019 I could no longer work because of my physical disabilities. no company wanted to hire me for the past couple of years and My husband said that it's better I just stay home and not worry about working. I agreed and he's become the breadwinner, then... it's like a switch that flipped because chores were 50/50 but after I lost my job they become 100% on me (keep in mind my physical disabilities I developed). his excuse for not doing anything to help is that I stay at home 24.7, I told him that's not fair especially since I suffered from physical discomfort. he made a deal with me and promised that everything will be 50/50 once I start working again. I told him I would find a job and he laughed and said ""good luck"" (I remember this vividly because of the strange laugh that I never heard him laugh before)


I started looking for a job again for months but had no luck til my friend's husband found me a potential job at a company that would have me wfh due to physical strains. I was so excited and felt like I'm capable again despite the struggle, they scheduled an interview with me and when I told my husband he looked red in the face but said nothing.

2 days ago I found out that my job interview got cancelled, I found out when my friend reached out to ask why I did that but I said I had no Idea. I checked my email and found nothing because I didn't send anything to the company. My husband came home and admitted cancelling the interview. I asked why and he said that ""this job had lots of requirments and I didn't seem fit to be accepted there so to spare me the heartache of being rejected, he just cancelled the interview"". I flipped out on him and told him he destroyed my one and only chance at landing a job. but he said he was just feeling concerned about my wellbeing, I told him he probably didn't want me to work cause he didn't want to split house chores and he seemed offended by that. He threw a fit about how unreasonable and selfish I was to even consider a job without speaking to him first. I told him I don't get involved in his work life. He called me horrible for accusing him of bad intention then went out to meet his friends probably to vent because one of them told me that my husband is looking out for me but I was being cruel to him by yelling.


he has been cold shouldering me since then, deleted my social media accounts claiming that they're bad for my mental health because of the negative affect some of those platforms have.

OP I know that there are enough comments asking to leave this abusive behavior, so I won't echo.

But PLEASE message me privately and I will see if I can help you restore your social media accounts. 

Most place like FB still archive them for a certain amount of days and there are multiple ways to recover them. I work in IT and can try to help you get them back & protected so he can't do it again. No charge. 

I have been victim of isolating Narcissistic abuse & almost guarantee there is a chance that they're not permanently deleted and he has just changed them/unplublished them so you can't access them so he can use them against you in the future. That way he could send messages as ""you"" or make posts that make you look mentally unstable in efforts to control the narrative. 

Please let me help you try to get those accounts back before it's too late or help you build new ones that he can't access. I'll even set an email up under my .com domain  so even if he gets access, we could still get you back in, if needed.


EDIT: OP I will also help you set up a professional email and a VOIP number for job search so that you can continue your job search without a chance of him interfering in the future. That way you can have a separate account that he can't access.

AITA for telling my husband I won't cook for him again if he chose to eat his coworker's meal over mine.,"


Hear me out.

My husband (Jesse, 31) has been bringing home meals that his female coworker (Nelly) cook for him. Now I'm not the best cook and Jesse's made it clear but he still eats what I cook everyday.

What I noticed with Nelly was that she tends to take every opportunity to point out how weak and taseless my cooking is. Jesse would say nothing except steer the conversation towards something else they both relate too while I'm sitting there wallowing in my misery thinking about what she said..(also she once asked what was another chore I was good at and Jesse said ironing his suits, she in response joked about having him send her a suit of his so he could see how good she is at ironing *too*. I rolled my eyes hard but at least Jesse agreed that was weird)




Last week.....Jesse came home with a new meal she cooked. I told him I already cooked dinner and asked what he was going to do with the meal. He told me he was going to eat it for dinner. Ngl I was getting a bit irritated and he must've had noticed because he said he promised Nelly he'd eat her for dinner, and that she asked him to take a pic of the ""empty plate"" later to confirm that he'd actually eaten it. I was baffled....like completely baffled at this. I told him one thing and one thing only, told him that if he chose to eat Nelly's meal over the dinner I cooked then THIS would be the LAST time I cook for him. He started moaning about how I was being unfair and putting him in a rough place. He stalled and didn't give a clear answer til I saw him walk past me later when I set the table and prepared dinner. And put her meal in the microwave. I felt so awful, I almost cried. I then told him that from now on out I won't cook for him anymore since he made his choice. I obviously pissed him off because he went off on me calling me childish and pathetic to make this about my ""ego"". I got up from my chair and told him I owed him NOTHING and that he made his decision and so did I.


He snapped and said that this was ridiculos and that Nelly......was just doing a nice thing for him whileas my behavior was disgraceful and *disgusting*.

He then went into the bedroom and I rushed after him but he shouted *""LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE""*  then proceeded to shut the door and hasn't been speaking to me after that.


His mom knew about the argument and called begging me to be more patient and not make any decisions I might regret later. She agreed that Nelly was overstepping  and firmly believes she's the problem and so I shouldn't be hard on her son. But Mil is incredibly biased, meaning in her eyes, her son is a saint who can do no wrong. So that's that.

I feel like I overreacted and really messed it up when I pushed him like that.",21727,upg3aq,"Your problems are greater than a meal. Nelly sounds like she has designs on your husband.

You two need to sit down and have a serious talk about her. He *may* have a blind eye to her intents and intentions, but I really doubt it. Either way, he needs to know that what she's doing, and his accepting of what she's doing, is not okay. It's highly disrespectful to both you and your marriage.

AITA for asking my aunt what part of the penis was required to operate a toy?,"So I (26F) am expecting my first daughter with my husband (29M) in September. I grew up in a moderately religious household with pretty strictly defined gender roles. As in, since I was a girl, I had chores around the house while my younger brother did not have to do anything. 

I don't talk to my parents for a variety of reasons (going on year 5 now) so they do not know I am pregnant. Both my aunts and grandparents were very supportive of me leaving my household and as such have been my main family. Being 6 months pregnant now, people have started to give gifts and I am very grateful for them. 

We have decided that we don't want our daughter to be surrounded by pink everything with only girl things. So we have made a conscious effort to include traditionally 'boy' outfits and toys like dinosaurs and cars. We have told people that any gender items would be accepted and if it's getting too much 'pink' we have gone out to balance a bit (getting a green jacket or something). My younger aunt  has taken great offense to this because 'boys are boys and girls are girls'. And she is a very verbal and loud person and has let us know several times her opinions. She has two boys. 

 At my baby shower my older aunt gifted us a book called 'goodnight construction site' and a little stuffed truck. My younger aunt went on a tirade about how we are somehow making our daughter trans and not allowing her to be a girl. And she's a loud person so of course her saying this was more like a yell, and in front of my VERY liberal in-laws who are very supportive of our choice. 

Pregnancy hormones took over and I grabbed the toy, gave it to my younger aunt and asked her what part of the penis was needed to operate this toy truck. She yelled that's not what she meant and left. The rest of the baby shower went fine but it was a bit awkward after. Since then she has been blowing up Facebook where a bunch of people agree with her that I am making my daughter trans and have been telling me that I was an asshole. The rest of my think what we are doing is fine, but that I shouldn't have handled it that way. 

So was I an asshole?

Edited to add: wow this really blew up, I was not anticipating this much response. To answer some questions: I do not care if she ends up loving pink and unicorns etc, we will get her them then. I just was trying to balance out the sheer amount of pink items we were getting from friends and family. Almost every single gift has been heavily pink or girl influenced. To the point where she would not be dressed in anything but pink if we did not go out and buy some more boy things. I also am generally not a person who argues. But I feel like a bit of an Ahole because I intentionally said this as deadpan serious as I could and with the intent to embarrass her in front of our family members present.  My delivery and question did have the intended effect and she went quite red before leaving. 

This was also the first transphobic comment I've ever heard out of her mouth. While we all grew up quite conservative, my older aunt coming out 27 years ago really changed my family's perspective. My grandparents have changed from what they previously viewed and my aunt was always supportive of my other aunt. My younger aunt always wanted a girl, so I thought she was just trying to act out her fantasy girl with all her gifts and preferences.",21708,v1192n,"That’s ridiculous. My 3 year old niece plays with dinosaurs and trucks, all while possessing a wardrobe that would put Elle from Legally Blonde to shame with the amount of pink.

AITA for telling my sister I hope she never has kids?,"I'm 22f. I have 3yo twin boys and I had a baby girl not even two days ago. My sister, Jodie, is 34 and has been suffering with infertility for the past 10 years, as well as repeated miscarriages. I used to feel really bad for her and also a bit guilty as I got pregnant twice while being on contraception. It caused some tension between us when I was pregnant with my twins because she was jealous, and I was already feeling intense guilt. This time around, she wasn't as jealous but I still felt it was unfair. 

As my husband and I have decided we are done having kids, I offered to be a surrogate for my sister as soon as I'm cleared after this baby and she seemed like she was absolutely over the moon with that. In turn, she offered to watch the twins while I was in labour with my new baby, which was a relief on my part. 

I went into labour on Thursday morning, and Jodie came over to watch the kids while my husband and I went to the hospital. She seemed like she was in a great mood, and promptly rushed us out the door. 

Everything seemed fine, until we got home this morning to find thousands worth of destruction to pretty much every baby item we've purchased. Even the crib mattress was torn open. Everything was ruined. Jodie tried to pin it on the twins but they're 3, and this level of destruction had to have been done by an adult. My twins can't even reach some of the stuff that was destroyed, and they certainly do not know how to open diaper packages and tear them apart. I know kids, especially toddlers, can do a lot of damage in a short time but I also know my children aren't capable of doing what happened. 

I told my sister to get the fuck out of my home and stay away from me and my family. I got really angry, and I said a lot of stuff I shouldn't have, but one of them was, ""I hope you never have a child, and if you do then I'll tell it exactly what you've done to mine.""  I told her we can't afford to fix the damage she's caused but since she still denies it, she wont cough up. I told her because of her the baby doesn't even have a safe space to sleep.

My parents caught wind of what I said, and even after I explained the situation, they still think I'm being an asshole for saying something so vile to my sister ""after all she's done for us"". Obviously my judgement is clouded , so am I an asshole?",21706,x6mhr7,"NTA.  You might want to call the police and at least get a report filed for the destruction of property if it isn't too late.

AITA for what I told my mother In Law when she asked to be in the delivery room?,"My husband (m33) & I (f30) are expecting a baby boy, We're barely catching up with preperation and getting everything ready. His mom (kind of a busy body type but can be helpful at times) invited us for dinner and said she has an important request to make.


She brought her request up at dinner table and blatantly said that she wanted to be in the delivery room with me when I give birth. I was taken back by her request -- I really thought it had something to do with the nursery or diaper brand. I said I was sorry but only my mom and my husband will be there. She made a face, got quiet for a while then brought it up again. just kept pushing saying she is as much of a grandmother as my mom and that she just wanted to be there for support and get the opportunity to see her grandbaby's first moments. my husband sided with her.

I just stared at her and said ""it's alright, you can have the opportunity to be in the delivery room when it's your son who's giving birth"". everyone stopped eating and my mother in law left the table in an instance. My husband had me got up although I wasn't finish with dinner but he said we should leave.


In the car, he lost it on me asking ""what brain cell"" made me think it was a good idea to tell his mom that. I told him his mom kept pushing after I'd already given her an answer. still he said this was the most fucked up shit he heard me say. I replied that I was just frustrated and didn't mean to hurt her feelings and cause issues. he argued that if I don't want issues then I should stop making shit difficult and just say yes to his mom's request. he then ranted about how it's his son too and then said if his mom isn't allowed in there then he won't be there too. now I don't know if he really meant this or just said it in the hear of the moment but it had me fuming.

AITA for using my husband's money to pay for my daughter's Apple IPhone that he broke?,"

My daughter is 16. She had her old phone for 5 years and always wanted a new phone, I'm the only one working right now since my husband decided to take ""a break"" from work after he inherited some money from his dad.


I saw that she did pretty good at school despite having mental health issues that had gotten in the way of her focus before and so I decided to keep her encouraged and reward her by getting her an apple iPhone that cost a good sum of money. I did my best to save money to buy it, I literally skipped paying for breakfast at work to be able to afford it, and my husband didn't want to help so I was on my own.


I bought her the iPhone and quite honestly, I haven't seen her this happy in a while, it was refreshing for me because she really went through some hard time in the past couple of years emotionally and mentally.


My husband wasn't happy with this he said the iPhone will only distract her from school and chores but that wasn't true, in fact it encouraged her to do more. But he still said I shouldn't have spent that kind of money on an iPhone that she might be irresponsible with and break. My daughter picked up on his attitude towards the iPhone but I told her to ignore him.


Days ago, I found out that he broke the iPhone, I asked why and he said he asked her to get him something from the toolbox in the garage but she was on the iPhone and ignored him. He used this incident as evidence that the iPhone was bad influence but I yelled at him and demanded he replace it, he said he wouldn't so I took money out of his account and paid for a new iPhone and gave it to my daughter. He saw what I did and went off  on me calling me vicious and awful and accused me of stealing his father's money and demanded the money I took, every single penny back. I basically told him it won't happen, he got his mother on me saying I'm setting a terrible example for my daughter by getting her a phone paid for with money that I stole from her dad. My husband said he won't speak a word to me til I fix this but I already said I owe him nothing.


aita for this?

ETA: No, he's her biological father, not stepdad. And price for the iPhone where I live is a thousand dollars and its not cheap. Finding out that I took a thousand dollars out of his inheritance really got him so furious that he said I was the worst woman he met in his life (he had 2 ex wifes if this is in any way relevant) he took it back later then said he won't speak til the money is back.",21695,txq9di,NTA.

AITA for taking the cake I baked for my fiance's birthday and going home?,"
Me f25 and fiance m31 'Ben''s mom don't have the best relationship. I try my best to be polite around her but she's the type that'd have high standards/expectations of whoever dates her son's (she has 3). She's commented on my hair and body several times and at some point suggested ""cosmetic"" surgeries for the future. This upsets me but Ben tells me this is who she is and I need to learn to have a thick skin since often times, she doesn't really mean to be malicious.


Anyways, I'm known for baking cakes and sweets. Ben eats what I make but whenever I bring something to his family to try they find every excuse in the world not to eat it. I'm OK with that and stopped doing it.

For Ben's 31st birthday, his mom wanted to host the party. I decided to bake him his birthday cake and he was thrilled with it. I went grocery shopping, took time off work and put so much effort into making it how he likes it. I took it with me to his mom's house and to my surprise when I walked in I saw a large birthday cake sitting at the dinning table. I was puzzled, FMIL said she requested this cake from the bakery and paid xxx money for it. I asked ""what about the cake I've  made?"". She responded ""oh you can place it on the counter over there and we'll let the kids have it"". This felt like ice was dropped all over me, I looked at Ben and he nodded at me in a ""just do it"" way. I was so mad and the cake was still in my hands at the time. I turned around and made my way to the door. His mom remained standing but Ben followed me asking where I was going. I told him that he didn't need my cake and by extention me since my efforts were so easily dismissed and disrespected. He said i was overreacting and that his mom paid so much for that cake and it was only fair that he accept it. He begged me to get back inside and do him this favor by basically just go with the flow but I decided to go home. He got mad and started saying I was being unreasonable and stirring drama over nothing.


I went home and he didn't get back til 11 PM. He was so upset he said he and his family didn't appreciate the childish behavior I displayed and ruining his party and disrespecting his mom like that. Said I turned this into a huge deal and should've acted more maturelly instead of walking out with the cake.

AITA for wearing white to my wedding?,"I recently got married to the love of my life, J. We had a perfect wedding, except for one thing, my MIL's freakout when she saw my dress. When we had gone dress shopping, I invited her and I found my perfect dress. 

My husbands family has a tradition of always wearing blush dresses on their wedding day. They told me about this before, and I respectfully said I would wear whatever color dress my perfect dress was. Once I finally found it, it was white. MIL asked me to ask if they could alter it to make it blush, or to find a new dress if they couldn't. I said I would ask, but if they couldn't then that was that.

Long story short, they couldn't and I showed up to my wedding in a white dress. All through the ceremony MIL was seething. During the reception, she pulled me aside and asked why my dress was white. I told her that I didn't want to find a new dress and they couldn't alter it. She said it was a tradition, and she was disappointed that I had broke it. J also said that he was disappointed when I walked down the aisle in a white dress.

AITA for forcing my husband to pay for my daughter's piano after he damaged it?,"My husband & I have been together for 2 an a half years. I have a daughter ""Callie"", she's 13, she loves instrumental music and piano has been her #1 interest. I'm not saying this because she's my daughter but really, I see her talent as special and more importantly...she uses it to express her feelings especially for her deceased father who passed away when she was 7. She always says that she, in a way connects to him through playing piano. So I encouraged her to do more and her grandparents bought her a 6000 thousand piano that she was so thrilled with.

The whole family encourages her but my husband thinks she's being distracted from school, real future etc. He doesn't attend her plays, doesn't help with the academy, doesn't even take the time to listen to her playing and everytime he comes home and hears her playing upstairs, he'd lecture us about how this activity is just a waste of time. I sat him down and told him about Callie picking up on that bad vibe, he got mad and said that he was doing my job for me and ensuring she doesn't get distracted from school although her grades are good.

We went back an forth on this and I made it clear that this should stop. He said okay and that was the end of it.

On Sunday a huge argument ensued in the house because my husband claimed Callie woke him up on his day off with her loud playing. He issued an ultimatuim, either the piano goes or he gets rid of it himself. I asked where should I take it? He said Callie's grandparents house but Callie didn't want to. After we left I found out that my husband took it to the junk yard his dad works at and cut it into pieces. A big argument ensued and we literally had a screaming match infront of his family over this. I gave him 2 days to pay for a new one despite him apologizing and saying he acted in a moment of desperation and frustration. He said the only way he could pay for it is using his savings that was supposed to go towards his new Garage as a side business. He complained about me forcing him to pay and ruining his business before it even starts. 


He kept sending his family as middle-men to get me to give him at least 4 months but I refused and stood my ground despite being called unreasonable since it's a piano vs new business. 


AITA for forcing him to pay and not giving him time?

EDIT ~~ No, he didn't have an issue with whatever Callie was doing at first til we started living together. At first I thought that as a family we tend to get annoyed by stuff other family members do but apparently...this is not the case. By the way tonight or tomorrow morning is the timeline I've given him and so far I haven't heard from him or his dad.",21644,vmn00z,">  everytime he comes home snd hears her playing upstairs he'd lecture us about how this activity is just a waste of time.

There's research showing that playing a musical instrument is good for you in a bunch of ways. 

IDK if he's jealous because it's a connection with her deceased father, but that's really not a good look.

> On Sunday a huge argument ensued in the house because my husband claimed Callie woke him up on his day off with her loud playing. He issued an ultimatuim, either the piano goes or he gets rid of it himself.

Yeah, because that's reasonable. Not ""no playing before noon on the weekends.""

There's also a third option, here: he goes.

>  After we left I found out that my husband took it to the junk yard his dad works at and cut it into pieces.

Oh my god. It's the third option: He has to go.

That's completely unacceptable. He destroyed something valuable that she loves for god-knows-what reason.

My granddad however hated that my parents taught us this way and as I got older I did too. Because of this I became very close with my grandparents instead of my own parents. I also have an older brother that my parents labeled “ the second king of the house”. For more info( important) my grandparents lived in a beautiful house that had no neighbors, many trees, and a garden. They payed off the house after years and was very special to them. My granddad also had bad problems with his back and a condition that would get worse until he couldn’t go on anymore. After my grandmother passed he got worse and ended up needing at home care. He didn’t want a stranger in his home so that wasn’t an option ( I think it was due to my grandmother passing). My parents preached that it was punishment for all his sins so they wouldn’t take care of him and were planning on putting him in a home. I decided to stay with him since it would just be easier, my job can be worked effectively at home and he’d get care from someone who isn’t a total stranger. In the time I took care of him we filled the home with the love and laughter my grandmother brought to it. As my granddad got worse not a single call. Not from my mom, or dad, or my brother. We were joking about it once and he said “ maybe I should just give you missy( the houses name lol) instead of your dad, he’s just gonna give it to your brother anyway” he laughed after he said that so I assumed he was joking. Fast forward, the worst happened. I was the one who found him. Had to make the call. All of it. As much as I was pushed away from my parents I didn’t want them to find out the news from a random person. The funeral was the first time I ever truly connected with my parents in years. We hugged and cried together and we were all vulnerable. But then it came time for the will. Now it wasn’t some telenovela with all the dramatics but it was intense. The house that was supposed to be my dad’s became mine as well as many other things that my dad planned on giving to my brother. I was accused of manipulating my granddad into giving it to me and my brother was just yelling. A week after my brother came to the house in tears. He was begging me to give him the house since his was too small for his wife and baby. He argued that because it’s just me and my husband and we don’t want kids I don’t need it. I told him to leave and felt horrible. I feel like an asshole and so does my family. He’s right I don’t need the house, my job pays me good money and I could easily just live somewhere else. On the other hand though my granddad wouldn’t want him OR my dad to have it. I am at a loss here. AITA?",21585,ueremu,"As my granddad got worse not a single call.

Hey OP I currently work as a hospice nurse... please don't give your family an inch. They couldn't give your grandfather a five minute phone call while he was alive but they think they are entitled to his home?

AITA for refusing to turn my son's room into a nursery for my grandson?,"

My daughter Avery (24) and her husband Tom (29) are expecting their first baby together, They're both very excited and been getting so many things done in a short time. Because they've been busy lately we haven't seen them in 2 months.


Yesterday they visited me at the house to talk about the baby mostly. Tom asked me if I had emptied one of the rooms so I could turn it into a nursery yet, I was confused by his question and asked him why. He said that he expected me to, I asked why again, he looked at me and said that every decent grandmother prepares a nursery at her home specifically to welcome her grandson as a new member of the extended family. Then went on to give examples of how common this tradition is. I don't know why but his words irked me. I asked why can't his mom prepare one for her grandson since this is her grandson too, He laughed and said that his mom already has one prepared that she paid for herself. I have to mention Tom's family is well off unlike us, we don't have an avaliable room or money to afford a whole nursery, yet, Tom insisted it's necesary and that I make efforts to make sure my grandson gets everything he needs whenever they visit. I looked at my daughter wondering if she agreed with this and by the looks of it, she did.


I told Tom that I don't have the space or money to make this happen but he argued that not making this happen will affect how many visits I get compared to his mom who's fully prepared and ""considerate"" of her grandbaby's needs. Avery finally spoke up but told me to please try to move my 16 yo son to stay with his 14 yo brother. I said no the boys are old enough to get their own room but Tom pitched in saying boys can share a room since they're boys but I wasn't convinced. In fact, I was upset they came up with this suggestion. Avery didn't like that and took it as in I don't care about her baby and don't want to do anything for him but that is just not true. The conversation turned into an argument and they left minutes later.

Avery must've called my husband because he yelled at me when he came home saying this was no way to treat my daughter and our grandchild, I told him the story and he accused me of favoring the boys over Avery like I always do but this time I just don't think her request is in any way reasonable.

Edit. One thing to clarify and that is I never said this was common, it is not unless you have a well off family that is why I think Tom said his family consider this normal.

Tom offered to pay for everything and all I have to do is empty my son's room. I said no and the argument started again with Tom saying I'm refusing to work with them on a compromise, but this is not a compromise to me.",21503,sa0zl8,NTA - is this some cultural thing?!!

AITA: for my response when my boyfriend brought up the apartment purchaee/ownership infront of his family?,"


Context: I (F29) have been with my boyfriend Adam (M27) for 2 and a half years. He's the quiet/shy type. It's very hard to get him to open up about what bothers him. For now I'm the one with an income. 

We get along easily though he can be...a bit unreasonable sometimes.e.g he doesn't cook cause he's worried I won't like his food but still cooks for himself and the smell's pretty telling that he's cooking is good. Another e,g and that is he doesn't do most chores saying he's worried he might break/damage something. It's frustrating but we're working on fixing it. 

Now unto the more complicated issue... I'd put money aside since 2015 to buy an apartment and I'm finally able to get it done this year. When I told him this he got agitated and said I should wait a little longer til we're married, but I said no. He started complaining about how bad he feels about seeing me buy the apartment myself without having him contribute. I asked what I was supposed to do because...it kinda sounded like a ""he problem"" no offense but... he got so worked up and gave me 2 options...1. is I put his name on the title, 2. is not buy the apartment til marriage so it'll become ""shared marital asset"". I said no and that was final and he should drop it. He did eventually. 

At his family's house, I was taken aback when he started complaining about the apartment and again told me to either put his name on the title or wait til marriage to buy it, cause he feels like there's a ""huge power imbalance"" here, and that he can't bring himself to accept it. He also said that it makes him feel like he contributes nothing. I snapped and said ""the reason you feel like you contribute nothing is because you literally contribute nothing and I suggest you fix that by actually finding a job and having a decent income"". His family looked shocked, he glanced at me then got up and walked away. I waited for him to come back but had to go home cause his mom said he felt too overwhelmed and wanted some space. She then basically started shaming for my ""statement"" and hinted about financial abuse and control over her son. He's not home yet demanding another tall about the apartment probably expecting me to agree to one option.

edit in case it matters: He has a disability that limits his job opportunities.",21484,w9c19e,"NTA.

First off, look up weaponized incompetence. Your BF is manipulating you into managing anything he views as inconvenient.

As for this particular event, your boyfriend gathered people he suspected would be on his side and ambushed you in a convo that you already had and ended, and then has the audacity to complain about power balances? Is there anything this man does that isn't manipulative?

Keep moving forward with your life, and don't hesitate to leave him by the wayside as you do.

AITA for ruining my wife's work and eating the food before she could take pictures of it?,"
My wife runs a website dedicated for cooking and recipes. She takes pictures of food before we eat wether it's lunch or dinner and post them on her insta account. to be honest, I'm annoyed by having to wait so long for her to ""get the perfeft shot"" of the food after decorating it, adding this fork and removing that salad dish. It just takes so long and I lose my appetite from just waiting til she's done. This has become the norm but yesterday, I decided I was having none of it.


I came to found that she has cooked an entire feast as her ""next cooking project"" and put it on the table. Note that by lokking at the whole table setting, I figured pictures had already been taken, right? but no, she said she was gOiNg to take few pictures and I had to wait. She went upstairs to get her camera that's when I grabbed the spoon and started filling my plate from every dish she's made and ""ruining"" the look as a result. I was hungry and unwilling to wait around for 10+ to eat.


She came downstairs, saw the ""damage"" and blew up almost crying saying I just ruined her cooking project that she worked hours for as well as putting efforts into. I said I was hungry and couldn't wait but she kept yelling how much of an obnoxious jerk I was for not waiting til dhe took pictures of the dishes she made, Even said that this was an AttEmPt of me to ""Sabotage"" her success. I said ""oh please enough with those conspiracy theories, I'm just hungry and couldn't wait til she got the perfect shot"". We had a big argument and shewent upstairs crying. I finished my food then went out to cool off a bit.


When I returned she'd threatened that she'll never have me eat anything she cooks and said she'd rather throw it in the garbage then give it to a ungrateful, obnoxious jerk like me. I said this wasn't cool but she told me to go fuck myself. I said fine then went to spend the night in the guests room. she texted me the word ""jerk"" about 15 times til I turned my phone off.

Today she has gone complete radio silence. AITA?",21484,spgbvp,"YTA.

Let’s break this down:
 1) THIS IS HER JOB. She’s not making this food and making you wait to take pictures for funsies. She spent hours planning this, preparing this, and was ready to finish and you came home to ruin her work? How would you feel if she went to your workplace and destroyed a project because she was “annoyed” she had to wait a MERE ten minutes?

2) Your lack of respect for wife is appalling. This is your wife. This is her job. You’re making fun of her a getting annoyed because she wants to contribute to the family income?

3) If this is a pattern — her preparing food and requesting you wait so she can photograph it — eat a snack and be patient. Stop acting shocked that she’s going to do this. If you’re “starving” then get some fruit snacks and a juice box and wait for her to finish. Act like a toddler, snack like a toddler. Better yet, cook your own damn food!

Edit:
Even if she was doing for funsies, it doesn’t give OP any right to do what he did! I was just focusing on the job aspect of it because even though it’s something that DOES pay the bills, he still disrespects her. I’d imagine if she was just doing this for a hobby he would have just thrown the food directly at her face like a toddler.",7204,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/spgbvp/aita_for_ruining_my_wifes_work_and_eating_the/,"['wife', 'runs', 'website', 'dedicated', 'cooking', 'recipes', 'takes', 'pictures', 'food', 'before', 'eat', 'wether', 'its', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'post', 'insta', 'account', 'honest', 'im', 'annoyed', 'having', 'wait', 'long', 'get', 'perfeft', 'shot', 'food', 'decorating', 'adding', 'this', 'fork', 'removing', 'salad', 'dish', 'takes', 'long', 'lose', 'appetite', 'waiting', 'til', 'shes', 'done', 'this', 'has', 'become', 'norm', 'yesterday', 'decided', 'was', 'having', 'none', 'came', 'found', 'has', 'cooked', 'entire', 'feast', 'next', 'cooking', 'project', 'put', 'table', 'note', 'lokking', 'whole', 'table', 'setting', 'figured', 'pictures', 'already', 'taken', 'right', 'said', 'was', 'going', 'take', 'pictures', 'wait', 'went', 'upstairs', 'get', 'camera', 'thats', 'grabbed', 'spoon', 'started', 'filling', 'plate', 'every', 'dish', 'shes', 'made', 'ruining', 'look', 'result', 'was', 'hungry', 'unwilling', 'wait', 'around', '+', 'eat', 'came', 'downstairs', 'saw', 'damage', 'blew', 'almost', 'crying', 'saying', 'ruined', 'cooking', 'project', 'worked', 'hours', 'well', 'putting', 'efforts', 'said', 'was', 'hungry', 'wait', 'kept', 'yelling', 'much', 'obnoxious', 'jerk', 'was', 'waiting', 'til', 'dhe', 'took', 'pictures', 'dishes', 'made', 'even', 'said', 'this', 'was', 'attempt', 'sabotage', 'success', 'said', 'oh', 'please', 'enough', 'conspiracy', 'theories', 'im', 'hungry', 'wait', 'til', 'got', 'perfect', 'shot', 'big', 'argument', 'shewent', 'upstairs', 'crying', 'finished', 'food', 'went', 'cool', 'bit', 'returned', 'shed', 'threatened', 'shell', 'never', 'eat', 'anything', 'cooks', 'said', 'shed', 'rather', 'throw', 'garbage', 'give', 'ungrateful', 'obnoxious', 'jerk', 'like', 'said', 'this', 'cool', 'told', 'go', 'fuck', 'said', 'fine', 'went', 'spend', 'night', 'guests', 'room', 'texted', 'word', 'jerk', 'times', 'til', 'turned', 'phone', 'today', 'has', 'gone', 'complete', 'radio', 'silence', 'aita']",wife runs website dedicated cooking recipes takes pictures food before eat wether its lunch dinner post insta account honest im annoyed having wait long get perfeft shot food decorating adding this fork removing salad dish takes long lose appetite waiting til shes done this has become norm yesterday decided was having none came found has cooked entire feast next cooking project put table note lokking whole table setting figured pictures already taken right said was going take pictures wait went upstairs get camera thats grabbed spoon started filling plate every dish shes made ruining look result was hungry unwilling wait around + eat came downstairs saw damage blew almost crying saying ruined cooking project worked hours well putting efforts said was hungry wait kept yelling much obnoxious jerk was waiting til dhe took pictures dishes made even said this was attempt sabotage success said oh please enough conspiracy theories im hungry wait til got perfect shot big argument shewent upstairs crying finished food went cool bit returned shed threatened shell never eat anything cooks said shed rather throw garbage give ungrateful obnoxious jerk like said this cool told go fuck said fine went spend night guests room texted word jerk times til turned phone today has gone complete radio silence aita 
AITA for calling my sister’s husband a piece of shit because he’s representing my ex in our divorce?,"I asked my ex for a divorce two months ago and I found out a week later that my sister’s husband was going to be his solicitor. I wasn’t completely surprised as my ex has helped his career a lot but I was still hurt when my sister told me. 

I’ve avoided him since finding out but my parents invited everyone over for dinner and I missed them so I went. I tried really hard to bite my tongue but he kept referring to me as my ex’s wife and told me that if he was me, he would stay married because I was going to lose a lot if I divorced my ex. I ended up telling him he was a real piece of shit in front of everybody, including his daughters.

AITA for eating cake in my car so I didn't have to share with my wife and kids?,"I acknowledge, as a father and husband, that a lot of things that were singularly mine before just aren't.

AITA for calling out my sister for breastfeeding at my wedding?,"My (34m) sister gave birth 2 months ago. She brought the baby to mine and my wife's (23f) wedding.

She breastfeeds whenever she goes. We visit her house? She'll breastfeed in front of us. Visiting our parents? She'll breastfeed. Going out in a public setting? She'll sit on a bench on the park and breastfeed. Go out to a restaurant? She breastfeeds. Every where. I've never spoken on it because I know she'll get mad and offended but when she did that on my wedding I lost my cool.

During the reception dinner she just did it again. I kindly approached her and asked her why she didn't bring formula or at least bump milk out and put it in the bottle so she wouldn't have to do all this at that moment. She said ""because I don't have to. I feel comfortable breastfeeding. Getting milk out on my own is more painful"" I said she could just make this sacrifice and compromise for one day instead of doing this in front of 250 guests on my wedding. She then said she can't do much about it now, because the baby has to have her milk. I told her she should be more thoughtful of that then instead of completely embarrassing herself and us by doing this.

I told my wife what the deal was and she said I'm an AH and should immediately apologise to my sister. My parents also sided with my sister and now pretty much everyone thinks I'm an AH since I'm the only person who had a problem with it.

The only reason I decided to call her out is because I considered it a bad etiquette and tacky to do that at a formal event and that she could just find another solution for that night.

AITA for telling my mother in law my toddler will not be going with her on a vacation she planned without asking?,"I have an almost three year old beautiful little girl. She’s just a few weeks shy of her third birthday. My baby was out in hospice four weeks ago after having gone into remission late May. Unfortunately, the cancer has returned except it is now crushing her optic nerve and is about 8cm long. Multiple doctors recommended we make our daughter as comfortable as possible as they do not believe removing the tumor is a good option. I have so much to say in regards to her diagnosis but heartbroken will suffice for now.

My husband and I have been making tons of memories with her for the past few weeks. We’ve included family in some of these memories but we both feel that we want to spend as much time with our daughter as possible. My mother in law called me yesterday to tell me she booked tickets/hotel/airfare for a trip next month. I thought it sounded fun until she said she was taking our toddler with her. Just her, my daughter, and her husband. She did not invite my husband and I.

My daughter isn’t even three yet. She has never stayed overnight anywhere and mother in law wants to take her for one entire week across the country, alone. I suggested that my husband and I both go that way our daughter is comfortable and for gods sake in the event she dies? She can’t be gone for a week. Her nurses are here. Her care is here.

I suggested what if we all go for a shorter amount of time. I came up with various suggestions to which all were turned down. I should add that if my daughter was not in hospice I still would not be comfortable with our toddler being across the country for a week alone without her parents. My child being in hospice adds another layer of complexity to the situation. 

I told my mother in law that her decisions that she made alone without consulting us was a solid no. She called me a few names and hung up on me. She then called my husband and called me a few names and suggested she would fight for rights before my daughter dies. 

I’m already grieving. My husband said we should acquiesce to his mothers trip to avoid drama (even though he agrees that our daughter is too young). But I want to spend time with her before the cancer takes her, she’s too little etc. I said no for various reasons not just to say no.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who took the time to share their thoughts and insights. I appreciate the outpouring of messages and I’m sorry I haven’t had a chance to reply to them all.

I wanted to add a few things. My mother in law lives in the same county as us. In the same city as my parents. It’s only about a 20 minute drive without traffic. However, my in laws have always been very adamant that we visit them. So I usually take my daughter over every other week for a few hours for a visit. Rarely do they ever come to our home. My parents like to visit and always have. My daughter is much closer to my parents for this reason. Anytime my husband and I go to date nights my parents come over and watch her because they like for her to be in her comfort zone. This is before the cancer. Since the cancer diagnosis we’ve been in and out of the hospital for weeks at a time. My parents have still been very much involved with helping but I’m the form of dropping off meals, helping with laundry, etc. I’m very close to my family and my family has been very respectful of us needing space as a family during this time. I think my in laws may be expediting guilt because they haven’t made much of an effort yo visit us, see us, or accommodate us. It’s always about what I, their daughter in law can do for them. Have always felt like an incubator who’s just there to facilite a relationship between them and my child. 

Also, to add, I am set on distancing myself as much as I can. I’ve cut off contact with my mil and I do not want her around after this fiasco. I’ve completely blocked her from my phone and I communicated this to my husband. He is sad but says he understands. 

A few of you mentioned that this was an eye opening situation and it really has been. On many levels.


Second edit: I saw various commands about mother in law possibly wanting to taking my child on a trip to get her alternative treatment. Mother in law planned to take my child to Disney World in Florida which is across the country from where we live. Mother in law lives in the same state, in the same county as us. My husband and I have taken our child to Disneyland a few times in her life and most recently once. Going for one day was exhausting, and my daughter was spent after the day. I can’t imagine my daughter handling Disney world for more than a day but also I would like to be there for said trip. Even if my child wasn’t dying I would still not be comfortable with her going without me. It’s such a bizmare situation. Mother in law isn’t one for alternative treatments and I haven’t out right asked her but I wouldn’t be shocked at this point. Either way, my child isn’t going anywhere with her. Supervised or not. I’ve already made that clear to my husband. She wants to come and visit it will have to be at our home. Even then I’m still not on board after everything that has transpired. I’ve been thinking really deeply the last few months but even more so in the last 24 hours.  I don’t know how I can continue being part of this family. I’m trying not to think too far ahead but I’m seriously doubting continuing on in this marriage. Thank you again everyone.

Third edit: I am really close with my family, specifically my mom and aunt. They know the wishes I have for my daughter. My husband and I argued about where our daughter should be buried for a good week. It was awful. He wanted her buried with his grandma and where his parents and him will be buried. I wanted her buried at the cemetery my grandparents are buried at and where I plan to be buried at. My husband is in the military so I’m confused as to why he does not want to be buried with his combat brothers but that’s entirely up to him. After this fiasco with his mother I put my foot down about where I would like my daughters final resting place to be. I just never thought it would be so much back and forth about where she will get buried, the week long trip we weren’t invited on or consulted about, and acquiescing his mothers wishes. Shit show to say the least. I love my husband but I am appalled by his behavior. I should also add that my family was very supportive about where I wanted my daughter to be buried at when the topic came up. They even said wherever we want because it’s not their choice. I even entertained cremation just to try and come to a middle ground of sorts. I didn’t even want to discuss burials and cremations until I absolutely had to. I’ve been avoiding it. Now it feels morbid to discuss it because my daughter is still alive. My husbands family was upset when they brought the topic up. Because I didn’t automatically want my daughter at their cemetery of choice. Their main argument was that my daughter carries their last name so she should go there. My argument was my family already has four open plots and I want to make one a double for me to be when my time comes. I’m even exhausted writing this. Because this is my life and it shouldn’t be. We should be a team. United in grief. Now I feel like all I have is my baby and my family to hold me up.",21407,wiq2ef,"**NTA,** obviously.

I have so much to say about this, but most of it would get me banned.

What kind of grandmother would suggest taking her DYING TODDLER GRANDDAUGHTER WHO IS ALREADY IN HOSPICE away from the child's parents for even ONE of these final precious days in order to spend time with her, rather than suggesting spending that time together as a family (including grandma, I mean)?!!

Worse yet, what kind of grandmother would threaten to waste precious moments of your last days with your daughter with a COURT CASE that no sensible lawyer will even consider taking, it's so ridiculous? Visitation rights are one thing, but the idea that she has a right to take your child, who is currently in hospice, away on vacation for a week without you, across the country, is absolutely ludicrous. No such rights exist. And for her to even be talking about wasting your time, energy, focus, and money on a court case, whether it happens or not, is beyond obnoxious.

There would be absolutely nothing wrong with her wanting to spend time with her granddaughter, or, as you so lovingly suggested, wanting to do a short trip together as a family ... something that your daughter could physically handle, and that would be a special memory. But this? This selfish nonsense? As if a not-quite-3-year-old would even WANT to be apart from her Mummy and Daddy when she feels rotten and everything is confusing? As someone who has been chronically ill most of my life, I can assure you . . . the way your daughter is feeling these days, she doesn't want to be ANYWHERE without you, not even with her grandma. Mummy and Daddy are her comfort and safety. 

You are NTA. Stand your ground.

AITA for asking my husband to join us in my sister's birthday since he was in the same restaurant?,"
I f26 was invited to my sister's (18th) birthday few days ago at a restaurant. My husband didn't come because he said he had a meeting dinner with some clients. This made my family feel let down especially my sister who wanted him there and also her 18th birthday was a big deal to her obviously.



To my surprise, When I arrived I noticed that my husband was having his meeting at the same place, his table was right in the corner and he had about 4 men sitting with him. My parents and the guests saw him as well. I waved for him and he saw me but ignored me. He obviously was as much as surprised as I was.



My parents asked why he didn't even come to the table to acknowledge them after the cake arrived. I got up and walked up to his table. I stood there and said excuse me, my husband was silent when I asked (after I introduced myself to the clients) if he'd take few minutes to join me and the family in candle blowing and say happy birthday but he barely let out a phrase and said ""I don't think so, I'm busy right now"". I insisted saying it'd just take a couple of minutes and that it'd mean so much to my sister. He stared at me then stared awkwardly back at his clients. They said nothing and he got up after my parents were motionning for me to hurry up.


He sat with us while my sister blew the candles and cut the cake. My parents insisted he takes a piece and join us in the selfie but he got up and walked back to his table looking pissed. We haven't talked til we met later at home.


He was upset and starred scolding me infront of my parents saying I embarrassed him and made him look unprofessional and ruined his business meeting. I told him he overreacted since it only took few minutes and it was my sister's birthday and my family wanted him to join since he was literally in the same restaurant. He called me ignorant and accused me of tampering with his work but I responded that ignoring mine and my family's presence was unacceptable.


We argued then he started stone walling me and refusing to talk to me at all.


FYI) I didn't have an issue with him missing the event, but after seeing that he was already there then it become a different story.

Also it literally took 5-7 minutes. He didn't even eat nor drink. Just sat down and watched.",21413,z6w0l5,"Business meetings are not the same thing as dinner with friends where you can just excuse yourself for a moment to chat with your family. When you attend a meeting, it is expected that the people in it have cleared up their schedules so the appointment won't be interrupted.YOU know it was a coincidence, but your husband's business partners might be thinking you guys arranged the dinners to be in the same restaurant and that would damage his professionalism in their eyes. 

Also, you husband said he didn't want to attend the celebration, he said he had a business meeting, that sounds REALLY important, BTW,  and what do you do? You coerce him to participate anyway. I get why he blew up with you, OP, whether you realized it or not, you acted disrespectfully, unprofessionally and you may have jeopardized his career.

AITA for refusing to make my husband apologize for what he said to my mom at dinner table?,"So, I f31 recently got married to my husband Scott m36. Before I met him I was engaged to my former fiance Martin, but we broke it off because this relationship was sort of pushed by my family because he's a doctor and comes from a wealthy family. When our relationship ended mom was devastated. She did her best to bring us back together, For example she lied to Martin about me being pregnant to save ""us"". That was years ago now we're all on good terms including Martin. Mom has a bit of tension towards Scott, she treats him well but constantly makes passive, nagging comments about him. She compares him to Martin all the time which bothers both of us but we try to let it slide.

Mom kept telling Scott about the diamond ring, new car, and bank account Martin got for his fiancee and kept sending him photos saying how generous Martin is to his fiancee than compared him to Scott and what he had done for me. I told her stop doing this and she apologized.

Last week, we were over at my parents house for a social gathering, lot of relatives came and we had dinner. At dinner table mom asked Scott if he saw the text she sent him the other day, he said he was sorry and that he didn't notice. She told him to check it right then and read it out loud so everyone at the table could hear. He took his phone and started reading the text out loud. Her text mentioned how Martin got his fiancee a new house and how generous he was, then said that Martin is younger than Scott, yet was able to buy a house. Basically shaming Scott for his inability to buy a house. She wrapped up by saying that Martin maybe wasn't so bad for me afterall. I was shocked and Scott was pissed obviously, however, he didn't lash out or anything he looked at the text, smiled and said ""you know, what gets me about this entire text is how you were a public educator for 30 years, yet you can't differentiate between the passive ""you"" and the contraction ""you're"", Good God! The thought of all the children that must've been left behind!"". Everyone at the table busted into laughter and mom's face went pale. She decided to leave the table then she and my sister started yelling at me saying Scott was being awfully rude and I need to get him to apologize immediately forembarrassing mom at the table. I refused to tell him to apologize then pointed out how she was being judgemental towards him, she defended herself saying she was just letting him know and he had no confidence and took it personally. I left but kept getting told to talk to him and get him to apologize for what he did.",21381,tx7nhc,">she treats him well but constantly makes passive, nagging comments about him.

AITA for embarrassing my stepdad in front of his family saying he’s in *my* house?,"For the past few months I (17m) haven’t had a good relationship with my mom or stepdad. I’m angry at them because 2 years ago when my dad passed away he left me inheritance that I’m supposed to get on my 18th bday. I’m also getting survivors benefits that my mom uses for me when I need things so is not like she used this inheritance  for me. 

They bought a house that we moved into. It was weird for me because we always lived in a 3 bedroom apartment. My stepdad is a substitute teacher and my mom’s a part time reception.  They never even had enough to go for a vacation or something but all of a sudden they had for a large house out of nowhere. Mg mom looked guilty about it until she finally admitted they used some of what my dad left me to buy the house. I lost my shit. 

They tried to justify that it was for me too and I asked them does that mean they’re moving out when I’m 18 an the house is gone be in my name? And they’re like no. That’s what I thought. Supposedly the house was for my but max time I would’ve lived there was a few months. 

There’s still some money left if I went to a cheap college but still can’t believe they used my money for something on themselves. That amount could’ve helped me get my own damm house. Also think is funny since my stepdad didn’t like my dad because since I was spending more time with him that meant my mom had to pay a little in child support. 

But he doesn’t care using the money he left for me. Sorry if this a bit of a rant but where I’m asking it I was an asshole was last Saturday his family all came to stay at the house. They stayed Friday night so it was nxt morning when I’m getting ready to go to work. I made myself eggs in a hurry before I left my stepdad asked how come there wasn’t more for his family. And told him it’s because I’m already leaving for work there wasn’t gonna be time to make something for everyone. He acted like it’s not a big deal if I’m a little late since its rare they have people over at the house. 

We got back in forth because I’m not going to stop to make breakfast whne he can do it himself. Then he pulled that don’t talk to me like that in my house. Btw there’s no door in the kitchen and that leads right to the living room so they could hear all this. I said loudly actually it’s *my* house since you paid for it with my money and don’t forget they stole from me. 

My mom is expecting me to apologize for embarrassing him in front of his whole family because after I left they all had shit to say about it. They already went home by the time I got home but you could feel the tension. He straight up ignored me that’s how bad it was. I don’t feel like there’s anything for me to apologize for so that’s where she thinks I’m not being a good son and kind of an a-hole.

AITA for wanting to take my daughter fishing?,"For over a decade, myself and my four best friends have had an annual fishing trip. There has always been a ""no wives, no girlfriends rule"" since the beginning, and no one has ever violated it.

Two years ago, my friend ""Tim"" told the group he wanted to bring his five year old son, to sort of pass the tradition on to the next generation. At that point, only Tim and I had kids, but my daughter was three and two young for fishing. We all supported Tim's idea and made a big deal over the little guy. He had a great time and came last year as well.

My other friend, ""Randy"" has a four month old son now. When the baby was born, Tim gave Randy a children's fishing pole to give to his son on his fifth birthday. So it seemed clear to me that the tradition had evolved to us + our kids, which I'm cool with.

I mentioned to my friends the other day that my daughter was excited for this year's fishing trip and they looked at me like I was crazy. Tim said I shouldn't bring her, and I was baffled. I was super supportive of him bringing his son. This is no different. My daughter is now the age Tim's son was when he first came on the trip.

Another friend brought up the ""no wives, no girlfriends"" rule, which pissed me off. My five year old daughter isn't anyone's wife or girlfriend. I said if they don't want my daughter there, then I don't want Tim's son there. Tim was offended and stormed out. Randy said what I said was uncalled for. I said I'm bringing my daughter and that's that.

I just want to make sure I'm not being an entitled prick. AITA?

Update: I sent this post to my friends, and we talked some more. They ended up apologizing. Daughter is definitely coming on the trip.

I know many people assumed that my friends are sexist and horrible, but they're really not. They were just worried that with daughter there we would have to stay at a hotel instead of the usual cabin and not be able to do as many activities, but I assured them my daughter can sleep without air conditioning as easily as Tim's son and they are going to be the ones having trouble keeping up with her five year old energy.

Everyone apologized for bringing up the ""no wives, no girlfriends rule"" and agreed that was a shitty thing to say. It's all good now. Thank you for your support.",21350,vjzw38,"NTA. If I were you i'd ditch their trip and take your daughter on a fishing trip one on one. Clearly when they said ""no wives, no girlfriends"" they meant no females.

AITA for saying I’d call the police if a family heirloom wasn’t returned to my adopted daughter?,"On mobile and I’ve never posted here before so sorry in advance.

I (28f) met my husband X (30m) 10yrs ago. At the time, he was a single dad to a 6mo baby girl, Lily(11f). I worked at the bakery he’d stop at every Saturday before their walk, and eventually we started going out. We got married 6yrs ago, and I legally adopted Lily soon after that.

In my family, it’s a tradition that the oldest daughter gets gifted an old sapphire ring on her 11th birthday. The ring belonged to my grandmother, who gave it to my aunt, who gave it to me because all of my cousins are male. Lily’s 11th birthday was a few months ago, and I gave the ring to her because she’s my oldest daughter. She loves that ring more than anything. She put it on a chain to wear around her neck so that she could keep better track of it, and in the months that she’s had it, I’ve never seen her take it off.

My sister Mia (24f) is one of Lily’s favorite people. Lily really loves her aunt, and sometimes Mia will just text to let me and X know that she’s picking Lily up from school to go eat or go to the bookstore or something like that. The other day, I got one of those texts from Mia, so I just told her to be safe, have fun, and make sure my daughter came home at a decent time because it was a school night.
Lily got home about an hour after we had dinner, and she barely said hello to her dad or me before she went up to her room. I thought that maybe she was just tired, so he and I didn’t immediately ask her what was going on, but later that night I went to go check on her because I wanted to be sure.

When I walked into her room I saw that she had been crying. I asked her what was wrong, and it took a minute, but she eventually told me that Mia took the ring from her because it’s a *family* heirloom that’s supposed to go to the “actual” oldest daughter and because I adopted her, that means she isn’t really family.
The only reason I didn’t go to Mia’s apartment that night to get it back was because I spent the rest of the evening reassuring Lily that she is my family, and she is 100% my “actual” oldest daughter no matter what our DNA is or what anyone else says.

I left Mia a voicemail the next morning telling her to return the ring before I drive over there and get it myself. She texted saying she would only give it to me if I had a daughter before she did, but until then she’d keep it safe to make sure I didn’t give it back to “the wrong person”. So then I told her that if she didn’t return the ring by 2pm that day, I would be calling the police and reporting it stolen.

She started texting like crazy, saying I was being ridiculous and doing too much.

AITA for ruining my work colleagues wedding and getting them arrested?,"The title sounds bad, but hear me out.

I (38f) had 2 work colleagues, Mary and Adam (both in their late 20s-early 30s). Mary started in the company first and then she got Adam to join, they worked in different departments and Mary was in mine. Later, Mary left the company to pursue another carrier. When they started at the company, they were already married for a few years.

Now Mary is the kindest and loveliest person I've ever met. She was always polite, helpful and would cheer anyone up. We missed her dearly. So it came to a shock when we found out she is divorcing Adam because he has cheated on her. I have called her to express how sorry I am that this has happened to her and we were talking almost daipy ever since. I was impressed how well Mary holds herself in such situation, she wouldn't bad mouth Adam and the only thing she mentioned was how her wedding dress and a few family heirlooms went missing when she was moving her stuff from their apartment. She thought they might be misplaced in a different box and will turn up eventually.

A few years passed, I now work in the same department as Adam. He is a good work colleague but can be dismissive and ignorant sometimes. Adam invited me to his wedding with the lady, ""Chelsea"" he cheated on Mary with. As the entire department was invited, I said yes, making sure Mary is OK with this. I've also told her where the wedding will be. (It's not too far from where she lives and we could go for some drinks after if she wanted to)

On the day of Adams wedding, I have noticed that Chelsea is wearing a similar dress that Mary worn in the photos of hers and Adams wedding years ago. So without thinking I have snapped a picture and send it to Mary with the caption saying: ""doesn't this dress looks familiar?"". Mary saw the message but she didn't respond and about an hour later the police shown up at the venue. 

I need to add the police in our country is ruthless and any theft is considered a criminal matter for the police to deal with. Police has asked Chelsea to take the dress and all the jewellery off, Chelsea refused and started arguing with them, and then Adam joined in. As they were rude to the police, they were taken to the police station. Everyone at the wedding had to leave. I have tried to call Mary but she wouldn't pick up the phone.

As we found out later Chelsea was wearing Mary's wedding dress and her heirlooms, Mary spotted them on her in the picture I sent to her and called the police. Apparently, she has previously asked Adam if he had them, and he declined, saying he never saw them. So after she saw the picture she knew he was lying and stole them. Chelsea had to leave the wedding dress and jewelery at the police station and go home wearing her underwear and Adams jacket after they were bailed out.

Yesterday Adam returned to the office and went completely mental at me, blaming me for sending a picture to Mary and ruining his wedding, he would also call me an asshole for what I did.",21342,sl9xml,"NTA I can’t believe he would give his ex wife’s wedding dress and family jewelry to his new wife to wear in their wedding!

AITA for not sticking up for my grandmother after my wife told her to f- off out of her hospital room?,"About 3 weeks ago my Wife-33 went into premature labor with our daughter at 31 weeks. It was entirely unexpected and both my wife and our daughter had a horrible time and it became quite dangerous for the both of them. My wife became preeclamptic among other serious complications and for the first week we weren't even sure if either my wife or our daughter would make it. Luckily they both survived but our daughter is still in the nicu after 3 weeks and probably will be in for another 3, and my wife is still in the hospital as well.

It has been a horrible struggle for my wife. Before this she was a very healthy and active person and even during most of her pregnancy she was able to maintain a somewhat active lifestyle, but because of the trauma her body went through she is basically starting back from square one and hasn't even been able to hold our daughter yet. My wife has had a lot of struggles so far with her birth trauma and feels so confused and hurt by her experience. She told me that she feels betrayed by her own body and even in some of her weakest moments she even said she regretted getting pregnant entirely because of how much she has suffered and she is so worried she'll never be the person she was again. She feels horrible for having these feelings but I and multiple mental health professionals have been working to help and support her through this. 

We finally have reached a point where we can receive visitor's. Her family lives close but my family lives 3 states away and have been awaiting the chance to meet the baby and check in on my wife. My parents and grandparents flew down and I warned my family beforehand that my wife and daughter are still at very fragile stages and to be patient. When I brought them in to see my wife my grand mother immediately went and wanted to talk to her about the birth and her experience. My wife told her that it was one of the worst experiences of her life and my grandmother responded by telling her that the ""worst is yet to come"" and that struggling is what being a mother is about. My wife got very upset over this comment and started screaming at her to f- off and to get the f out. I had never seen my wife like this and I could tell she was feeling extremely stressed and I quickly escorted my family out. I told them it would be best if they left for now and we could talk later as not to cause even more stress on my wife. 

My family said they were ""appalled"" by my wifes behavior and me for not defending my grandmother, but at the end of the day I feel that it is my responsibility to be my wife's advocator all of the time but especially now. It has become a bit of a ""tension"" in my extended side of the family however, but I haven't told my wife about it because I don't want to stress her out and I plan to deal with this alone entirely. Should I apologize on my wifes behalf? If I am the AH I'll own up to it, but I don't see my wife as an AH at all.",21326,t8scx2,"NTA x1000!!!

You stood up for your wife in her most vulnerable state. That was ridiculously rude of your grandmother. **DO NOT** apologize to them for your wife.
