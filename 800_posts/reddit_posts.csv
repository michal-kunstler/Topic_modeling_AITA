AITA for bringing my SIL’s wallet to the restaurant when she conveniently always forgets it?,"Edit: update on profile

My (f28) SIL “Amy” (f26) always comes to visit from out of town. She stays with us instead of a hotel, and always wants to go to expensive restaurants. She always conveniently forgets her wallet, or domes up with some excuses as to why she can’t pay her share. She has implied that since I make much more money than her, I should be the one to pay (no, not my husband should pay, but me *specifically*). I do make a fair amount of money, but not so much that I can treat someone every time they come into town. Nonetheless, in the past, I have just paid the bill and asked her to pay me back. She never has. 

She had made a reservation at an extremely expensive restaurant last night, and before we left, I made it clear that I wouldn’t be paying her bill. 

This is where I might be the asshole, and I’ll admit I got this move straight from and episode of Two and a Half men. As we were leaving, her and my husband went to the car. I pretended I forgot something and went back inside. I found her wallet sitting right on top of her suitcase. I put it in my purse and we went to the restaurant.

When we were done eating, I asked for separate bills. She said no, we need one bill, because she “forgot” her wallet again. I reached in my purse and said, “this wallet?” 

She was extremely furious. She said that I should not have touched or grabbed her wallet. 

So AITA for taking her wallet and bringing it to the restaurant?

Edit: Wow, thanks for all the awards!!! Jeez lol! So many comments that I can’t keep up, but thank you to everyone who had something to say.

Edit 2: Amy just called me, she saw this post and she yelled at me for ""badmouthing"" her on the internet. Honestly I don't care. Amy, hopefully reading all these comments is a wake up call for you.",68512,x2k5kv,"NTA. Stone cold busted.

"AITA for bringing up my brother's ""premature"" birth at Christmas dinner to get my parents to shut up?","I am a nurse practitioner and I am the primary care provider for a lot of the low risk maternity cases at the practice where I work.  I also work hand in hand with the doctors and midwives to create a healthy maternity, birth, and postpartum situation. 

My fiancee is completing her residency.  We live together and have for a few years now.  We aren't in any hurry to get married.  We originally had plans to do so a couple of years ago but then we got really busy for two years.  

It is driving my very religious parents crazy that their youngest son is living in sin.  I don't really care.  I'm an adult and I do what I want.  We are getting married in June.  

So we are visiting my parents for Christmas. The way it came together this year everyone is at my parents house.  So that's my folks, my three siblings, myself and fiancee, and seven grandchildren.  So seventeen people.  

At dinner my mom starts going on about how she is so glad that we are finally getting married and she won't be embarrassed at church any more.  And my dad says how proud he is of his three older kids who all either waited to get married before moving in together or got married right away after moving in together.  My fiancee was getting embarrassed and I was getting mad over this stupid argument we have had too many times. And a family dinner was the last straw.  

I have asked them repeatedly to just accept that they cannot control how I live my life.  I refuse to stay with them when I visit even if I come alone.  Hotels are just easier.  

So I started talking about a premature baby I had been reading about.  It was almost three months premature and weighed about 1.6 pounds. It was super strong and healthy for being born so little and the NICU had high hopes for the baby doing well.  

My mom and dad both got deer in the headlights looks on their faces.  To bad. Should not have fucked around with my fiancee's feelings.  

So I asked about my oldest brother.  He was born almost four months premature.  Is there a chance that we could check out the family album where we keep all the records of family births and stuff.  

I already know my brother was over 9 pounds and almost 23"" long when he was born.  My grandmother told me all about it the first time my parents tried to shame me. 

The subject gets changed very fast.  After supper my parents told me that I should not try to embarrass them with private things that are not my concern.  I told them that if I heard anything about my living arrangements ever again for the rest of my life I would make sure to keep bringing up the FACT that my mom was in her second trimester when they got married.

My parents are mad at me for telling them how to behave in their own home.  But my fiancee is happy that they seem to be off the subject for good.  

AITA?",56259,zvmflw,You can tell the family about the time you were embarrassed at the Univ.  Where you told everyone in your class that it was normal for someone to be 9lbs at 6 months.

AITA for not taking down my video that was a gift from my best man.,"I have a sister that’s 6 years older than me. 

My parents for years cancel on me last min because of my sister. I have a basketball game. Ops sorry sister doesn’t feel like going out. I am graduating ops sorry sister had a bad day at work. They have missed both major and smaller events in my life because of her melt downs.

I met the love of my life. We decided to tie the knot. From the beginning I told my parents how I am worried my sister will ruin another special moment in my life. My mom told me over and over again it would not happen.

The day of my wedding. I received a voicemail from my mom saying they couldn’t come because my sisters dog was sick and she was upset.

I was hurt, my best man however is a jokester. He took my phone then went to my fiancé and asked if he could post a video of our wedding as a gift? On social media. She loved his idea.

I had no idea about it until I came home. Our honeymoon was at a lake side cabin. No cell service.

The post caption was “My best friend. He is an amazing person even if his parents NEVER showed up for him.  video was still pictures of us next to her parents, me on the dance floor, cutting the cake. Where you would normally see both parents in wedding pictures. The sound behind the video was my moms voice mail explaining how they couldn’t come because my sisters dog was sick.

I came home a week later to hundreds of messages.
Family members from both sides insisting I take it down. I was told my sister hasn’t stopped crying. My mom is refusing to leave the house. 

I maybe the A here. I didn’t take it down when I got my messages. I didn’t call my family back right away. I waited until my vacation time was over at work and enjoyed my time with my Wife. In our new home. Before I contacted anyone.

My dad told me to take down the video. It was “just a bad night for them”. That they will make it up to me and my wife for not coming. My reply was exactly how do you plan to “make up” my wedding? It’s a once in a life time thing. You choose to ignore my feeling on the whole matter.

Then he just repeated he will make it up to me. I told him I would take down the video only when he made up missing my wedding. Flustered we both hung up the phone before we both said things we shouldn’t have.

Am I the A here. I could have just taken down the video.",54743,wyjbjs,"NTA

My parents missed my wedding too all because my sister didn’t want to come because my husband is from Italy & we had it in his hometown & she didn’t like the weather forecast.Lol.No joke. 
Even despite their tickets & accommodation being paid for.
(Story of my life. Missed events due to her issues/needs & I can’t/don’t even blame my sister because she’s so enabled by my parents enabling & doesn’t know better lol)

Didn’t know until the night before needing to pick them up at airport.

I cried and then laughed and then got married without them. 

Never spoke to anyone ever again and been NC for almost 15 years.

You get to a point where you realize that what you allow will continue. 

Don’t ever take that video down.

Let them be reminded every year it comes up that they are to blame and their mistakes are the reason you cut them off.",1578,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wyjbjs/aita_for_not_taking_down_my_video_that_was_a_gift/
UPDATE AITA for walking out of the Airport when I saw my husband's mom standing there with her luggage?,"Hello!.


I don't know where to begin...it's been an absolute nightmare recently. And I feel like I was losing my sanity.

So for more details about my situation. I have to admit that my husband's mom favors him over all his siblings. this affected his relationship with them and me as well. He's never seen an issue with how differently his mom treats him, it bothered me and made me feel uncomfortable. The whole dynamic made me feel uncomfortable. Going Low contact has never even been an option. Like he has to see her or call her everyday.

Most of his siblings don't talk to him and I 100% believe it's because of his mom's favoritism like I said. He does bare some blame for not seeing how wrong this is til this day.

In many instances I found myself making excuses for his behavior. Even in my post. I did it spontaniously and I don't know why. But I guess it's because of how much I love him and because I really really wanted to be able to work things this type of things out without letting them affect our marriage.


regarding what happened with the trip, He tried to have a talk with me and most of what he said came from place of blame,  Blame towards me. I just couldn't continue with this argument. I told him I needed space and that I would be going to stay with my sister for a while. He didn't take it well, he literally got up from the couch and opened the door telling me to go right then. In that moment and seeing how he was still not even anywhere near understanding what he has done just....made things perfectly clear to me. I just had pictured years and years of my life being lived like that and I was like no...I can't do it, Can't take anymore of it especially when he keeps focusing on being right every time. His mom can do no wrong. I'm always the aggressive, crazy, jealous, pathetic, overreactor.

All these people's opinions, advice and concerns were like a spark...like the wake up call I really needed. Though I wish that it didn't get this far but what's done is done.


Right now I'm staying with my sister (I brought my dog with me as well) He sent me his last message telling I'm the one choosing to end what we had together but I believe it's the other way around, especially with how he keeps making his mom the victim in this situation. It's become clear now that we keep going in circles with no end in reach and I'm just so exhausted and overwhelmed. I'm not mad at him and don't expect him to change but...at least I'm given options to decide what's best for me and my future even if it's seperation and divorce.

A big thank you to those who reached out with resources that I feel very very lucky to have come across. Just wanted to give you an update since many of you asked for it.",51464,ur2l3s,"I'm sorry you are going through this, but I'm also so very, very, very proud of you. You are standing up for yourself.

AITA for walking out of the Airport when I saw my husband's mom standing there with her luggage?,"

I F30 don't have the best relationship with my husband's mom. Since day one she tried to make remarks and compare me to her ??. She then tried to get on my good side and started overly praising everything I do and sometimes even copying me like that one time when she LITERALLY dyied her hair purple just like mine and when everyone pointed out how ridiculous she looked, she actually blamed me and accused me of trying to make a joke out of her.



So, Anyways! My husband and I took 2 weeks off work to go visit some places out of the country - tourism in other words. Thing is I was the one who saved up for and arranged for the trip (my husband was responsible for booking the tickets). My husband's mom wanted to come along and threw temper tantrums when I said no. She called, texted, sent people to talk to me into letting her come, even threatened to call the police and make some complaint up to get us to stay if she can't come. My husband said we should just take her but I told him he was wrong to tell her about the trip in the first place. He gave me an ultimatim. said he wouldn't go if she can't come and I told him I'd gladly call his bluff which made him take his words back and say ""FINE! I will tell her to stop it because we won't take her"".

Things got quieter, suspeciously quieter. the day of the trip came and we got to the airport at 2pm. My husband was walking ahead of me and was looking left and right like he was looking for someone. I asked him but he didn't respond. He lead me to the waiting area and first thing I saw was his mom standing there with her luggage . I froze in my spot, I felt a cold wave washing over me and I was fuming inside. She and my husband were hugging that's when I quietly turned around and started walking towards the exit. My husband followed me while shouting at me to stop. he tried to stop me but I told him off the harshest way possible. He tried to say I was overreacting and that his mom was there ""anyway"" and I should let it go and not mess the trip up for us. I told him he and his mom could still go and that I was going home.

I went home and sobbed into my dog's fur for several minutes. turned out he booked her a ticket without me knowing. an hour later he came home yelling and raging about how pathetic and spiteful I was to walk out and go home and ruin the trip last minute. I told him he caused this to happen. he said that I was being so hard on his mom it's ridiculous. I refused to fight any more but he kept on berating me then called my family to tell them that the trip was cancelled and that it was because of me. My family said that I shouldn't have ruined it for myself and should've sucked it up and done my best to enjoy.

Did I really overreact?",50024,unhse2,"Definitely NTA. You know that if you had sucked it up and gone with them, the entire vacation would be all about catering to his mom. Whatever SHE wanted to do. Whatever places SHE wanted to go, places SHE wanted to eat.

"AITA for dropping our dinner on the ground and walking out when my boyfriend asked me ""What's for dinner tonight, b*tch?""","I was over my boyfriend's apartment this weekend and I was cooking dinner because he was studying for exams. I made pasta and a chunky sauce with meatballs and veggies. I told him dinner was ready and he goes ""what's for dinner tonight, B*TCH"" ... With like a lot of emphasis on the last word. 

I was fed up, I'd had a pretty rough day with work and I have some awfully bad associations with that word being used by other people in my life who were pretty abusive. So I was so irritated that I dropped the pot of pasta sauce I'd been carrying right on the ground and was like ""Well nothing's for dinner tonight now. And I better not hear you using that word again, it's for the girls""

He was freaking out about how sauce had landed on his rug and he even said ""you're seriously acting like a bitch right now, I dunno what else to call it""

I just walked out and got takeout for myself and went to my friends house. She thought it was funny but my boyfriend was furious, he kept texting and calling and sending me voice memos trying to explain that saying ""what's for dinner tonight b*tch"" was a TikTok trend.... And that he was just quoting something as a joke to put on tiktok. 

I thought that was the shittiest excuse ever, it doesn't matter if he saw it as a joke, or stole the ""joke"", it was still disrespectful. 

But it didn't change the fact he thought that shit was funny, to demean me when I was trying to do him a favor. Like hell I came over when he was studying to make a home cooked dinner and he decides it's time for jokes? So I put my phone on don't disturb for the night and split a bottle of wine with my friend and her roommate. 

The next morning he was sending me angry texts demanding I clean his rug because he was too busy with exams to do it. I was shocked he left it overnight, that's disgusting. I texted him back saying.

""Yeah so that's the b*tch tax honey :) leave me alone till you're ready to handle your own cooking and cleaning because this b*tch isn't anymore. Also it's vile you left that soaking in all night""

He called me and told me that he was okay with doing his own household work, but I did throw a full pot of sauce at the ground so that's on me to clean up. 

I told him ""yeah no I'm not comfortable doing chores for you if you see me like your b*tch"" 

He told me he didn't and it was just a ""trend"" and I got pissed off he was playing that ""TikTok trend"" BS excuse again and I told him ""Well I'm starting a trend called 'saucing' where as a little joke people throw pasta sauce around! You can't be mad because it's just a little trend, a little jokey joke, just a little prank bro!"" 

He got really pissed off and hung up on me and now I'm seriously wondering if this dumb fucking tiktok joke is gonna be the end of things between us

AITA for how I reacted when my boyfriend asked me ""what's for dinner tonight, b*tch""

Edit to address a comment I've gotten a lot and I don't have time to reply to every time:

> ""But did you tell him not to call you a bitch? Like how would he know otherwise?""

Honestly if someone has gotten to the age of 30 and not realized that women (as a whole) do not like having demeaning slurs used against them... They're beyond my help. 

This isn't something that needs to be told. I shouldn't have to go through life like ""Hey man just in case you were thinking I might like demeaning slurs against my gender used on me, I don't actually :)""

And if you were about to comment something like that, let me just tell you in no uncertain terms... WOMEN DO NOT LIKE BEING CALLED BITCHES BY MEN. DO NOT CALL WOMEN BITCHES. IF YOU NEEDED TO BE TOLD THAT IS UNKIND, CONSIDER YOURSELF OFFICIALLY TOLD.

"AITA for getting up from my chair in the middle of christmas dinner and shouting ""SHUT THE FUCK UP ABOUT MY BODYYYYY"" in response to my husband's observation?","So, Ever since I had my son months ago, my husband has started making indirect comments about my body. He never says any hurtful words but I find his ""observations"" as he calls it hurtful.

AITA for silently getting up and walking out of the restaurant during NYE dinner after I was told to pay for everyone at the table (my inlaws)?,"
I f32 recently inherited a good amount of money from my mom. I keep the money in a seperate account as I still haven't decided what to do with it and I didn't want it to go to waste.


I noticed my husband constantly bringing up the inheritance money and making countless suggestions as to how I should spend it. Another thing is that he expects me pay for nearly everything the past couple of weeks.


For NYE, My husband and I met up with his family at a restaurant to celebrate. It was going fine until I found out that I was expected to pay for everyone at the table. My husband's mom joked about paying for dinner out of my "" inheritance pocket"" which made me livid but I showed no reaction. Just silently paid for my own food/drinks. Then got up and made my way out of the restaurant. They were shouting after me like a crowd and my husband tried to get me to come back but I drove home.


He got back at 3 a.m yeling at me saying I was pathetic to get up and walk out on him and his family after they *relied* on me to pay for their food and thougt I was gracious enough to do it BUT they were wrong. He said I humiliated him and family and that what I did was an attempt to get back at them for not being able to help mom when she was sick. Not true is all I'm gonna say.

"AITA for how I fought my boyfriend's medical bill, going ""too far""?","My boyfriend had to go to the ER after a accident, and he got a truly ridiculous bill back. I offered to fight the bill for her because I've done it before, and he said sure. 

I went all-out, because honestly if we were out 5 grand, after insurance, that would fuck up our holiday plans pretty bad. 

So I...

- had him call the hospital and authorize me to handle his bill and access his medical records. 

- got an itemized bill and compared the prices for each code to the fair prices

- called billing to dispute the bill, but was told that billing only collects bills, I'd need to contact admin to dispute

- bounced around a call center for hours trying to get someone who was actually qualified for bill disputes, and getting nowhere 

- google and linkedin searched for the hospital board of directors and upper management 

- got 30 emails of the most influential people at the hospital, plus the hospital's investors

- every day would send a few emails, working my way up the chain, and writing an (increasingly long) email describing how they billed my ""client"" at 7 times over the fair price for services rendered, and how their billing department, customer service department, and the growing list of management I'd emailed, had failed to address the issue. 

- escalated the emails until I was writing the director-level staff with the entire board of directors and a number of outside investors CC'd, asking for a written statement regarding their justification for billing at a rate 7 times higher than the national average, for commensurate services to what is available at other hospitals. And sternly laying out the failures to appropriately respond, at every level of the company. 

Well, once I'd done all that (which was honestly only like 15 minutes a day) they reduced the bill... From $5000 to $26. Yep, twenty-six fuckin dollars. 

Well, I told my boyfriend the good news, and he was at first overjoyed and blown away, like literally jumping up and down and hugging me and saying I was literally a Christmas miracle. 

But then when he asked how I did it, I said it wasn't too hard, I just had to send a couple emails each day. He was curious what I'd said, and I handed him my phone. 

He started to get stressed, and flipping back through other emails. Which there were like 60 of.

He told me I went way too far, he was expecting me to dispute through their billing department or something normal and reasonable like that, not internet stalk every single manager and board member and investor and harass them into dropping the bill. 

I was frustrated because I'd just saved us 5 grand, actually made it possible for us to afford a nice Christmas and save some money, and he was mad at me because I'd been a bit of a hardass? 

I was furious, and he was also mad at me, saying he authorized me to dispute a bill, not basically threaten and harass a whole damn hospital for weeks. 

AITA for how I got my boyfriend's medical bills dropped?",43592,zdk3bq,"NTA

Hospital billing is intentionally screwed up and difficult to address issues. When I gave birth to my kid 16 years ago, they double-billed everything and it took almost A YEAR to get it all straightened out. I pretty much had to schedule hours into my weekly schedule to deal with contesting collections, getting it sent back to billing, dealing with some other person in billing, and etc. With a newborn through 1yo, and while I was also working full-time. It was an additional part time job to ""fix the damn hospital bill.""

AITA for using flash cards to explain to my brother and his wife why they can't bring their rainbow baby to my wedding?,"
My fiancee (F) and I (M) are getting married. We've decided wedding's gonna be childfree. No hate towards children just to keep it more organized and contained.


My brother 'Chris' (M) and his wife (F) have a 3 yro son who everyone calls ""miracle"" or ""rainbow"" baby. He came after several failed pregnancies that lasted for years. 

When they found out that my nephew was included in the no children rule; they tried to convince me to make an exception for him. Chris told me his son is a miracle baby and his presence at the wedding will bring ""blessings"" for me and my fiancee. I refused and said no, the wedding is childfree. His wife kept sending my fiancee pics of my nephew when he was months old (what that mean??). I told them no, and to stop.


My brother told me this might cause a rift in our relationship, I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. He asked again and pointed out how his baby is different since he's a rainbow, a miracle baby. I again said no and explained that the wedding is childfree. They brought it up when they visited at my home and I knew they weren't going to stop so I'd made flash cards in advance with the phrase ""the wedding is childfree, period"" and pulled them out and started slowly showing them the flash cards one by one in this order: 

- The wedding (with a sticker of bride and groom). 

- Is Child (with a sticker of a baby). 

- FREEE (with a sticker of a 🚫 sign). 

- PERIOD (with a huge, black dot sticker). 

They both were stunned. I asked if they get it now and Chris had lost his shit. His wife had already grabbed her stuff and walked out. Chris called me an asshole for doing this and said that I disrespected him, his wife and their son who's my one and only nephew. He rushed out after we argued.

Thing is he barely attends any dr appointments with me and his excuses aren't even valid. He's willing to miss the dr appointment over soccer or a drink or board game with friends. His response is always ""I'm not the one carrying the baby, why do I have to go see the dr with you?"".


Last week was my final straw. He was supposed to come with me for the baby's gender reveal appointment but he chose to not come last minute because his friend invited him to fish 'n' chips meal. I was pretty livid but didn't make a fuss about it. Mom went with me instead.



He texted asking me to tell him the results (boy or girl) but I refused to tell him. He kept spam calling me but I hung up each time. He came home fuming demanding I tell him the results but I refused and bluntly told him, since he refused to attend the appointment then he gets no results til after the baby's born and said I was wiling to die on this hill. He went off calling me spiteful and immature for doing this and punishing him. He said he's the father and has the right to know. He then called me dramatic since I wasn't alone and mom was with me. I said he gets no results period.


He's been fuming about it and told his family and they're now pressuring me to stop playing mind games with him and tell him but I declined.




AITA?


EDIT/UPDATE: Hi, so, first of all, wow!!! I did not expect this to blow up. Sorry, can't answer any comments because of feeling overwhelmed...um I just wanted to mention that my husband just attempted to contact my dr to get the results. It didn't go well and we had another argument over it.

I would laugh if this didn't infuriate me as a father/husband who was present for every single appointment my wife went to for all three of our children.

If he wants to be present at the birth tell him ""You're not the one delivering the baby, why should you have to be there?""

AITA for cancelling mother's day celebration that I arranged for my wife after hearing what she told my son?,"

I (M/37) have a 13 y.o son. I was a widower when I met my now wife. She has a 16 y.o daughter from another relationship. The family is often on pretty good terms. My son is the quiet one in the house, he keeps to himself a lot but not to the point of being concerning. My wife and stepdaughter are the complete opposit. They both encourage him to be outgoing and share activities and join gatherings with extended family. My son complained about having to be forced out of his comfort zone and having his need for space invalidated. I spoke to both my wife and stepdaughter and asked them to give him space and freedom to spend his time however he wanted. they apologized and promised to let him be.

As mother's day was approaching I wanted to throw my wife a surprise mother's day celebration. It was no longer a surprise because my stepdaughter gave her the heads so she could prepare. Yesterday I got off work earlier than usual to get final arrangements done (we planned to celebrate at the restaurant and invited her family there) I had the key and while I was entering the house through the front door I overheard my wife and stepdaughter talking to my son. My wife was asking my son if he could convince me to let him stay home and not go with them to the restaurant to celebrate. I paused and decided to keep listening. My son said why and she told him that his introverted and socially inept ""attitude"" will make her family uncomfortable and will ruin the mood. He promised her that he'd be well behaved and would try to interact and socialize with everyone but she said that she wasn't buying it. He kept reassuring her but she snapped and told him that technically, she's not his mom so she didn't get why he wanted to celebrate mother's day with her so badly. My stepdaughter threw some (I don't remember) backhanded comment and then both of them were shocked to see me standing there. Both were staring without saying anything. I told my son and his stepsister to go to their rooms then told my wife that the celebration was off, cancelled. she tried to argue asking why repeatedly and I told her why. She tried to explain that she didn't mean it like that and that I only heard part of the conversation but not all of it. I told her I was done arguing and the decision was already made. She yelled asking what she was going to tell her family and said that I was making tremendous mistake towards her.

I ignored her while she kept throwing tantrum after a tantrum. Early this morning she took my stepdaughter and went to stay with her folks. not a single call or text from her so far. Situation is full of tension. I'm upset still but more hurt to be honest. I mean yes I did say I was going to havw this celebration but I thought that what she said to my son was too harsh to ignore.",41989,ulcrp6,NTA. But have you talked with your son?

AITA for kicking out one of my bridesmaids for showing up in the wrong dress?,"My (23F) wedding was back on Saturday December 31st and I'm still getting backlash from this, so I want to know if this was an AH move.

In the country I live in it's currently winter, and we get a fair amount of snow so my wedding was a winter themed wedding. The color theme was forest green and gold. My dress was obviously white, and I chose the color of my bridesmaids dresses to be forest green as well. My MOH""s dress was black, and everyone was to wear gold accessories. 

I have this friend, we'll call her Kat, that I asked to be one of my bridesmaids. When we went dress shopping and I told them the color theme I was going for, Kat immediately expressed that she thought forest green was a bad choice.

She said the thinks it's not a flattering color, and thought I should choose something different and more ""girly"". I said no because my wedding was winter themed and I thought the color would go perfect with the theme. She suggested a pink, blue even a red. I said no, but thanks' for your opinion. She found out my MOH""s dress was black and asked if she could wear black too? I said no, only my MOH is wearing black. 

I paid for all the dresses. 

Fast forward to wedding day, everyone's getting their hair and makeup done and Kat show's up 30 minutes late holding a bag that looked like it had a dress inside. I asked her what this was for? She told me it was for later on at the reception if she got uncomfortable and wanted to change after pictures. I was like ok cool.

So fast forward we're all dressed and walking down the stairs because the ceremony is beginning in 30 mins and we were going to take some pictures before. Kat is the last person to come down and she's wearing a BLACK DRESS. At the time I was preoccupied taking pictures with my parents, but my MOH came over to me and made me aware of the situation. 

I confronted Kat and asked her what was going on. She said she hates her bridesmaid dress, as the color is ugly and makes her look gross so she's wearing black. I told her please go back and change. She refused and started walking away from me. I said I'm going to ask her one more time, and if she doesn't oblige I'm calling security and kicking her out.  She began yelling at me to fuck off, so I called security and asked them to please escort her out. She started making a BIG scene yelling how I'm such a bitch, that I can't force her to wear anything and that I'm a horrible inconsiderate friend. 

The wedding went on and it was truly amazing.

Ever since the wedding Kat has been blowing up my phone with texts saying some really nasty thing's and asking for the money back she spent on the black dress, since it was a waste and she didn't get to wear it. I had to block her number. Some of my other bridesmaids have been giving me shit saying that it was a little harsh kicking her out and embarrassing her like that. And that maybe I should give her the money back. AITA for kicking her out?",41936,10av2g7,"NTA If you're going to be a bridesmaid, you have to be prepared to do what the bride wants.

AITA for throwing them out of a house that we own. Son and future In-Laws decide to exclude his family from wedding. They thought son owned the house not us.,"My wife and I bought a four bedroom house in PA that my son lives in.  Our son went to College in PA and wanted to stay in the area.  So we bought the house as a second home, we live in NJ and commute into Manhattan for work.  We figured that he would have a place to live and we could visit every so often and spend some quality time together. 

We pay the taxes and services / maintenance on the house, our son pays for his groceries and the house utilities. All was going well for a few years, our son meets a girl and they get serious. We met her and she seems nice enough.  The announce their engagement and she moves into the house with our son.  

Now for the problem: The wedding !!! 

We hold a little get to know you BBQ at the PA house, my son and daughter are there, as are our sons fiancé and her parents, and sisters.   We all seem to be getting along well, my wife, daughter and the fiancé go into the house along with her mother an sisters and my son.  A few minutes later my wife and daughter come out and are really upset. The come over and tell me we're leaving and driving back to NJ.  I try to find out what happened.  Once we get back to NJ and they calmed down they tell me that our son and his fiancé along with her family don't want us at the wedding.  According to what I was told ""We're not their kind of people"".  I was livid, I called my son and asked him WTH this was about.  He tells me that her family feel that we are not good enough and will embarrass them at a family wedding and that we are all uninvited from the wedding.  

I let a week go by to calm myself down and drive back to the PA house, the new future in-laws are in the house along with the fiancé.  It appears that they all moved into the house They ask me why I'm there, I tell them that since we aren't invited to the wedding, I was coming over to talk to my son.  They tell me to leave their house.  I lost it, and told them that they had 30 days to get out.  Tell my son I'm selling the house and he could find somewhere else to live with all of you.  I go to a realtor in town and list the house for sale. 

They call my son at work and tell him what I said.  Apparently they thought that he owned the house. He calls me and asks why I'm selling his house, I tell him I paid for it along with the taxes on it and it is mine.  He was living there rent free, but since he doesn't want us in his new life, he has to get out.  I tell him the same as I told his future in-laws they have 30 days to get out then I'll get a lawyer and get them evicted.

AITA for getting my daughter a hotel room entirely for herself after her stepsisters made her sleep on the floor?,"My dad passed away 2 weeks ago. Me, my wife 'Candace' and my daughter (16) 'Shiloh' and her stepsisters (19) & (17) flew to my hometown to attend the funeral. After that we got 2 hotel rooms (one for me and Candace, one for the girls).


While I was in the room, I got a call from Shiloh at 11pm crying and sounded like she was arguing with her stepsisters. I asked what the matter was and she told me that her stepsisters insisted that she sleep on the floor (there were one large bed in the room and there was enough space for all 3 girls to sleep on). I asked why and she said she didn't know. I went to see what the issue was and talked with my stepdaughters about it. They kept talking but didn't really explain why they told her to sleep on the floor. They just shrugged and said ""It's better this way...we're more comfortable this way.."". I told Shiloh to grab her things and when one of my stepdaughters asked where we were going, I told her I was booking her a hotel room. Both looked upset but didn't say anything but they must've called their mom because she was awake when I got back and started arguing with me about giving Shiloh an entire hotel room for herself. I explained why I did it but she said I wasted money and that Shiloh could've sucked it up for one night on the floor. I called her unreasonable for saying this but she told me I showed the girls that I'm ""playing favorites"" and made my stepdaughters share a room while I gave my daughter and entire room for herself.

We went home and Candace is still bringing it up saying I mishandled this. She even pointed out how my stepdaughters are upset since they're not speaking to me.


ETA It was Candace who got a room for the 3 girls as to not stir any drama and save money. She was in charge of hotel reservation since I was emotionaly distressed.

Also. Candace did NOT expect Shiloh to sleep on the floor. She wanted all 3 girls to share the bed.



ETA#2 For those that are calling me an ah for giving my daughter her name. Her mom did that and she's deceased so please let's not focus on that.

AITA for getting mad my artist hid their initials in my tattoo?,"This is a short one. Names changed for privacy. 

I went to a tattoo shop in my area, with a photo of the tattoo I wanted. It was one my dad had gotten to honor my passed grandfather who’s father also had it. But the point is - it was important to me that the tattoo looked EXACTLY as it did in the photo. 

I get to the shop, I explain everything, I pay, get the tattoo, and we’re done, I think it looks awesome, everything is great! Until a few weeks later when I show my great grandmother the tattoo. She’s static, grabs my arm to look at and compliment it, then asks, “Who’s AJ?” 

I ask her what she means, and she points out on the tattoo where the initials A and J or maybe T were hidden into the tattoo. I’m instantly pissed, as my artists name is Alice Trever. She tries to assure me it’s no big deal if I hadn’t noticed it til now, but I still reached out to the artist sort of irritated. They told me the style of art I got is called traditional and it’s “pretty trad” for all artists who do that style to do it. I demanded a partial refund and they refused, so I complained to the owner who made the artist give me a full refund. 

Now the artist is running a full smear campaign, talking about moving shops, and all kinds of crap.

AITA for speaking Italian to my GF's rude Italian American family and embarrassing them?,"**ETA**: There may have been some confusion as to my gf's reaction, she was ashamed her family dug so deep into me, not about my response. After wanting to die for the next 48 hours she agreed I did the right thing and that it was funny

Backstory: due to my dad's job we lived in Italy for 3 years when I was younger, so I speak Italian almost fluently (it's been awhile, so I've lost some of it)

&#x200B;

Recently I started dating a girl. She's great and I love her so much. I met her family a few nights ago for dinner. She warned me that the male side of her family is very big into being macho, into ""testing"" the boys the women date and are VERY big on taking pride in their Italian ancestry. I think besides the grandfather, however, they were almost all born in Bergen County, NJ but whatever, its nice to take pride in ones heritage.

&#x200B;

Long story short at dinner they kept making jokes at my expense (I honestly would not call it bullying, just things about my height, beard, shaved head). They tried making fun of my IT job too but stopped once I told them my income. It was overall not a bad experience, but a not so pleasant one. Anyways, her older brother kept pushing things, giving me exceptional amounts of shit for playing Lacrosse in HS (apparently its a sport for prissy rich kids and not manly like football or baseball). He ended his rant by saying ""hey, we're just a big Italian family, we're loud and tell it how we see it! Hahaha!"" and all the family except my girlfriend laughed. So I, for the next minute, responded to everything they said in Italian. My girlfriend buried her head in shame, the grandfather laughed and everyone else kept looking at each other confused before telling me they didn't speak Italian. I replied ""then don't use your Italian heritage as an excuse to behave poorly when you can't even speak the language."" They got mad, but the grandfather told them all I was right and to be quiet.

&#x200B;

My girlfriend isn't mad, just ashamed, I think the grandfather likes me, but word from my gf's sister is that all the men are furious, think I'm a smart ass and that I disrespected them and their masculinity in an unforgiveable way. So AITA?",40034,wb88y8,"NTA,

They brought it upon themselves.

They went out of their way to put you down and you defended yourself the best way you could. You have the grandfather's respect for this and mine.

"UPDATE: AITA for ""imposing my culture"" even though I thought I was just being nice?","[Link to original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t622tm/aita_for_imposing_my_culture_even_though_i/)

First of all I just want to thank everyone for the overwhelming support and replies on my first post. I'm looking forward to going over to everyone's houses for dinner and I'll be sure to bring all the things you said you liked :-) many flower lovers out there! I'm now also apparently the DIL to a lot of hopeful parents that replied as well so I hope I can deliver on expectations!

\---

After my last update I told my bf I was sick and tired of him dancing around the issue with his parents and I was going to go over to their house whether he liked it or not. At this point I think he realized that whatever he was doing had backfired so he sat down all angry and told me he'd explain. I sat and he told me that he'd done something very spur of the moment and that he'd texted me from his dad's phone then blocked the number but begged me to listen. That he just needed to get his parents off me for a while and to not leave.

Apparently his parents had started hinting at him about marriage since my bf and I talked a lot about it. I fully expected to marry him as I said in another comment, and was honestly expecting a proposal in late spring since that's when we met. Four years dating didn't bother me but I was getting excited to settle down. However, my bf apparently realized that he absolutely didn't want to commit to anything and wanted to experiment and have fun since I ""wasn't being fun anymore"". Honestly that just made me cry since we were each other's firsts for everything and usually very good at communicating our needs.

His grand plan was to get him mad at me so I would beg for forgiveness and then he'd only accept an open relationship as an answer. Absolutely brilliant plan I know. He'd made up his parents getting mad but didn't expect me to blow off dinner completely and it's like ""hitting a jackpot"", his words not mine. He went over for dinner, hid the flowers and said we'd gotten into a huge fight but he was ""going to fix it"" but I needed space. After he confessed all this he said he was very sorry but really didn't want to miss out on new experiences when he was still young and would I consider an open relationship but pretend ours was strained with his parents so they wouldn't get suspicious?

And.....I laughed. I laughed his ass right out the door and told him absolutely not and to leave me alone while I packed because I wanted to have some new experiences too!!! He never stopped begging me to stay but I left to sleep at a friend's. After calming down for a few days I cemented the breakup and finally, actually went over to his parent's. My ex-bf's dad never even noticed the phone missing but still apologized and his mom was a mess. I did and still love them and will eat dinner there without *him* as often as I can. I won't lie that I'm sad about four years down the drain, but that's life. And if that was my ex's best possible plan then I dodged the bullet by a mile.",38747,tc16mg,"I LOVE that you went over there and filled his parents in on the real story.

UPDATE: AITA for taking my niece to court over a coat?,"Here's the [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/za73bi/aitaa_for_taking_my_niece_to_court_over_a_coat/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

So here is a quick update, since the situation has been resolved.

When my husband got home, I told him what happened and showed him the video.

He asked if I spoke with my BIL and I said no, all my conversations were with my sister. He said that he will take care of it.

Now, a disclaimer: I understand nothing when it comes to insurance claims, and this is what my husband told me/I understood happened.

My husband talked with my BIL, told him exactly what happened and showed him the *prank* video. Then he told him that the coat was insured, we will be filing a claim and submitting the video, and we might have to file charges for the claim (he assured him that we would be dropping the charges, we do not want to send niece to jail).

Then he told him that one of two things might happen: after our insurance pays us, they will come after them. If their insurance pays, their premium will skyrocket. If it doesn't, they might sue them, and might get a lien on their house. 

My BIL asked if there was a way he could pay us without involving insurance, my husband told him that that was what we wanted at first, but that my sister insisted that they will not be paying us back. 

Apparently, my BIL was not in the know, and he was very pissed off at what my niece did, and my sister's response.

So they came to this solution: my niece's car will be sold, and if it doesn't fetch the whole compensation money, she will have to get a job and pay me the whole check untill it is paid off. Also she is grounded for the rest of the school year.

I am thankful for the people who encouraged me to talk with my husband.",38302,zgv9gf,That's a fair outcome that avoids lifetime level consequences for the niece and still stings hard enough to make the point.

AITA for getting upset with my husband after he told me nothing will change while I am pregnant?,"Throwaway account. So me (26f) and my husband (28m), who I'll call ""Jake"" for this story, have been together for 5 years and married for 3. We have recently started trying for a baby as we both felt like that was the next step in our life together, and 3 weeks ago I got a positive test back.  We were really really happy and told our families, and now my mom and MIL want to throw a big baby shower for us, it was just super good news all around. 

Well 2 nights ago me and Jake were getting ready for bed when he reminds me to go through the house and make sure all the lights are off. Now he can be a little lazy at times, and it has become a nightly routine for me to make sure all the lights are off that he leaves on before we go to bed. I wasn't feeling very well and asked if he could just do it since he wasn't doing anything and was literally standing by the door. He then tells me ""No, this is what is expected of you every night."" I was a little hurt but I didn't want to fight with him so I just did it. When I came back Jake goes on this very long and unprovoked rant saying things like ""Just because you are pregnant does not mean anything will change"" and ""You are still expected to cook, clean, and do all the chores every day because how can you be expected to be a mother if you can't handle a little work."" He wasn't yelling or anything, he was talking to me quietly like a was 2 inches tall. 

I was shocked because I had never heard him say anything like this. The rant went on for about 30 minutes before I interjected and asked ""Well what do you plan on doing to help me with all of this."" He then got extremely defensive saying he works his ass of at his job to provide for me and what is going to be our future children. (For context I don't work atm, my job was not paying enough to justify me going so I am a full time college student) He ended by saying that it doesn't matter how I feel physically or mentally, it is a mothers job to push through, and if he helped and babied me I wouldn't be a good mother.

I got extremely upset and started yelling and I said that ""I wish I would've known this is how you felt before I got pregnant with your baby."" There was a moment of silence before he started crying and he left for the night to stay at his mothers house. He hasn't been back yet and my MIL and SIL have called me berating me and saying I broke Jakes heart with what I said and I need to apologize immediately, and until I do he isn't coming home. I don't know how to feel. 

So AITA for yelling at my husband after he said he isn't helping me with anything during the pregnancy because ""its a mothers job to deal with it""?

EDIT: First I want to thank you all for your responses. I'm sorry I haven't really responded to anyone specifically but I really do appreciate you guys. A few of you asked if I told my MIL and SIL what he said, which I did. They basically said I was being sensitive and all he meant was pregnancy isn't an excuse to be lazy, he meant no harm. ......ok. I am getting some things together and am going to be headed to my mom and dads house. My mom is furious with him and doesn't want me apologizing to him or talking to him without the situation either being recorded or having a witness. Regardless, I am ok and will be ok. I do appreciate all of you though, you have opened my eyes to many things I may have been ignoring or looking past over the years.",38263,sgawl2,"NTA.

"AITA for telling my boyfriend's friends I make twice what he does, when they called me a gold digger and he didn't defend me?","I'm in a relationship with a guy who also works in tech. He makes 68k and I make 130k. I am a mechanical engineer at a robotics startup. He works at a more stable job doing programming at a large company. 

He brought me to meet his friends at a party and they asked me about myself. His friends mostly work in tech too and talked about themselves in terms of their jobs.

I told them I'm an hiker, I do archery, I love road trips and camping and riding dirtbikes, etc. Basically talking about my hobbies because work is just a way to get paid to do the shit I love. It's not how I define myself and it doesn't come to mind when someone wants me to tell them about myself. 

One of his friends asked about work and I said ""Oh gosh, I don't wanna talk about work at a party! Spent my whole day sweating my ass off in 95 degree heat trying to replace this busted ass motor just to find the replacement part was also fucked.""

I wasn't lying or trying to downplay that I have a good job, that really is how I spent my day, and I wasn't in the mood to talk shop at a party!  

Some other conversations came up casually that probably also made me seem poorer like me saying that car dealership repairs were a ripoff, and telling my boyfriend that my childhood neighbors trailer caught on fire and I was gonna visit and help her out

I wasn't doing it on purpose, I was literally just talking about my life, but I guess I gave the impression I was poorer

It got later in the night, everyone was getting drunker, and some of his friends (not close ones tho) were making jokes about me growing up in a trailer and being a gold digger. And being ready to jump to a richer guy. Really misogynistic shit honestly, since they don't even know me and seemed to just assume all girls are good diggers.

He didn't say anything. He later said it was because he'd smoked weed and gets quiet and has trouble carrying on a quick conversation when he's high. But regardless I felt hurt he didn't say anything. 

I got irritated with his friends and asked ""Now why the hell would you say that when I make twice what he does?"" His friends went quiet for a second and I continued saying ""There ain't no gold to dig here, not with him or anyone at this party. So do y'all think I'm cheap, or do y'all think I'm stupid? 

My boyfriend wanted to leave the party shortly after and he was pretty upset with me for telling everyone I make twice what he does. I said I would have held my tongue if he'd checked his friends himself. But he didn't say anything so I wasn't about to let them talk to me like that.

He said it was humiliating and now everyone thinks I'm a bitch, and I flippantly said ""at least they know I'm a rich bitch"" 

He was angry I embarrassed him when I spoke up, I was angry I had to say anything at all because his friends were talking shit so it should be on him to check them. Stuff is still tense.

AITA for literally showing my dad how he behaves everyday when he gets home from work?,"My f16 father m46 is the ""breadwinner"" while mom is a sahm. She handles everything around the house like cooking, mopping, washing, laundry, etc. I'm the oldest and I try to help but really there's only so much I can do while my dad just gets home at the end of the day and literally complains about everything. like how the carpet isn't clean or how the food is cold.


As a result; I'd have to listen to a huge argument daily between him and mom. It's exhausting but honestly...I think that my dad is in the wrong here. I tried talking to him to get him to see how his behavior is but to no avail.


So what I did was pick a day off for him and pretend to act like him. I put together an outfit that looked like a suit and put black tape over my lips to look like a mustache. at 6pm. I went inside the house. Shouted ""I'M HOME!!"" then sat next to him in the living room and started kicking my shoes while complaining about the state of the house at the top of my lungs. He glanced at me confused asking what I was doing. I ignored him then started yelling about the carpet being dirty, shower not ready, the kids needing to be quiet and so on.

He kept staring while mom and my siblings laughed. My youngest brother kept pointing towards me saying ""this is daddy"". I then proceeded to yell about dinner then berated my mom for not preparing ut before time. My dad stopped me and in a serious tone asked what I was doing. I turned to him and said ""WHAT?! CAN'T A MAN EFFING REST AFTER WORKING LONG HOURS!!"" in the most macho voice I could muster. My dad got the hint because this was the common phrase he uses daily. He went quiet and avoided looking at me. I stopped the act and told him I was trying to show him what he's like everyday when he comes home from work. He said nothing, just went outside and refused to speak to me.


Later he went on about how I ""mocked"" and invalidated him. That he does work hard and me doing this was disrespectful and invalidating. Mom said it was funny but also thought I hurt my dad's feelings and I could've gotten the message across some other way instead.


AITA?",38012,xe62pq,"NTA first off but I think you have a good chance here.

Listen please - you can acknowledge “Hey dad, I know that probably did hurt your feelings and I’m sorry. Of course you work hard and provide for us and we appreciate it, but I want you to see that your behavior hurts moms feelings, hurts the family.”

The fact he went quiet, instead of exploding in anger, to me says there is hope! Like many, MANY dudes his age he struggles to process those emotions, but he recognized he was feeling more embarrassed / hurt than angry it seems. 

The key is to understand and withhold judgement, to re center the convo on not just his pain, but everyone’s feeling pain, and moving forward.

That’s tough, and you’re a kid, it’s not your responsibility to do it. You would be morally justified to say F off. But I always ask do you wanna win, or be right? 

Being right often feels hallow. I hope you win!

AITA for telling a guy what I do for work and letting him pay for my drinks during the whole evening?,"EDIT TITLE : AITA for NOT telling a guy what I do for work and letting him pay for my drinks during the whole evening?

----

My friend ""Grace"" invited me to a board game bar to play and have drinks with her, her boyfriend and one of their friend's ""Nick"".

We went to get drinks in pairs, Grace going with her boyfriend, meanwhile Nick and I stayed at the table and vice versa. So Nick and I had plenty of time to talk just the two of us. 

Nick started the night by telling about his recent career change, he decided to quit his previous job, go to a coding bootcamp and he got a job as a developer one or two months ago. He was very proud of himself and his new salary and told me this multiple times. 

He never asked me what I do for work, but talked about his new job quite a lot, occasionally saying ""sorry, you don't understand that, haha"". During the entire evening, I never told him I has been working as a software engineer for the past 4 years, because he never asked and honestly, I found it a bit entertaining. 

When it came to the drinks, he invited me to every single one. ""Don't worry about it, it's not a problem with my devoper salary."" I told him multiple times he doesn't have to pay for me, but he insisted. 

At the end of the night, when we were saying our goodbyes, he took out his phone to send me a friend request on Facebook. My job is listed in my profile, so that was when he realized that I'm software engineer. 

He asked me if it's true that I'm a software engineer and I answered yes. He asked me why I haven't told him, why did I let him believe I was a cashier like Grace used to be (?? I never implied that), and why did I let him pay for everything when I probably earn more than him. 

I told him that he never once asked and it was his fault he assumed. He could have simply asked me about my job, but he only wanted to brag about his. But if he wants me to, I can pay him back for the drinks. 

He was a angry and said I made a fool out of him. I think he did that, not me. But now Grace and her boyfriend are on his side too, saying that it would've cost me nothing to tell him early in the evening and I only kept it for myself for my own entertainment. 

Well, I did find it entertaining, but I don't really feel like I did anything wrong. AITA?",37672,uzip5a,"Nick was bragging. You played along with it.

AITA for moving my son into a rental apartment after finding out that his dad's been cancelling his job applications?,"
My son ""Aiden"" (23) moved back in with us upon graduating college as my husband wanted. My husband's original plan was to have Aiden live with us for free, but stay home and help with his disabled younger brother (16). Aident started complaining about needing money and wanted to find a job. My husband was against this and even offered to double his allowance but Aiden was growing tired of staying at home.


So he began looking for jobs here and there for over a year but non of his job applications came through. He'd just apply and they never get back to him. We were confused by this til recently, I found out that my husband was behind all the job applications being cancelled. He'd wait tol Aiden applies then he proceeds to cancel the application by impersonating him and using his email. I blew up at him for this but his justification is that he's just trying to make sure that our younger son is cared for by Aiden and said that Aiden has been big help and him getting a job will affect his care for his brother. I went ahead and rented an apartment for Aiden and told him to stay there til he finds a job and starts paying for it himself. Aiden was hurt upon knowing what his dad did. My husband was livid when he found out. He called me unhinged and said that I was separating the boys and teaching Aiden to become selfish and care more about a job than family. He also said it was huge decision for me to rent an apartment without even running it with him.


He's been giving me hell about it and is calling me a terrible mother for encouraging Aiden to be selfish and selfcentered. He said I needed to see and understand why he did what he did.


[Edit] few things to mention:

(1) My husband says that since he and I have health issues then we could use Aiden's help.

(2) When I suggested outside help, my husband refused saying he won't ask anything from anybody and that his son is his problem and no body else's.

(3) I used money from our joint account to pay for the rental apartment. My husband said it was wrong and that it was a major waste of money since we deal with medical bills consistenly.",37568,103y282,"NTA.

AITA for refusing to punish or allow my wife to punish our son?,"This all started back in March. My son's best friend turned thirteen. In his family, thirteenth birthday is a huge deal. In addition to a massive party (which all four of us were invited to) his parents also took him to Disney World. They invited my son to attend as well.

My wife was hesitant to consent to this. She said it was unfair to allow our son to go when our nine year old daughter can't. Especially since she loves Disney and princesses. I said that our kids won't always have the exact same opportunities, and if we set a precedent here, we'll have to stick to it if and when our daughter gets a similar opportunity. So we'd just be punishing both our children needlessly. My wife reluctantly agreed that we should allow our son to go.

I gave our son money to buy his sister souvenirs. He did, and his friend's parents even bought extra stuff for him to give to her. Still, when she saw him come back wearing a Star Wars shirt with the Mickey hat and trading pin lanyard, she burst into tears. My wife later said we made a huge mistake and never should have let him go.

I (mistakenly) thought all of that was behind us. Now, we are not well off financially, but my BiL is, and he invited all of us to visit a beach house he rented for a summer send-off. My wife told me she wants to have our son stay with my dad and just take out daughter to ""even the score.""

I told my wife that isn't happening. We are their parents. We can't favor one child over the other. Not being invited to the birthday trip of a kid you barely know is in no way comparable to being left out of a *family vacation* and I'm shocked she would even suggest such a thing. I refuse to allow it. Now my wife is angry, but I don't care. I'm not punishing my son for being lucky. AITA?",37210,wcnh0v,"NTA. Die on this hill. You were 100% correct that your kids aren't going to receive the same opportunities in life. Daughter has to learn how to handle situations like this in life, because she's  not always going to be treated the same or have the same opportunities as everyone around her and she needs to learn to handle that with grace.

Also this is your family inviting you like you said, not a child's friend. Your wife would be excluding your son from his entire family, which is just awful. Let your wife be angry about this, she's completely out of line. What a strange reaction. I wonder what the root of it really is.

We get to the airport and Becky got 7 other people first class tickets and me 1 coach ticket.  She told me I was used to it and she had a free coach ticket so I should be grateful for going. They all did their express check ins and left me in the long line for me to think about what the heck is going on. I had to keep from crying the whole time in line. I got up to the counter and there was a baggage fee to me. My boyfriend at the time never once helped me through the coach line or said anything to his mom.

"AITA for doing weird/awkward poses whenever my MIL ""accidently"" walks in on me in the bathroom?","So, my MIL (I'm a gal btw lol) came to stay with us for few weeks til her home is renovated for christmas.


The problem is that she has been randomly walking in on me while I'm in the bathroom. Thankfully not once has she seen me naked because I started picking up on her behavior after the second time in a week.


She'd barge in, then turns and says ""oh sorry"" then close the door. I tried talking to my husband about it but he kept ignoring me then flatout said ""so what if she accidently seen you naked? She's faaaammmillly!!"". He seriously said that!.


We have a lock and I could've used it but I have past trauma from the idea of locking/being locked in a room after my brother locked me in the bathroom when I was 5.

So I came up with this idea. I'd go inside the bathroom pretending to use it and wait for her to come (cause honestly? It's deliberate at the this point). When she ""accidently"" barges in she'd see me in a weird/awkward position. For example doing a ballet stand, standing on the toilet, or standing facing the wall with my hands up, (fully clothed of course). I could see how awkward and weird this would be for her because she'd stand there for few seconds trying to figure out what I was doing. It was halirious at first seeing her initial confusion but she told my husband about it claiming ""she's caught me practicing rituals in the bathroom"". I cleared things up and revealed the reason why. My husband was livid. He called me childish and said that I made his mom feel ""terrified/weirded out"" by my behavior. He said I should've acted maturely and locked the damn door instead of playing mind games.


Edit. Lol. Um what? I just came back on here and saw literally 1000s? of people? OMG now I feel embarrassed Glad I went anonymous Lol. But seriously...I'm looking at my screen and am like ....I'm famous? Seriously though...My husband and his mom are extremely upset with me. He still thinks it was ridiculous and is demanding an apology before she goes back to her home.  I'm not sure if I will apologize because yes while it was a ""me problem"" that I couldn't use the lock. It's still feels wrong what she did and maybe I'm wrong too but at least I got (so did you apparently lol) a bit of a chuckle out of it 😅🤣 also, I'm sure Thanksgiving dinner will hella awkward tomorrow.

AITA for embarrassing my FIL after I repeatedly asked him to explain his joke to me?," I (27F) used to be an ''*escort*'' (h\*oker) from 18 until I was 23, I'm not proud of it but I also don't give a fuck because I did what I had to do to keep studying and a roof over my head. That's how I met my now fiancé (37M) tho he was never my client.

We began to date when I was 25 and three or four months after that his BIL ''exposed me'' (no idea how he found out) because *there's no way my fiancé knew* and thus we had to come clean in front of his whole family. Yes I did that. Yes he knows. Yes he doesn't care. It was 2 years ago (at that time), we got over it. After that there was a span of 3-4 months in were my MIL and some of my fiancés aunts and cousin ''police'' their husband when I was around, it was really weird tbh because this dudes were like 40-60yo and I wasn't that desperate, so my fiancé shut their bullshit hard and even when his family still gives me the side eye from time to time, we thought it was behind us.

He proposed last year and five months ago we found out that I was pregnant, we were really happy about it and we told his family as soon as we knew. His sisters and young brother were happy for us, but his mom took me aside and *begged* me to be honest with her and asked if this was really my fiancés child, I was taken aback but I just rolled my eyes and said yes, she gave me some shitty speech about how ''she only wanted to make sure'' and that ''she was happy to be a grandmother''.

Well, last weekend we were at his parents with his family and some of his friendsand we were talking about the name, how he might look (small talk, we will love him regardless but there's always some ''*Oh I hope he gets your nose!*'' ''*mmh I like your eyes, I hope he gets them*'' comments) and my FIL said that he and his children have a birthmark in the inner tight and that even his grandchildren (one of my SIL's kids) got them, so our baby might too, and then he said ''But how can we know from who he got it? it may as well be from me, my boy or my brothers'' and he and his brothers began to laugh. My fiancé got mad and before he could say anything I said ''I don't get it'' and my FIL was ''yeah because it runs in the family'' and I said again ''I don't get it, why would he get it from you?'' and he began to get nervous and said ''because you know... it's just a joke OP'' and I said ''but I don't get it and you all laughed, explain'' it got to the point that some of his friends said ''hey, it's not funny'' so he he excused himself and left. 

Later my fiancé's BIL came to me and said that I was wrong for embarrassing him like that in his own house and that I knew what the joke was about and *because of my past*, I shouldn't be surprised.

I fit in one but my side is usually touching the person next to me and I feel uncomfortable for them. It happened to me that they gave me nasty looks and I felt extremely uncomfortable the whole flight. 

So I sat down in the plane and put the armrest up so I would be really comfortable. Some couple came and they both sat next to me because they got separate seats and they noticed the seat next to me was empty. Exactly what I was afraid of happened. My side kept touching the guy next to me and he even pushed me a bit when he moved in the seat. I was feeling extremely uncomfortable and asked him if he could go to his seat because I bought this one for my comfort. He told me no, since the seat is empty and he wants to be with his girlfriend. Well, I told him I understand but I feel uncomfortable and I paid for the second seat so exactly this doesn't happen. He refused again and started to chat with his GF. I called the flight attendant and quietly told her what is happening. She asked the guy to leave my second seat and he and his GF gave me a nasty look.

I've only ever stayed at my dad's on weekends so it's been hard getting used to living with his gf and her kid full time.

Today gf was taking her daughter on a ""special outing"" because she passed a math test, and my dad suggested I go with them for a ""girls day out"".

AITA for telling my parents that they ruined NY celebration after they kicked my husband out over a joke?,"
I've been married to my 2nd Husband ""Mike"" for 4 years now. He's a jokester and loves to crack jokes all the time. He especially like to joke with my brother ""Ethan"" and his wife. Ethan used to be okay with it til he started complaining about Mike taking it too far with his jokes.


Some context about Ethan. He and his wife couldn't have kids so they adopted a boy ""Joey"" 2 years ago. Mike has been making silly, lighthearted jokes that involving Joey's bio parents as a way to mess with Ethan and his wife. I already talked to Mike and I tell you that he's 100%means no harm and he was just trying to get them to react.


So fast forward to NYE, my parents hosted a big celebratory dinner and Ethan and his wife came. While we were eating dinner, Mike decided to tell a knock-knock joke to Ethan. He said ""Knock knock.."" Ethan laughed and said ""Who's there?"". Mike replied ""Joey's bio parents"" then he bursted out laughing. Silence took over and Ethan's facial experssions changed. His wife called Mike an ""idiot"" to which Mike replied with ""Hey...Relax it was just a joke"". An argument ensued and dinner was paused. My parents suddenly told Mik to leave which I thought was too harsh. I tried to speak to them and get them to calm down but mom insisted that Mike leave. We left and Mike was complaining the whole time about how they overreacted. I called mom later and she told me Mike was out of line with his hurtful jokes about this touchy topic and told me I was wrong for defending him and saying he was just joking. She said he ruined NY for the family but I told her it was her and dad who ruined NY celebration for escalating the situation and kicking him out. I told her he could talk to them but again they were the ones who ruined NY celebration. She called me delusional for this statement and hung up.

What if someone took your greatest insecurity and poked at it. Over and over and over and over again. Like some shitty, hurtful groundhog day. 

And when you said something about it, they would tell you ""Well, calm down, it's a joke.""

AITA flipping out on my fiance for cancelling all the vegan food options from our wedding food menu behind my back?,"

My fiance (31 male) and I (25 female) are getting married soon. There wasn't much that disagreed on during the wedding planning except for food. Me and my family are vegans, and there so many reasons why we chose this lifestyle and one of them being that we have a history of health issues. My fiance and his family are the complete opposite. they're hardcore meat eaters which is fine by me obviously.

However, When deciding on the wedding food menu, I wanted to add 4-5 vegan options. My fiance and his mom objected saying it was a waste of money over food that 'isn't real food'. They also argued that this would be offensive for 'their' guests and suggested my vegan options just be ""the good ol' salads & appetizers"" (his mom wanted cupcakes lol). I said no because for one it's me and my family who's paying. and two I want to make my guests feel welcome and not be treated as second class citizens by being served ""salad"". my fiance made a face and said ""isn't that what vegans eat?"". I refused to argue about it and said it was final.


The other day, I found out that he had cancelled all the vegan options and took them off the menu completely and behind my back. I was seething. I called him at work but he kept hanging up on me. I went straight to his workplace and confronted him there and just flipped out on him. He was stunned to see me. He at first said it was his mom's idea then told me to go home because I was making a scene at the office. the fight continued at home and he defended himself by saying that I sort of made him resort to doing this after I kept brushing off his thoughs and input, and refusing to accommadate his family. but there were PLENTY of meat options why why can't I get 4-5 vegan options? when I'm paying for it?. He yelled that it was his wedding too not my family's. My family said it was fine and they'll figure it out and told me to let it go but I refused.


AITA for putting my foot down on this?

UPDATE: So his mom messaged me earlier to try to get me to listen to what she had to say after I kept ignoring her phonecalls. She spent long walls of text just to ""address"" what I did at her son's workplace, calling it all kinds of stuff from immature to unhinged. She then went to explain how she's noticed that me and my family kept ""acting dismissive"" of her son's input and ""contributations"" to the wedding. She said that she noticed my behavior towards him and her entire family and wanted to speak up earlier but didn't and tried to keep the peace. She then went on to address the food menu issue and denied her involvement in the cancellation of the vegan option but that didn't mean she doesn't support her son's decision. moreover, she thought it was soooo responsible of him to make that move because of my continual refusal to see how this stuff is waste of money. she also pointed out how I kept saying ""I paid for it"" and said that technically this isn't just my money, it's mine and *his* because we're getting married she suggested I wisen up and get rid of ""my money, I paid for it"" mentality. She finally mentioned how ""bad"" this whole situation is making me look, and said that she and her son had already offered a number of compromises that I chose to brush off and decided to make it my ""weird"" hill to die on. She said that not only her son is upset but she and ""the family"" are as well after hearing about it and suggested I just agrre on their compromise and be done with it.

AITA for taking my newborn son and going to my mom's house because my husband his mom didn't save me any food for dinner?,"



I f32 gave birth to my son 5 weeks ago. My husband's mom has been camping in the living room ever since and inviting people over, making a mess in the house, etc. I said nothing because if I open my mouth, my husband would start scolding me saying his mom is there to help and I should be grateful. What I did was ignore her and focus on my son.

I handle feeding, diaper change, cleaning, wiping. I only get a few hours sleep so my husband's mom isn't really helping with the baby. But I thought to myself ""well, at least she cooks for us!"".


Last night, I was in the bedroom breastfeeding my son. I knew I was late for dinner but I thought that my husband and his mom saved a plate for me. Once I got done with my son, I walked out the room and saw my husband and his mom sitting watching tv. I asked about dinner and my husband said it was ""probably"" on the stove. As I was walking towards the kitchen, his mom loudly said that she didn't save me any food. I was absolutely shocked I asked her why and she simply said ""Well, we didn't see you at dinner table so I thought you weren't hungry"". I lost it and yelled that I was feeding my son OF COURSE I was hungry, I was actually starving!. She shrugged her shoulders and said it wasn't her fault I didn't ""show up for dinner"" but she knew damn well that I was with my son and hadn't eaten a thing in hours!. My husband asked me to not raise my voice at his mom but I told him that he saw what happened and didn't think about me being hungry and needing food. he lashed out asking what the fuck I wanted him to do and I said ""I don't know, maybe save some food for me?"" She defended him saying it was selfish of me to basically berate him for eating his dinner after working for long hours at the department. An argument ensued and I went inside the bedroom, packed a small bag for me and my son, called my brother to come take me to mom's house and my husband blew up at me as I was making my way out. We argued at the door and he told me that what I was doing was uncalled for and childish. I told him I couldn't take his mom anymore, he said I should be ashamed of myself for talking about her like that after she literally put her life ""on pause"" so she could help ME out. My brother came and I got into the car and left.


He picked some food for me on the way and I ate like a hungry bear. My husband never stopped calling though. In his last text he called me ""nuts"" and demanded I return today but I said that I miss my mom, that I like it here in her clean home with her healthy food and would like to stay for a while. He's lost it and got his family involved accusing me of keeping his son away from him and punishing him over ""food"".



**Edit...Ok, to those who are saying that I'm keeping my husband away from his son, I promise you that he has full access to him but chooses not to come over simply because he hats my mom and refuses to be with her in the same room. How long am I going to stay here??? There's no telling but at least I'm being pampered and treated like a princess by my mom, dad, brothers - heck, I couldn't get this treatment in my own home!. As for my husband, He can come over to mom's house if he wants to see his son so badly but I doubt he'll do it since he's a very prideful person and this might hurt his ego.**


**one more question to answer cause a lot of people asked me to clarify. Yes, Department = Police Department. He's a police officer. I'm sorry if you got confused, but I thought it was clear.**








**Edit Ok, I felt sorry for him and decided to send him a couple of pictures that I took of our son sleeping and what was his respons? A long wall of text berating me left and right and claiming that I was rubbing it in his face that he ""can't come"" see his son because of you know what!!. He called me the b word which he never did til now and I'm shaken and so so mad right now because I really thought I was doing something nice and considerate after having sympathy for him. I've decided to get the rest of my stuff tomorrow because I need more time and space to be able to think about what he's done and said. I feel terrible right now but at least I got dinner for tonight, unlike when I was at my own home when his mom first came**


**Edit. OH MY GOD, I can't even find a place to start with this. So he just sent me a picture of him and his mom cooking dinner in the kitchen (it's nearly 7 pm here) saying that he was repaying me for the pictures I sent earlier and that they were making dinner and they were not including me ""for real this time"" ?????? I just....Oh my God I'm literally laughing like, seriously, what is this? I'm truly speechless!. I haven't responded to this (yet) and I don't think I will because I'm so angry right now and may just regret the words that I say to him. I'm gonna put the phone on silent or something for now because I don't want them to ruin yet another night but tomorrow I'm going to collect more of mine and my son's stuff so I could stay longer at my mom's house. Thank God I went anonymous with this and I might update later if anything new happens. Goodnight!**


**Edit. God I can't believe I'm back on here, but he just sent me a text saying he's only willing to come over IF I could get mom out of the house tomorrow, like literally have her leave her own house! He said it's just for 2 hours so he could see his son and also ""talk"" (he doesn't even know I'm coming over tomorrow to pick more stuff for me and the baby). I'm freaking out! Like absolutely no, not happening. I wouldn't dream of telling mom to leave her own house, that's crazy out of line request!!!. I'm not sure wether to respond or what I should say to him but I'll try to get some sleep then see how it goes in the morning!. I'm too tired to do anything but I Just wanted to put this here for those who just read my thread, I'll let you know what happens tomorrow.

Update: AITA for not making coffee how my fiance wants me to,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/nhzub1/aita_for_not_making_coffee_how_my_fiance_wants_me/)

So it's been about a year since I made this post. Whenever I read posts like mine on here, I'm always wondering, did OP leave that asshole, so for those of you who care, I left that asshole.

A lot of you were on the nose that this wasn't the only way that he was controlling. My ex believes that he's the smartest person in the room, so if you're doing something differently than how he would, then you're doing it wrong and must be corrected.

I'm not saying that everyone's responses to my post gave me a revelation and I immediately knew what I had to do, but it was a nail in the coffin.

I'm living within an hour of my parents now when before I was on the opposite side of the country. I have a job as a caregiver and am planning to go to grad school to be a social worker. I have a boyfriend who doesn't try to control every aspect of my life. When I go grocery shopping, I'm not stressing about accidentally buying the wrong brand of pasta (which was the right brand of pasta when we lived in a different state, I still don't get that) or juice that's from concentrate. And I've switched to pre-ground coffee because fuck you, I want to. None of this would've happened if I'd stayed with him.

So yeah, thank you to everyone who played a tiny role in helping me see what an unhealthy relationship I was in.",34850,ux172q,"Pre-ground coffee???

AITA for leaving my babies inside by themselves,"I (20) am a mother of triplets whom are only 2 months old. I never expected ever in my life that I'd be a mother to triplets so when I first became pregnant it was definitely the last thing in my mind. 

I'm home with my babies all day long and had to even transfer my education to online. 

Sometimes I just need some fresh air especially when I can't get them to stop crying and I find myself getting super frustrated to the point of tears, it's honestly soo hard and the dad isn't here to help as he's ether at work or at school.
My fiance's (24) parents rented us a main floor apartment so when I step outside I'm literally just sitting on the chair right beside the door plus I have a baby monitor step up in their room and it has a camera on it I can literally see them and hear them so if anything happened I'd be able to quickly get to them. 

Being able to step outside for a few minutes to take a breather is really important to me because I start to have mini panic attacks when I can't get them to stop crying and I get really frustrated because I just feel super overwhelmed, Being able to go outside just gives me a chance to clam down. 

My fiance came home to me sitting outside while the babies were crying and freaked out on me calling me a horrible mom and a bunch of other names that I'm not gonna list here. He thinks that I was being super neglectful and putting the babies in harm way and even told his parents and now everyone seem to be really against me. 

I grow up in the system my fiance's family is the only family I have and ever known so it breaks my hurt that they are so upset with me but I really don't think I was doing anything wrong or putting my babies in harm way but they seems to think otherwise.

So here I am wondering if I should apologize for my actions or if I am the A-hole in this situation.

~~~~~~~~~ Update ~~~~~~~~~

I decided to show my fiance this thread at first he was really upset with me for sharing our personal problems with strangers on the internet even though it's anonymous. 

But in the end when he had a chance to clam down and hear me and all of you guys out he actually apologized and promised me he'd be more involved with parenting and even is willing to take parenting classes which I'll hold him to that. 

I just wanna thank everyone for the support that you all give me it brought tears to my eyes (happy tears) seeing how supportive you all were to a stranger on the internet I don't think I ever received this much support before. 

I can't believe how much attention this post even got plus the award again thank you so much.",34483,109i1ro,"The whole purpose of the baby monitor is so that you can leave the babies in a room on their own. Being just outside the apartment door is no big deal (says a grandmother)

It sounds like you are overwhelmed. You need some help with the babies from time to time. Either the father needs to be home more or his family should help out. One baby is a lot, three have you completely outnumbered.

AITA For skipping Christmas with my parents since they won't treat me like an adult?,"I (F27) have been with my boyfriend (33) for almost two years now.  We will be getting married eventually but it's not a priority. 

My mom won't let us share a bed if we come see them for any reason.  When we came over this last summer my boyfriend suggested renting a hotel so we could have privacy and a comfortable bed. It drove my mom nuts that we bypassed her ittle rules.  She wouldn't drop it the entire time we were there.  She made me promise not to do that again.  

My boyfriend's mom and dad are retired to Mexico and they are really chill. So we made plans to come visit them over Christmas.  They are not Christian so they don't really care when they see their son with regards to religious holidays.  

We didn't tell my parents we weren't coming. My mom asked me at Thanksgiving if I was going to hold to my promise not to stay at a hotel over Christmas.  I answered truthfully that I would not stay at a hotel.  

I am sitting here on the balcony of my future in-laws condo looking at the Carribean waiting for sunrise and enjoying the peace and quiet.  I made the mistake of going online yesterday and I saw a bunch of posts from my mom and my sisters about how I was a jerk for lying to them about my plans.  

I may have been a little tipsy last night because I decided to respond.  I said that it was ridiculous of them to try and tell me I couldn't share a room with my boyfriend, that I was keeping my promise by not staying at a hotel when we were there, and that if they planned on putting everything on Facebook I would be avoiding all visits for the foreseeable future.  

They took down their posts when people started crapping on them for trying to control me.  But some people did agree with them. 

Now they are texting me and calling to say I was an asshole for making them look bad.  I asked them if they were trying to make me look good with their posts?  They stopped for a while but there were more texts and voice mail this morning.   I'm kind of liking the idea of skipping out on the drama from now on. But I miss my dad and he is blameless in this. 

AITA?

#EDIT

I'm having trouble wrapping my head around a couple of things that keep being repeated.  

1. How was staying at a hotel so we didn't break her rules not the adult choice?

2. How many of you guys fly across the country or drive for hours to just stay one night?",34044,zux4ny,"NTA.  Sorry to hear about your crappy situation!

I am seeing a bunch of comments about you needing to act like an adult, say what you mean, etc.  Life isn’t so cut and dried as all that.  I do agree that, maybe, that is one potential end goal.  There are lots of possible good pathways to follow, and only you know which one works for you personally, and for your specific circumstances.  

My guess is, you felt that you were faced with a few choices:  

1) Go to your family’s gathering, get treated like a child, stay in separate rooms, endure the oppressive environment for the duration.
2) Go to your family’s gathering, stay in a hotel, get treated like a villain, endure the ensuing shit storm.
3) Tell your family you are skipping Christmas with them this year in favour of your in-laws and endure the ensuing shit storm leading up to the holidays - get treated like a villain.
4) Do what you did - spend the holidays with respectful people in a wonderful setting, get treated like a villain by your family, feel some guilt about the deception by omission.

You took a step towards establishing limits with your family.  Hooray!  Good job 👍 Boundaries are awesome!  My guess is your family will not like the change and will rage against it, will try to make you believe your actions were not mature.  Keep going!  Time will tell what degree of contact with them appropriate FOR YOU, and what / when / how much you can safely share with them.

Good luck, sorry for the long ramble, and happy holidays!",24,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zux4ny/aita_for_skipping_christmas_with_my_parents_since/
AITA for my reaction when I learned that my fiance returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom picked for me?,"My fiance M33, and I F28 are getting married in december. His mom is the intrusive type but she's nice overall and we....somewhat get along.


I hate to admit that wedding planning has been an absolute nightmare. His mom wasn't willing to agree on most things, and my fiance said that since he's her only son then I should respect and appreciate this ""vision"" she has for the wedding and how it should be.


She insisted to come along for wedding dress shopping. I took her with me and my mom and friends. I was so lucky to have found what I was looking for. but she picked a dress that she liked so much and said that ""she always pictured her son's bride in it"" mom and friends thought this line was creepy. I thought the dress was somewhat creepy and toooootally not my type. I apologized and thanked her for her ""vision"" but told her that I'd already decided on a dress that I had ""envisioned"" myself wearing at my wedding!.


She got all pissy because of it apparently, then must've told my fiance because, he came home in the evening ranting about how I made his mom upset and ""turned down"" her help in choosing the wedding dress and excluded her from the process. I asked ""what process?"" duh it's just a wedding dress...my wedding dress so I really didn't get how she should get a say at all!. He got upset and said that this attitude of mine isn't working on him or his mom. He said that I should consider the dress his mom wanted me to buy especially knowing that ""both dresses weren't that much different anyway"" like she said but I told him yes they were different...like so much different.


Anyways, We argued about it then we dropped it. Yesterday I came home and found out that he had returned my wedding dress and replaced it with the one his mom wanted. I called him and he was straightforward about what he did and why he did it. I lost it and started screaming at him. He asked me to calmn down and really give this dress ""a chance"". I refused to even listen I screamed at him without giving him a chance to speak. He got home and we had an argument. I then went to stay with one of my friends and he kept calling and calling then texting saying that I overreacted and it's his wedding too so it wasn't cool how I screamed at him. He insisted I give this dress a chance. He went on and on about how his mom has a ""vision"" and good intentions and just wants what best for me as her future daughter inlaw.


Mom is livid and has been wanting to go scream at him and his mom but my dad said that this isn't worth ruining my relationship with my inlaws. He suggested I wisen up and ""go with the flow"" but is it too much for me to be able to pick my own wedding dress without being guilted about it just to keep the peace?. AITA for my reaction?

ETD Q & As

I'm editing in some answers to frequent questions I get.

A. The dress she picked wasn't all too crazy but just wasn't my type.

B. This issue started during wedding planning and there were other things...like way too many things we didn't agree on. but this ""vision"" has been there for...quite a while.

C. I AM paying for the dress obviously.

D. My fiance's dad is deceased. also, his mom suffered from multiple health conditions. Has no daughters but one only son.

E. He's still presisting...",33974,xly6yk,Your dad is wrong. This *is* worth ruining the relationship over. Marry him and get a lifetime of being treated this way. Is that what you want? NTA,1441,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xly6yk/aita_for_my_reaction_when_i_learned_that_my/
AITA for doing the same thing to my sister-in-law that she does to my son?,"So background: I (32f) have a brother, ""Dave"" (35m), who's married to ""Sarah"" (29f). They don't have children yet. I have a son who just turned four and a three-month-old daughter with my husband (39m). My husband and I live in Belgium most of the time, but we travel back to visit my family about once a month (in England). At home, we speak both English and French to our children (my husband is Belgian), and right now, my son is in this very sweet phase where he'll sometimes mix up the two languages and say a couple of words in English in a French sentence or vice-versa. This has never posed a problem to us, and even the staff at his nursery have reassured us that it's very common and they tend to grow out of it once they start at school.

My sister-in-law has decided that this is a problem, so when we're visiting my parents and she notices my son doing this, she'll correct him, but she does so really rudely, whereas my husband and I will just gently correct him.

Anyway, we're visiting at the moment and she's now decided that instead of correcting him, she's just going to start ignoring him when he does this. I sort of noticed her doing it when we arrived, and I thought it was odd, but assumed maybe she was just stressed (her job is quite intense), but it only really became an issue yesterday. My husband was talking to my dad outside and I was feeding my daughter in the other room, and I'd left Louis with Sarah and Dave. When I came back downstairs, Louis was crying, and I managed to understand that he'd tried to ask Sarah for a drink (he has a special cup he uses that he was holding, so it was obvious what he meant) but that she'd just ignored him. I asked her why and she explained that she wasn't going to reply to him unless he said the sentence correctly and that I shouldn't be ""ignoring my son's obvious speech issues."" For context, it's not that she didn't know what he wanted. She told me that she understood exactly what he was asking for, but that she was deliberately refusing because he hadn't asked correctly.

This really pissed me off, but luckily my husband came inside at that moment and pulled me away so we could calm down and settle Louis. That night at the dinner table, Sarah asked me to pass her something, but she said it in ""bad"" English (she IS English, I just mean that she asked for it in slang. Think, ""Pass *us* the peas, will you"". I had a bit of an epiphany and I just decided to totally ignore her. She asked again, and I did the same thing. My brother asked why I was ignoring his wife and I said that I'm not able to reply if she can't speak English correctly and that it's wrong of him to ignore her obvious issues with grammar.

Everyone's pretty pissed off with me and I admit it was incredibly childish, but she was needlessly being a dickhead to my baby.

Should I just apologise?

**Edit: WOW this really blew up. Thanks for all the comments and support, and thanks for all the ESH/YTA messages too. I'm not going to apologise to her, because, to be quite frank, I think she deserved it, but I will have a conversation with her and my brother before we leave to try and explain that, for one thing, it's completely normal, and, more importantly, that if she keeps correcting or ignoring my son, I'll be severely limiting their contact. Although I doubt if I'll ever leave him alone in a room with her again anyway.**

**To answer a few of the most common questions: When I said everyone was mad at me, I meant my brother, his wife and my parents (although, my parents don't agree with what Sarah's doing either. They're more trying to ""keep the peace""). My husband is entirely on my side, and when he realised what Sarah had done to Louis (he only saw the aftermath), he wanted to cut short the trip.**

**Sarah (and the rest of my family), only speak English, which I suppose goes some way towards explaining why she doesn't understand it. I do think it's a monolingual reaction because we've never experienced anything similar in Belgium.**

**One final thing - lots of questions about why we're in the UK so often. My husband has to be in London for his job about once a month/ once every six weeks, so we tag along. I freelance, and a few of my clients are UK based, so it's a good opportunity for me to fit in a few meetings too. It also gives us the chance to bring Louis and Misha over to see my parents before Louis starts school, and we have to cut down on the visits.**",33722,xxznvl,NTA… this is genius and I love it. I speak 3 languages and grew up learning them. At age 3 I interspersed words of all the languages and got my lowest grade ever (in nursery school) because my nursery teacher was like Sarah.

AITA for refusing to ''see other options'' for a girl and pressing charges for what she did to my son's car?,"My (39M) son (17M) Bryce dated our neighbor Lana (17F) for a year, they broke up mid Jan for reasons I don't know. I won't sugarcoat this, I never liked Lana, she always seem a little unhinged, controlling and aggressive, she's always demanding Bryce's attention and there were quite a few times when she showed up on our house our of nowhere (whether it was 7am or 11pm) because Bryce wasn't answering his phone, screaming and calling him a cheater when it wasn't like that. The thought of our son getting abused by his gf made us worried so much.

My wife and I tried to talk him out of that relationship, we said how that it wasn't normal nor healthy, we didn't want to force the break up because we feared Lana would lash out to him so we tried to do it in an sneaky way, we don't know if it worked but they ended up breaking up. 

He said that after he broke up with her Lana didn't contacted him which was weird because he expected her to go nuts but I told him that if fate didn't gave him shit he better not tease it. Now the problem is that we bought my son a car for Christmas, nothing fancy but enough to get him to school, his job and eventually college, he parks it in our driveway outside our home. Ever since the month began we had been founding scratches all over the car, we know Lana was doing it but since it was minimal my son decided to not do anything even if we could prove that it was her (we've CCTV). Still, something smell bad for me so I decided to switch one of the cameras facing his car directly just in case. 

Well, two weeks ago we got up and we found my son's car covered in a lot of shit: paint, glue, feathers, confetti, the door handles were wrecked, flat tires, paint all over the windows, you get the picture, Bryce and my wife were so distraught. We called the police and I handled them the CCTV that showed Lana and her brother (23M) destroying my son's car. We pressed charges and needles to say, Lana's brother went straight to jail, but since she's still a minor her parents want to make a deal but I refused. I don't think she should get a way out, before the police was here she was laughing her ass off and she tried to play it cool, if she thought this was funny then she's old enough to face the consequences. My wife and I want to stand our ground, they said they'll buy my son a better car and put Lana on therapy but is not enough. AITA?",33506,t2z9oa,"NTA

AITA for cancelling the entire trip after finding out that my husband hid my daughter's passport?,"
My husband and I have been together for 3 years. He has 3 kids from his previous relationship and I have one. She's the oldest (17). He's a dedicated man, puts God first and loves everyone.


My husband always complains that my daughter doesn't spend time with her stepsiblings or him but she has reasons for that and that is school, health issues and work. She does her best to spend as much time with them as she can. but she on the other hand complains that her stepdad tells her to basically take on the role of a babysitter whenever she's with her stepsiblings. My husband denied that and said that my daughter was making up excuses to not have to spend time with his kids.


For this issue, I figured that a family trip is what the family need to get together and spend more time around each others. My husband liked the idea but said that his kids are now ""uncomfortable"" around my daughter because of her ""attitude"" and suggested we let her stay home and have the house all to herself since that's ""what she always wanted"". I told him it's best that we all go. he kept complaing til I snapped and told him to stop


I booked (paid) for the whole family. However, my daughter told me she couldn't find her passport. We turned the house upside down looking for it but couldn't find it. My husband said maybe it was a sign from God that we should let her stay home so the trip wouldn't turn into a disaster. I ignored his comment but later while I was cleaning his office I found the passport, tucked away in the 3rd drawer under a ton of papers. I was floored by this, I confronted him with it and he swore he had no idea why or how the passport got there. I checked the upstairs camera and saw him enter my daughter's room. That was it for me, I screamed my head off at him then cancelled the whole trip completely. He started arguing saying I overreacted and that he didn't want his kids to be ""miserable"" on the trip and that willing to apologize to my daughter if and *when* I reconsider my decision regarding the cancellation of the trip, because my stepkids will be devastated but I said it was final and that it was done.


He become cold and distant and said that he wants to take some time to do some fasting and get guidance from God about how he should deal with the disrespect and control I had displayed lately.


AITA for cancelling it altogether?",33487,xe09ej,"NTA.

If your husband wants to take this issue to God, allow me to help him get started.

""Lying lips are abomination to the LORD . . ."" Proverbs 12:22

""Thou shalt not steal."" Exodus 20:15

He stole from your daughter and he lied about it. Now he is trying to fault you for ""disrespect"" and ""control""?

What about the disrespect he showed to you and your daughter? What about the control he displayed by deliberately trying to exclude your daughter from a family vacation, and lying about it? What about the disrespect he showed your daughter, presuming to decide for her that she would prefer to stay home from the family vacation? (Which, let's face it, was the ostensible reason. It wasn't what your daughter wanted. I don't even believe it's what his kids wanted. It's what ***he*** wanted.)

Please tell your husband for me that he does not love God. God is just an excuse he uses to justify some really horrible, manipulative, controlling, dishonest and disrespectful behavior. Seriously, please tell him for me. Show him my post.

His conduct was absolutely disgusting. Made even more so by the fact that he's trying to make it look like ***you're*** the one who has the issue. Like ***you're*** the one who's being controlling and disrespectful. I rarely see, in this subreddit, such clear instance of projection, especially of this magnitude.

Why believe a single thing he says now? He's proven that he is manipulative and will lie right to your face. I have no doubt that what your daughter says is true: that he really does try to use her a baby sitter every time she gets together with her step-siblings.

AITA for giving my dad his money back in front of his other kids and telling him he was no longer welcome at my graduation?,"My graduation ceremony is being held next week. My dad had given me some money in advance to pay for the party. I live mostly with my mom but they were supposed to be hosting the event together.

Dad and I have a rocky relationship. After my parents divorced when I was 4 they split custody of me and he was able to stay a good dad. When I was 10 he met Jane. Jane had three kids, twins and a single kid. They got married when I was 12 but I would say even before that I felt like he prioritized her kids over me a lot. He would cancel plans with me if they wanted to do something and would either do the thing with them or force me to go and say it was even better than our plans, when for me it wasn't. Think going for a hike with me vs taking them to an indoor play area. Or seeing a movie with me vs the kiddie park. One more example is when I was given a ticket for a concert my dad and I both love. He was supposed to buy a ticket to come with me for some father/son time, but actually spent it on his youngest stepkid who wanted their room painted. He told me at the last minute and it hurt. There are other times stuff like this happened. He didn't show up at the hospital when I broke my arm because one stepkid was getting their tonsils out and wanted both him and his wife there. He told my mom over the phone to tell me he was proud of me for being brave and understanding, even though I never said that shit.

When I would bring this stuff up to him he'd tell me it was natural to feel jealous of sharing his attention. That was all he would say.

In 2019 he told my mom he would split the cost of a trip I wanted to go on with one of my clubs, because she didn't have the money all by herself. Mom had her half saved. We told my dad he needed to pay. He said bills were tight and it was the twins birthdays and the money needed to go on something for them. He told me we could do something as a family when the trip happened instead. I told him to forget it. That he was making it clear who was more important and I was going to stay with my mom where I actually mattered. Mom borrowed money to cover the other half of the trip.

Dad told me he regretted making me feel less important and we were working on things and then the graduation money was given about a month ago. Then a week ago he called and told me how one of the stepkids was being bullied, how bad of a time they're having it, and with that money they could help cheer them up for their birthday. I was pissed. I hung up. Then two days later I showed up at his doorstep, gave him the money and told him I didn't want to see him or his new family at my graduation, and that he had chosen who was more important so he better stay out of my life. His stepkids and two younger bio kids were there.  I didn't stick around. He called and told me we needed to talk it out like adults, and that I had hurt the kids feelings. His wife freaked out on me so I blocked her.

AITA?",33357,v4350c,"NTA, but I hope you go NC with him now. He's either gonna apologize with half nothings and say how sorry he is , and then do what he's always done, or he's gonna try and guilt you into apologizing for something that was never your fault in the first place.

Best of luck OP, and have a fun graduation. It sure will be better without your shame of a father in it. He's only going to talk about his step kids there anyways.",2978,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v4350c/aita_for_giving_my_dad_his_money_back_in_front_of/
AITA for taking my daughter and leaving the wedding after her stepbrother pulled her wig?,"


My daughter (16) Megan just finished her cancer treatment, she's lost her hair in the process and she's been incredibly insecure because of it. She no longer meets friends nor welcomes them at our home nor even meet family on person. It's been bad to say the least but her stepbrother (18) Ben has been making it worse with his nagging comments and jokes about her looks. He tried taking and posting pics of her secretly to share but I shut that down even though my husband thought it was just ""harmless teasing"".


My husband's sister's wedding was last week. The family wanted Megan yo go but she didn't want to. I spent so much time trying to help her and convince her to start socializing again and see family. She agreed under the condition that I let her wear a wig which I agreed, not only that but I took her shopping to pick her own wig and she looked beautifully stunning in her pixie hairstyle wig. My husband and Ben laughed when they saw it. I don't know why.



We went to the wedding and everything was going well til this happened. We were all sitting and we started talking about Meghan look, suddenly Ben reached out and pulled her wig and exposed her head. I was shocked I froze but Megan yelled then took her wig and ran. Ben, his cousins and some guests started laughing. I was upset especially when looked over my shoulder and saw my husband sitting next to his mom and laughing. I lost it on Ben and berated him infront of everyone then took my stuff, got Megan and got into the car and went home. Ben and my husband didn't have a ride home and my husband kept calling me but I didn't respond. He came home asking about me leaving mid wedding and upsetting his sister and then leaving him and Ben with no rude home. I argued with him about how Ben embarrassed Megan and humiliated her publicly which must've ruined what's left of her self esteem. He said that it was just ""kids teasing each other"" and that I overreacted and Ben had no malicious intent he was just messing with her. I said I was sick of it but he said that this is their way of bonding as stepsiblings and I was getting inthe way of it and being overprotective and unreasonable. We didn't talk after that and Ben is refusing to apologize and his dad is backing him up.",33170,w631jl,YWBTA if you stay married to this man.  I would be kicking him and his AH son to the curb.

AITA for revealing to my dad’s wife the real reason why me and him were never close?,"My dad practically gave me up to his sister from the moment I (27M) was born. My mom died when she was giving birth to me. And my aunt told me he never recovered from that because he blamed me for her dying. 

It hurt a lot as a kid that at family events he would ignore my existence. When I was a little older he got more vocal about me “killing” her and he can’t stand to look at my face. 

You can imagine the amount of therapy that put me in. I used to go to church crying because I was scared about going to hell for doing that to my mom. That’s how much his words fucked me up. But the shitty part was that I never stopped trying to be accepted by him. After my highschool graduation he told me to never bother him again since he legally has no obligation to me anymore (since he was sending my aunt money to take care of me). Around that time is when I finally started accepting that reality so from there we moved on with our lives. 

My aunt doesn’t talk to me about him. Sometimes my grandparents do and that’s how I found out he got married. They were mad he didn’t invite me to their wedding but to me it didn’t matter because we’re not close. But it was his wife who wanted to meet me. It’s the first time ever that he wants to make contact and it was to pretty much say she wants me on their life. She doesn’t know the real reason about why we’re estranged, he asked me to please not say anything and maybe this could be a way to reconcile after all. 

But he was only doing it for her. That much was clear when we talked. I never said I would be he still insisted on us meeting at their place because she really wanted to meet me. All she thinks is we were estranged for not getting along in my teenager years, going to college and losing touch because of “life stuff.” It pissed me off that he played it off as us just not talking for petty reasons meanwhile the actually reason damaged me for years. 

I told her the truth. Everything he said to me. That he was never a parent to me, that was all my aunt. It was definitely a shock for her. The outcome was a disaster. Everyone has heard about this now. My grandma’s in particular told me she understands my anger. But this was his chance finding someone since losing my mom and now it’s been put in jeopardy. 

My dad is devastated. They think it was going too far to ruin his marriage that way when he was willing to include me in their lives which could have been the start of our relationship. And they say not only did I ruin that but also possibly wrecked his marriage. She just doesn’t agree at all with what he did and it could’ve been avoided if I didn’t say anything. 

For me it was hard not to tell the truth after the lies made it seem like it was nothing serious. I couldn’t ignore what happened after what it did. Idk if it was the right call since it put their whole marriage at risk after all.",33018,tuydop,"NTA. Saying you lost touch due to tumultuous times as a teenager and distance in college is making the fault of your estrangement mutual. It was not mutual. He lashed out with horrifying, inaccurate and traumatizing language throughout your childhood and abandoned you immediately after birth. He is absolutely deserving of every complication his torment of you brings him. If he could not raise you or treat you with respect, he should have never associated with you. 

His wife was owed the truth because your trauma and abandonment were perpetuated up to and through their wedding. He was not just someone who couldn't raise their child due to his own trauma, he created trauma. He could have found love long ago if he wasn't so hard hearted.",3417,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tuydop/aita_for_revealing_to_my_dads_wife_the_real/
AITA for not letting my girlfriend wear her “unique” dress to a wedding?,"UPDATED! 

Throwaway account because she uses reddit. 
My (M25) girlfriend (F30) Nat has a very particular sense of style. Picture Harley Finkle from wizards of waverly place, you will get the idea. 
Don’t get me wrong, i never had a problem with that! In fact, i love the way she dresses because she loves to do so, and i am happy if she is happy. The thing is, sometimes she likes to incorporate memes into her clothes. No problem. It’s cute. But now she wants to wear a dress inspired on the meme “gay rat wedding”. To my friend’s wedding. He and his fiancé are gay. I told her, maybe that is not really appropriated? The dress in question would be full of little stuffed rats, pride flags and a big “I SUPPORT GAY RATS” on the front. 
My friend is not a big fan of the way my GF dresses and i think this dress may cause an certain uproar in the wedding. Now, nat is upset with me and claiming that i am “throwing water in her flame of creativity”. 
The wedding is next month, so she has plenty of time to think about another thing to wear. Should i just let her go with the dress? Am i the asshole in this situation?





UPDATE:

well guys, as many of you pointed out in the comments, me getting a throwaway account didn’t help. She found the post. Guess i was too specific after all. I will update soon




FINAL UPDATE:

Hello everyone! I would like to thank you all for your judgment, advices and opinions on my post, it was greatly appreciated! So… the conversation did not go well. She was livid with me for exposing her in this way, and although i showed her the comments (most important, the ones from the LGBTQIA community) she refused to admit that her dress was a poor choice, but in fact, her way to “appreciate the gays”. That did not sit well with me. Love can move mountains, but can NOT maintain a relationship with a homophobic. So, now i am going to the wedding a single, rat-free-dress, man! I did reach out to my friend and send him this post. He thought the situation to be hilarious, but if she did show up in the dress, he would def kick us to the curb. I guess this is all! 
Ps: i am deeply sorry for misspelling harpey’s name, won’t happen again lol",32942,ser504,NTA. This is a bad idea. The wedding is not her chance to make a creative splash.

AITA for telling my soon-to-be niece that she doesn't need to wear a dress to my wedding?,"I (32f) am getting married to my fianc´é (41m) next year. After we got engaged, I suggested it might be nice if I asked my fiancé's niece (who's 15) if she wanted to be a bridesmaid too. I've only met her a couple of times, so we're not close, but she seemed like a cool kid and I thought it might be a nice way for us to bond/ get to know each other/ involve her in the wedding. (Side note - she's the only niece/ nephew on either side of the family).

Anyway, cut to a few weeks ago and we're in my fiancé's hometown to visit his family and discuss wedding-related stuff. His brother, sister-in-law and their daughter came over and I noticed this time that she was dressed a lot more androgynous than I remembered. The topic moved to wedding dresses and bridesmaid's dresses and I could see she was immediately uncomfortable. Her parents (her mum really) and grandma were making comments about how she'd need to be more feminine/ brush her hair etc, and how nice it would be to see her like that. I'll be honest and say this hit a nerve with me, as I was very much a tomboy as a teenager (even though I'm not anymore) and it absolutely broke me whenever my relatives would say things like that. Eventually, her mother made a comment along the lines of, ""It'll be nice to see you dressed like a girl for once."" and she looked really sad/ embarrassed/ upset.

In response, because that *really* hit a nerve, I immediately told her that my maid of honour would be wearing a trouser suit for the wedding and not a dress and that I'd given all the bridesmaids the option of wearing anything they want as long as it's in the ""wedding colour"", to make things easier. I pulled out my phone and started showing her photos of the ideas my friend had sent me (a jumpsuit, culottes, a trouser suit, a tailored tux etc) and let her know that she could pick anything at all she wanted - she could even wear jeans and trainers if that made her comfortable – and that it's a wedding, not a fashion show.

My niece perked up a bit when I said that but her mum looked really pissed off. She's since asked my fiancé to pressure me into getting all the bridesmaids dresses so their daughter will have to wear one (which, lol, no). My husband doesn't give a shit what she wears, but obviously also doesn't want his family and me to be arguing on the wedding day. I don't want to back down because I know what it feels like to be pressured into wearing something that makes you uncomfortable, but on the other hand, I know it's only for a day and it'd make the family happy. 

AITA for trying to overrule her parents?",32689,uhde21,"NTA

She's 15 and is old enough to decide on how she would like to dress. 

You are being very reasonable by allowing her to be comfortable in what she is wearing, as long as it is meeting the wedding colour. 

The mum is an asshole for trying to make her daughter wear something that she would be uncomfortable. This would make her not enjoy being your bridesmaid and could also affect your happiness knowing that one of your bridesmaids are not happy.",6366,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uhde21/aita_for_telling_my_soontobe_niece_that_she/
"AITA for the email I sent to a teacher about her ""You have to include everyone"" rules, saying that was a dangerous lesson?","My daughter is 12, I'm trying to teach her ways of creating and respecting her boundaries that are age appropriate. Teaching her that it's ok to say ""No"" to things she feels uncomfortable with.

There is a boy in her class who keeps bothering her and her female friends at recess. I've encouraged her to go to me or her teacher when this happens.

My daughter told me a few days ago that in class, the teacher had asked the kids to form groups of about four or five. She had formed a group of five with some other girls, then the boy who had been giving her trouble at recess came over and said he was joining their group. Another girl said that they already have five, and he should work with a group who only have two or three people. 

He said no because the teacher had said ""about"" four or five. My daughter then said that they didn't want to work with him, and he should find another group. A few of the other girls agreed with her. He said that ""you can't exclude me like that, it's against class rules"" and she said she didn't care. 

I heard about this from my daughter first, and the way she talked about it, she had been firm but not unkind.

But then I got an email from her teacher saying she wanted to call. She said there had been an incident at school where my daughter had excluded another child, and that wasn't allowed in her class, and she wanted me to have a talk with her about it. Her telling of events was the same as my daughter's. I felt proud of my daughter for her honesty. 

I sent her an email saying..

Dear Mrs. (Teacher)

I'm sorry, but that is not a lesson I feel comfortable teaching my daughter. 

She's at the age where she is already having to deal with unwanted attention, and I'm making a point to teach her that she does not have to be around anyone who makes her uncomfortable. And that a young lady is able to choose to spend time with people who make her feel respected.

I understand you already are aware (Boy) has been behaving in ways that she feels uncomfortable with at recess, from our prior conversations.

I think it is a very dangerous lesson to teach a girl she has to include and be kind to everyone, instead of teaching her to be aware of when someone is not respecting her ""No"" and stepping out of the situation.

I hope I don't have to explain in too much detail why I find this important... But to put it briefly, I was brought up with the ""Include everyone"" mindset. No exceptions. It taught me to ignore my own comfort level, and as I became a young adult I became the victim of men who used my inability to say ""No"" to their advantage. It's a dangerous lesson, and no longer appropriate at that age. 

Thank you,

OP

She emailed me back asking for a meeting in person with the principal. I'm preparing for that but wondering if my email was too harsh

AITA for my response to my daughter's teacher?

////

Edit to update...

I reached out to the parents of the other four girls in the class who were involved, and we all coordinated to go speak to the school administration together. They had similar views, thinking it was inappropriate for the school to expect the girls work with someone who they're not comfortable with, and frustrated the teacher didn't do more to deal with the issues during recess that made the girls uncomfortable to start with. 

I ended up asking the school if we could reschedule the meeting to a time all the involved families could make, and we ended up meeting this afternoon along with my husband, another couple, two mothers, and a father. Along with the teacher and principal. 

We all presented a united front asking for the following...

The school does training for the teachers on trauma-informed teaching methods and the dangers of expecting young women to go against their best judgement of their own boundaries to be ""nice"". Instead of ""Include everyone"" the kids should be allowed to respectfully set boundaries and taught to respect each other's boundaries.

The school addresses harassment in class or at recess and doesn't enable it to continue. 

We went to talk, and I think it went a lot better having all the parents join instead of if I'd gone alone. The teacher and principal apologized and the principal agreed to look for resources on how to better navigate the balance between being inclusive and not forcing kids into including someone who is crossing a line with them.

Thanks a lot for all the amazing advice in the comments, I cannot believe how much this blew up and I'm so grateful to everyone who replied with advice and support. And honestly was getting pretty emotional hearing how the lessons I'm trying to teach my little one resonated with other women, whether they're moms too, or have been through some of the same struggles I have.",32661,uaxvzp,"NTA, and you should ask them why are they more concerned about your daughter saying no than being concerned that the boy is constantly harassing your daughter and friends.",3308,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uaxvzp/aita_for_the_email_i_sent_to_a_teacher_about_her/
AITA for getting my aunt and uncle kicked out of their house for not letting my husband and I sleep together?,"I (M27) am married to a man (M28). He is the love of my life. I had only ever dated women before him but when I met him I realized I was bi, and we fell in love. We got married in the fall of 2018, so it’s been almost 4 years. We now live in Vermont.

My whole family is from a small town in Texas, a super conservative Catholic area. I was raised there, but dad got a job in NYC when I was 15. The culture shock was difficult. We went from living in rural Texas to living in an apartment in Manhattan.

My parents didn’t sell our house in TX, they allowed our aunt & uncle who just had their 3rd child to move in while charging them a small rent. 
In college when I came out as bi, my brother and dad were very supportive. My mom needed some time to accept. The rest of my family reacted poorly at first but came around. 

During visits we stayed with my aunt and uncle at my old house, but because we weren’t married we weren’t allowed to share a bed. We didn’t argue, we both would rather make peace. Visiting since, instead of staying with my aunt & uncle we would rent a motel room.

During Covid we did not visit them. But this summer, my parents and bro decided to go visit my hometown again for 2 weeks, & invited my husband and I. I wanted a motel again but my aunt & uncle insisted my brother, husband and I stay with them.

The 1st night sleeping situation was being discussed after my cousins went to bed. My aunt & uncle wanted me and bro to take the spare bedroom, husband on couch. All 3 of us took issue with that. 

They snapped that we were not really married because we were gay, & that they had children in the house. They said that it would be a bad influence on their kids. This hurt my husband’s feelings and he started crying & ran out of the room. When my husband ran out, my uncle had the audacity to start laughing. That’s when I saw red. 

I started cussing them out so loudly that my young cousins came to investigate. I told them that if they didn’t go apologize to my husband immediately then I was going to tell my dad what just happened, and I was going to make sure to have them kicked out of the house — that was still in my parents’ name.

My bro seconded everything that I was saying. They started backtracking and saying that we were still welcome in “their” house but that we had to follow their rules, I responded that it wasn’t really THEIR house. I told them they were going to be homeless if I had my way.

The kids started crying cause they heard me say they were all going to be homeless, so we left. My husband was on the porch crying, I promised him that I would never subject him to that again.

I told dad what happened. To say that my dad was angry would be an understatement. He served them a notice of eviction for 60 days. I have been getting calls and texts and Facebook messages from my family calling me AH.

I want to know AITA for allowing my young cousins to end up homeless? Is it fair that they have to pay for what my aunt and uncle said to me and my husband?",32609,x74x76,"NTA

They insisted a hotel was not needed and then decided to disregard your marriage. The whole 'not married so separate rooms' thing was clearly an excuse before aswell.

AITA for serving my husband's family Mac N Cheese for dinner?,"My husband (Asian) and I (american) welcomed our first born 4 weeks ago. The baby is health (Thank God) but I'm exhausted, haven't fixed my hair, barely able to shower and can not sleep.


My husband's family had been pressuring us to visit to meet the baby. I tried to hold them off as much as I could but yesterday, I was surprised to find them standing on the porch. turns out hubby invited them for dinner. I was embarrassed and felt like I wasn't ready for visitors (judgemental ones at that 😉) cause the house was a M.E.S.S y'all. Anyways, my husband sat with them while I fed my son then later I asked my husband if we should order take out for dinner. He said ""NO"" because his parents would find this rude and unwelcoming. He suggested that I go inside the kitchen and prepare something, anything long as it's ""homemade"". I said fine then went and made some Mac N cheese. The reason I prepared this meal is because of how easy it is.

Once I served the family, My husband's mom looked at me and was appalled. I noticed something was wrong. She asked if I really found it ""appropriate"" to serve her and the family Mac N cheese. I asked why not and she went on a rant about how disrespectful this was and that I clearly have no experience in what is right and wrong when it comes to hosting. I said excuse me? Who said I signed up to host an expected visit from them and she took it as in I didn't want them there. her husband said they were just there to finally see the baby that I kept them from seeing for an entire month. that's a whole month of his life they ""missed"" out on. We had an argument and they decided to go home. My husband said that deciding to serve his family Mac N cheese was more offensive then serving them nothing at all. I told him I was too exhausted to cook their ""traditional feasts"" that I was forced to learn from his mom. He took offense and said that I was being mean and disrespectful towards not only his family but his culture. I went inside the bedroom to stay with my son. My husband stayed on the phone with his family for an hour then kept giving me the cold shoulder and refused to eat what I cook in support of his family.

I understand how some guests might find it offensive especially his family. but I was just trying to make a quick homemade meal like my husband wanted. What's wrong with Mac N cheese?


EDIT* Ok, So I'm seeing commenters here offering to come over for some Mac N cheese. It's amazing to hear that some people here would aporeciate this kind of meal. It kinda makes me feel relieved and reassures me that I didn't mess this up entirely.

AITA for not wanting coal for Christmas?,"This year I went to my fiancé’s house for Christmas. It was my first time going, as we would typically go to my family’s house instead. 

I got a (rather pricey) gift for my fiancé “Dan” related to his hobbies, I got nice gifts for “Dan’s” parents based off of things I’d talked about with them before, and I got a small pack of chocolates for each of Dan’s other relatives (I didn’t know them that well). 

I wasn’t expecting many gifts from Dan’s relative’s because I didn’t know many of them that well, but I was certainly expecting more than I got. 

At first, I was excited when I saw that there was a big pile of gifts for me. However, once I opened the first one it was just a piece of coal. Everyone laughed, and I just kind of laughed along thinking it was a gag gift and that the other gifts would be different. But every single one turned out to be coal. All 18 of them. 

I started to get upset, so I cried and lashed out at Dan. But he calmly explained apparently this is a longstanding tradition in his family where they gift coal to newcomers who are celebrating Christmas with them for the first time. He explained that it’s just easier that way since all the relatives who might not know the newcomer well don’t have to stress over finding a gift, and it’s a fun experience for the newcomer as well. 

I told Dan I couldn’t believe I skipped my own family’s celebration for this and left.

throwaway. this whole situation is so bizarre that I still can't really process it. it still doesn’t feel real but I feel scared and guilty

I (19F) had surgery a couple days ago to get all 4 of my wisdom teeth out and because I have a really bad fear of dentists, they had to drug me pretty hard to do the removal. Not like laughing gas that wears off really fast, but actual IV medicine so I was pretty much unconscious during the whole thing. They told me to have a ""responsible adult"" drive me to the appointment and back because the meds they gave me would make it dangerous to drive. My mom was on a work trip and couldn’t take me, so I asked my sister in law Bri (24, not her real name) if she could do it as the whole thing would only take an hour or two. I even offered gas money because the dental office is about 45 minutes away. I would have asked my brother but he works during the day while bri is a stay at home mom to their 2yo daughter who I think was at bri's mom's house that day.

Bri agreed to take me to my appointment and the surgery went fine, bri waited in the lobby for me to be done. When I came out of anesthesia I was very disoriented and nauseous, which I guess is normal. I had gauze shoved in my mouth to stop any bleeding and bri took me to her car after I was let go.

I don’t really remember much of the drive but it felt like not enough time passed before bri got out of the car and told me to come with her. I was really out of it and just followed her because the alternative was staying in the hot car.

long story short, we were at a pool?? I was really confused but once we were through the gate bri basically parked me at one of those little table-benches said she'd be back in a while. I was still trying not to puke and was really dizzy from the heat (90+ degrees) and the drugs, so I asked her to take me home but she wouldn't. I guess since it was her day off and she didn’t have my niece she was meeting friends at the pool. I was starting to feel really sick and on the verge of passing out or having a panic attack, so I called my brother. I don’t think he could understand me between the meds and the stuff in my mouth because he hung up and I guess called bri because she came stomping back over, cussing and yelling at me, and took me back to the car. I passed out on the drive home, but when we arrived my brother had left work and met us in the driveway. He was screaming at bri and she was crying. I was still pretty disoriented but my brother took me back home and stayed with me until the meds wore off. That's when he told me he's divorcing bri because of what she did plus some other things he didn’t go into detail about.

It's been a few days since then and bri has been blowing up my phone telling me what a bitch I am and how me tattling destroyed her family. Part of me feels bad because of my niece and I wonder if I should've jjst dealt with it and waited for her to be done at the pool instead of calling my bro and causing problems.

AITA for sending my coworker into anaphylactic shock?,"I'm at a loss here guys. Realistically, I know I'm in the clear. Legally, I'm in the clear. But I'm being vilified by my coworkers, and I'm genuinely considering quitting my job because of this mess.


So I work a pretty standard day job, and at night I help my friend at her restaurant, which serves an assortment of Thai cuisine. Tbh I'm insanely picky, but I fell in love with this peanut sauce the main chef makes, and he showed me how to make it, so about once a week I take it on either noodles or stir fry to my day job for lunch. People know this and a handful have tried it. It smells nutty, it tastes nutty. It's white girl pad Thai, basically.


Lately my lunches have been disappearing, or I'll open my lunchbox to find half of my food missing. I've tried addressing it, but nothing has been changing, and I was pretty sure it was one of the new hires that was doing it, but had no proof. Until now.



Thursday I took my noodles, and my entire tupperware was missing, which hasn't happened before. I'm pissed, but what can I do? A coworker shared her pizza with me and that was that, until today. My boss confronted me and accused me of poisoning my noodles because his daughter (one of the new girls) ""borrowed"" my lunch and had to be hospitalized. Turns out she's severely allergic to nuts, ate some and boom. Anaphylaxis.  She used an epi pen, had to be hospitalized and now her dad is trying to hold me accountable for her bills and condition, but I don't see it. Why should I pay? I don't mark my food as an allergen because I'm not allergic to it, she was just dumb enough to steal from me and eat something she can't have. 


But he's being hateful, and some of my older coworkers are icing me out because I warned him I'd report any harassment to HR if he tried anything funny. Brown nosers, I guess. My friend is aware and offered me a full time job, but I just can't help but feel it's unfair. At the same time, I could have killed his daughter tho... So, AITA?




Edit: holy shitballs this blew up!



I *did* email the HR rep and let her know of the situation. She's been on vacation and gets back tomorrow, so I don't know if she's aware of what's been going on since last week. I should note that I work weekends most weeks, not quite a 8-5 M-F job, but yeah. 



My coworkers mostly chilled out by the end of my shift, thankfully, after I explained to the (nosiest) friendlier person that I always bring a peanut sauce dish. I guess the general assumption was that I somehow found out who has been stealing lunches and decided to poison them?



To answer a common question: this was the first time my pad thai was stolen, and no I'm not the only victim of the lunch thief. I usually take a late lunch, and I'm not the only one, so I'm guessing the lady who was stealing food decided what was left is a free for all. F her. My boss said it was an HR issue when I'd tried talking to him about lunches disappearing, and HR always said they'd look into it (or further into it) and nothing ever happened. We're 100% not allowed to eat at our desks, unless you have a medical reason for it, so that wasn't an option either.



I'm assuming she's fine, but I don't know the severity of her allergy or how much she ate before she had her reaction. I'm not privy to her medical information, sorry guys.



Suing.... Sounds like a great revenge, but probably not worth the cost of a lawyer. My friend let me take tonight off to just bitch about everything, and I'm probably going to take her job offer. One commenter was right; even if everything settles down, I don't want to deal with a potentially hostile or reactive workplace like this anymore. It's not a  career with much room for upward mobility, and I didn't feel welcome in our group meeting today.


And for the people calling this fake, okay? It's not, but even if it were, why are you getting mad about it? Karma doesn't give me anything, monetarily or status. I can't exactly give out a bunch of details unless I want to dox myself, and the post seems rushed because I wrote it out of frustration during my lunch. Short time+word limit= rushed. Sorry it didn't meet your writing standards.



Anyway, I'll keep reading comments and responding occasionally, but this is it for me unless I get something worth updating. Thanks for everyone's opinions! (And the information about Caesar dressing and Worcestershire [thanks Google] having anchovies. That's crazy!)





Edit: the recipe




2 tbsp red curry paste 
3/4 cup smooth natural peanut butter
1/4 cup sugar
2 tsp dark soy sauce
2 tbsp cider vinegar
3/4 cup of water
12 oz of coconut milk


I cook it on med-low heat and add more water if it seems too thick. And use regular coconut milk!! The low fat isn't as good imo



I had to find one for home that seemed similar to the restaurant's since I'm not making enough for an army! I like this one, but I'm also lazy and want it done in 15 minutes. I hope everyone likes it! If not... Well, you tried something new

No, she could have killed herself.  My wife had a heavy duty seafood allergy.  She wouldn't eat anything without knowing what was in it.   Like, Cesar Salad dressing has anchovies in it.  Other sauces are made with seafood to.  It can had in places you wouldn't expect.  So, she would never take someone else food (on principle first, because it's stealing) because it could be life threatening.

I would have thought that anyone with a severe food allergy would take the same precautions, but obviously not.

AITA for returning home after I found out that my husband booked 1st class for him and his friend while I got economy?,"

My husband and I 30s haven't been on a trip (out of coutry) for years. while he goes every year with his best friend. his reasons for going with him is because they both go to attend sporting events.


This year, my husband told me I could go with him and his friend since they were visiting a new destination. He paid for my ticket and everything else since I'm a sahm and have no job. the kids were left with my mom.


However. When I found out that he had booked 1st class for himself and his friend while I got economy. I just couldn't hold my tongue. I confronted him about it and he at first refused to discuss then when the argument got heated he yelled ""I PAID FOR YOUR TICKET FFS!!! ISN'T THAT ENOUGH???"" then kept on about how I should stop acting like I was ""royalty"" and that if I come to think about it, even economy is fine for me since I ""technically"" don't work anyway. I cried because of what he said but decided to just not go altogether. He changed his tone and started begging me to just go with what he planned but I declined. I went to pick the kids from my mom's house and he came back 3 hrs later huffing and buffing about what happened. His friend sent me a text calling me entitled, and said this was the reason why he didn't want my husband to take me with them and I just proved his point. I did not respond but I blocked him since he's gotten increasingly rude over the past few months.

Your husband's attitude is out of line. I absolutely hate it when sole providers act like this, treating their partners like lesser beings who should be grateful for every penny spent on them. As a sole provider myself, it enrages me. It costs me absolutely nothing to treat my partner like an equal. Additionally, you could always run the numbers by him (how much full-time nannies and housekeepers make), and remind him as a SAHM you damn well have a job and provide a service he should be grateful for.

The argument isn't about you having to ride economy, it's the principle and what it implies. You are not worthy of first-class and you should be grateful he thought of you to begin with. What a joke. You were right to be offended and take a stand against this behavior.

AITA for blowing up at my husband for messing with my alarm and causing me to miss my exam?,"

Hello! 

I f23 have been married to my husband m26 for a year. I'm in my last year of university and been so so busy for the last two weeks, with many projects and finals looming. My husband complains from seeing me studying and not doing activities together or hanging out with friends anymore. I've told him it's not gonna last forever and that I need to focus because this is my last year and it's been the hardest.



The day before the exam he wanted me to go with him to a friend's birthday party. I refused because I was busy preparing for my exam. he pleaded with me saying it's just one hour and talked about how his friends will be upset if I'm not there. I said no and shut down any further discussions. He got upset and called me selfish and inconsiderate but then dropped it.


Before I went to bed, I set my alarm clock like I always do since I'm a heavy sleeper+I stayed up late studying. The next morning I woke up at 9am. I literally freaked out and checked my alarm and found that it was set to go off at 9:30 am. I had no idea how this happened til my husband told me he did this to repay me for refusing to take one, one hour to attend the party so he took this hour from my time. I couldn't believe it I absolutely blew up at him just yelling and screaming at him left and right. He just stood there shocked from my reaction and my rage. I got dressed quickly and rushed to the university. 

They didn't let me into the exam hall. I got into a lot of hassle to get them to re-schedule the exam especially since I had no legit reason as to why I was late. It was awful is all I can say.


I went home and my husband and I stopped speaking to each other. He kept acting as if I hurt his feelings and traumatized him by yelling. And that I deserve what he did since he was frustrated with my continual refusal to attend all events for the past 2 weeks. I might be wrong for not considering it but I think that my exams should be a priority and his way of ""teaching me a lesson"" was not right.",32207,vu7te5,That's a divorce level sabotage of your degree.,1262,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vu7te5/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_husband_for_messing/
AITA for walking out of the babyshower my InLaws threw for me?,"The situation is kind of a mess.

I (f27) am expecting my first baby with my husband. This is the first grandchild in the family (InLaws) and they said that if the baby's a boy then we'll give him my father InLaw's name (he's dead due to cancer). I had no problem with that.

This happened before we found out the gender of the baby - my husband and his family had me ""do things"" like attend prayers and do other rituals before the reveal at the drs. I didn't like that but went with it to keep the peace.

Dr appoitment came, and it turned out to be a girl. My husband cried in the car then turned his phone off to hide from his family then finally told them. His mom and the others made their frustration & disapppintment clear which bothered me cause my daughter deserves to be celebrated but, they ghosted me for days then started coming over & visiting constantly referring to my daughter as my son claiming the results were false and basically pretending it's a boy. I had severa fights with them after they refused to stop it, and my husband sided with them despite seeing how wrong and unreasonable what they were doing was. We didn't speak for a while

Sister InLaw called to apologize then inform me she arranged for a babyshower for me. I was so excited and happy. But when I arrived I saw blue balloons, blue cake with Father InLaw's name/decorations around. I was so confused I had to sit down. Sister InLaw explained they were ""still"" hoping the gender results are false and it's a boy. I looked at my husband and he agreed with her. I lost my temper and yelled at them all calling them delusionals and telling them to stop treating my daughter like she's unwanted and act like she doesn't exist by throwing a party for ""their imaginary grandson"". mother InLaw break down crying, I took my bag and walked out immediately.

They started yelling and my husband followed me outside and started arguing about how I insulted his family, and his dads memory by acting like that. I told him to wake up and see the insanity in his family's behavior. He said they needed time to process the fact that it's a girl not a boy as they expected and insisted I play along and ""they'll soon get over it"". I said absolutely not and demanded he take me home, he said no so I called an Uber and left. He was fuming he called 15 times, then texted that he won't be coming home til I ""get my ass"" over and apologize for ruining everything THEY'VE DONE FOR ME and accusing them of being mentally unstable. I haven't responded yet he's constantly pressuring me to get right with his family before we even talk about anything else.",31889,ts4qx0,NTA and they sound scary.

AITA for canceling the plans for thanksgiving after my parents called my brother’s baby their “first grandchild”?,"[update](https://www.reddit.com/user/throwawayz_12345/comments/yy9a7e/update_on_canceling_the_plans_for_thanksgiving/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

I (32f) have been with my wife Ava (34f) for 8 years now, but we’ve been married for 5. She was a single mom of three kids when we started dating, she had two daughters (now 10 & 12) and a son (now 16). I’ve watched these kids grow up, I’ve read the bedtime stories, done bath time, the first days of school, pta meetings, all of it. I very much consider them to be my kids, and they’ve been calling me mom for almost 6 years now.

My brother Ivan (28m) just had a baby girl with his fiancé Sara (27f). I love my niece, and my kids adore their cousin. My kids have been the only grandchildren on my side of the family since Ava and I got together, and there’s never been a moment where the kids and my wife were treated like they didn’t belong.
My brother is their uncle, my mom and dad are their nana and pop— the kids see my family as their family and I always thought that my family felt the same way about them.

The kids and I were over at my brother's house just hanging out, and my parents ended up dropping by with gifts for my niece.
Ivan laughed when he saw the toys and told our mom and dad that they were going to end up spoiling her rotten. My mom said since my niece is their first grandchild of course they have to spoil her.

My kids were sitting in the living room with all of us and my youngest daughter looked hurt when she realized what my mother said. My son and my 12yo didn’t fully react to it, but I could tell it bothered the both of them too.

Sara spoke up and said “oh you mean first grandbaby, not first grandchild.”

My dad shook his head and replied that my niece was their first grandchild. I didn’t want my kids to keep sitting there and listening to that so I handed my son my keys and told him to wait in the car with his sisters. When they were gone, I asked my parents why the hell they’d say that my kids weren’t their grandchildren, and my mom said they couldn’t be their grandchildren because they weren’t really my children.

My wife and I were going to be hosting thanksgiving at our house this year, but I told my parents that if they didn’t view my kids as their family, then they could just host a meal at their own house with their “real” family while I spent the holiday with mine.

I left before they could say anything else to me, and my wife and I have reiterated to the children that they will always be my kids and I will always be their other mom, regardless of our DNA.

My brother is pissed at me now because he thinks I reacted too harshly, and that I should try to see where my parents are coming from. My mom texted saying that she and my dad love the kids, but they still aren’t their grandchildren, and she hopes that we can come to understand that because she doesn’t want this to ruin my niece’s first thanksgiving.

I haven’t replied back. I meant what I said, but I’m worried that maybe I’m reacting too harshly.

ETA INFO:

I adopted all three of the kids about 4 years ago, so they aren't just my parents ""step grandchildren"". Even if I hadn't legally adopted them, they'd still be my kids in my eyes.

Edit no.2:

- My wife's parents don't have a relationship with the kids. When my wife came out, they pretty much stopped speaking with her entirely.
- Their bio dad is not involved and neither is his family. He lost his rights to the children before Ava and I started dating. The 10yo has never met him, the 12yo doesn't remember him, and the 16yo wants nothing to do with him.
- My parents wanted the kids to call them Nana and Pop. I didn't make the kids start calling them that.",31651,ysezdy,"Damn, Sara even gave them an out with the “oh you mean grand baby” comment, which is a slip of tongue I can see people saying unintentionally, but they doubled down twice!

AITA for making my SIL pay above average rent for one bedroom?,"I am 100% being petty here but curious if I am actually wrong. Most of my husbands family think I am being childish and ""need to let the past go"", as my SIL can't afford this but her behavior toward us in the past makes me feel this is warranted.

2 years ago my house burnt to the ground after being struck by lightening. Thankfully it was during the day so our 3 kids were at school and my husband and I were at work. We lost everything but we were safe. It took almost 11 months for the insurance to pay out. The insurance covered 1 month worth of hotel stays but after that we were made to fend for ourselves and the only option we had was to move in with my SIL. She tells us we can have her spare room and her office space, since she used neither of the rooms and her stipulations was we needed to purchase all of our own food and pay her $100 a week. By week 3 all of that changed. She then decides we need to pay her $250 a week and we can only use one room. So all 5 of us were crammed in to the smallest room she had, which was the size of a glorified closet space and didn't even fit a twin bed and a small dresser (so we lived out of trash bags and slept on the floor) for close to $1000 a month some months and still had to purchase all of our own food, despite her claiming my children on her foodstamps. She also had no bills outside of her land tax ($450 a year), electric and heating oil (which she hardly ever filled). So we were essentially paying her so she could do leisure activities. It was the worst 8 months of my life. 

3 months ago my grandmother decided that she wanted to go to assisted living after a fall and transferred the deed of her house to me and basically said it was mine now. It is a 5 bedroom farmhouse. My boys insist on sharing a room so we have 2 extra bedrooms. Well, my SIL lost her house last month due to not paying her land tax for several years and asked if her and her step daughter could stay with us until they get enough money to move down south. I said sure, 1 bedroom, $800 a month and you have to buy and cook all your food separately because my daughter is vegan. She looked at me like I had 10 heads and said that she and her step daughter should not be made to share a room when there are 2 extra rooms and stated she cannot afford a rent of $800 while purchasing all of her own food on top of it. I said ""neither could we but we managed to cram 5 people in to a glorified closet space while you were getting $1000 and foodstamps. Take it or leave it."" She decided to leave.

AITA for not treating my wife like an equal parent by telling her she has no say in the way I bond with my son and also calling her homophobic?,"  

When I (37M) was 17 got my then-girlfriend (16) pregnant with twin boys, her parents didn’t want the babies to “ruin” her future so they said that I had to either take them or give them up for adoption because she was not raising them. I wanted to give them up but my parents told me not to. 

For the first seven years of my boys’ lives, I didn’t act like a father and was more like a big brother (They knew I was their father though, but we never bonded like father-sons) 

When I was ready to move out, I wanted to do it without them but my dad let me know it was my responsibility so I had to take them (I didn’t want it at first but I’m glad it happened) We started bonding as father-sons, I started loving them and their love for me increased I remember the three of us would seat on the couch to watch movies, one would sit on my left and one on my right while I wrapped my arms around them, they’d put their heads on my chest and I often kissed their forehead. We’ve been doing this since they were seven.

I met my current wife, 5 years ago, (my kids were 15) we married 3 years ago after we welcomed our daughter (4F), she saw me doing this with my kids when we watched movies and she never said anything. 

My kids are no longer living with us because they left for college, but they come to see me every now and then. My boys are 20 now but they still like to put their heads on my chest while I wrap my arms around them, they do it every time they visit and I’m watching TV.

My son, Liam visited me 2 weeks ago, he came out to me as gay and introduced me to his bf. I don’t care how my kids live their sexuality or who they love, I love them no matter what, I just want them to be happy and I don’t feel any different, and it doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable to hug him or kiss his forehead, but it seems that my wife is a little uncomfortable. 

My son visited me again last Wednesday (Since he was here 2 weeks ago, so the first time “officially out”) I was watching “Red” with my daughter (she was on my left) then my son Liam arrived, he was tired and sat on my right, put his head on my shoulder while I wrap my arm around him, then I kissed his forehead and said, “Good to have you back buddy”. 

We went to sleep and the next day my wife told me that It made her feel uncomfortable (me hugging and kissing my son) and asked me not to do it again while she doesn’t mind me doing it with Lucas (my other son, straight) she doesn’t want me to do it with Liam. I told her that she has no business being in my relationship with my sons, I also called her homophobic. She accused me of not treating her like an equal parent, (to my sons) thus I said ""that's  ok because you are not"" 

My brother says I should understand because this is a big “change” for her (a son coming out) but seriously think there is nothing to get “used to” this isn’t neither her nor my problem who my son loves.

Confused, I clicked on the link and was shocked to discover that the profile belonged to my twin sister. The profile picture was very clearly a scantily clad image of her, and the username was my nickname that literally everyone in my life uses. I asked our friend about it and he told me that he had discovered the profile through twitter and then subscribed to the profile, which included dozens of videos of her doing… spicy things to say the least, solo and with partners, all of which with her face showing.

I was floored and, in a fit of rage, showed the profile to our parents. I mean… literally anyone who saw that profile that knows us would immediately assume that it’s me considering she’s basically going by my name.

AITA for pretending not to recognize my parents when they tried to reconnect?,"I was raised mostly by my uncle and aunt.  My older sister developed a serious illness when I was 6 and my parents decided that they couldn’t care for both of us I guess, so they kind of unceremoniously dumped me at my grandparents and my uncle took me in. Like, didn’t even explain to me what was going on, just “you’re going to go visit gran for awhile” and never picked me back up.  My grandparents and uncle explained it later, and they were pretty livid at my parents. I’ve seen my parents maybe 5 times since then and not at all for the last 9 years.  I decided to stop having contact with them when I was 12 and since I was the only one reaching out all communication broke down.  It turned out ok, I love my aunt and uncle and it turns out they can’t have kids so they’ve always said I’m their miracle kid, I was just misrouted by the stork at first. I was formally adopted by them when I turned 18, I wish it had been earlier but there were some red tape things that would have made that really expensive and difficult. I’m 21 now.

My sister passed away between thanksgiving and Christmas and I made a trip back from school for the funeral, but I stayed in the back and left before my bio parents could talk to me.  They called my uncle to try to talk to me, but I said I didn’t want to so he told them that I wasn’t available at the moment.

They finally caught up to me over Christmas when I went to midnight mass with my gran, and approached me and tried to give me a hug.  I did recognize them, but I pretended not to and just backed off and said “Sorry, do I know you?” They said “We’re your parents!” and I said “My parents are at home.” and went and sat down with my gran. They sat behind us and I could just feel the stare, and on the way out they were like “You really don’t recognize us?” And I said “Oh, are you my dad’s brother? I think I remember you from when I was little.”

My gran thinks they deserved it trying to come back to me like nothing happened, but they wrote me a long letter about how hurt they are and how I should understand that they were trying to do the right thing and how they’ll always be my parents and I can’t change that.

So I took a different approach. I stopped calling him ""angry"", or calling what he was doing ""arguing"" or ""yelling"". I just swapped in the words ""emotional"" or ""throwing a tantrum"" or ""having a fit""

I was kinda hoping if I could shift his reputation from domineering (big man vibes) to emotional and tantrumming (weak sad baby vibes) 

So I started just making subtle comments. Like if I had a meeting with him and he got a temper, I'd mention to the other people ""Wow, it's crazy how emotional Jay got. I dunno how he has the energy to throw a hissy fit at 9 am, I'm barely awake"" 

Or when my boss asked me to recap a meeting he missed, I told him ""Dan, Jack, and James had some really great feedback on my report for (this client). Jay kinda had trouble managing his emotions and had a temper tantrum again, but you know how he gets."" 

Or when a coworker asked why he was yelling I'd say ""Honestly I don't even know, he was getting so emotional about it he wasn't speaking rationally."" 

I tried to drop it in subtly and some of my coworkers started picking it up. I don't think consciously, just saying stuff like ""Oh, another of Jay's fits"" or something.

I got gutsy enough to even start saying to his face ""Hey, I can hardly understand what you're trying to explain when you're so emotional""

And again my coworkers started picking up on it and I even caught several of them telling him to get a hold of himself.

After a while, he started to get a reputation as emotional and irrational. Which I could tell pissed him off. But he stopped yelling at me as much. 

Anyway, he slipped once this week and I just said ""I really can't talk to you when you're being this emotional"" and he blew up at me asking why I was always calling him that. I shrugged and said ""dude you look like you're on the verge of tears, go look in the mirror before you ask me"" and he got really angry I suggested he might start crying. (That was a kinda flippant comment, he was red faced angry not tearful angry, and I could tell.) 

I feel like a bit of a dick for being petty and trying to gaslight this guy into thinking everyone around him sees him like a crybaby. But it also mostly worked when the ""proper channels"" didn't

AITA for favoring my scapegoat brother over his golden child twin sister?,"I (20m) has two younger siblings, ""Joe"" and ""Jill"". They're twins, both 18 and graduating high school this year. Jill is my parent's favorite, because they've always wanted a daughter, while Joe is their scapegoat, because I guess he's the bonus baby they never actually asked for. I'm mostly better off than Joe, as I'm the oldest grandson from both sides of my family, almost all of whom are just as blantant as my parents are about their favoritism.

I felt really bad for Joe, so I did what I could to make him feel less alone. Like when Jill got to go shopping with mommy and daddy, I took Joe skating with my friends. When our parents were too busy watching Jill's kiddie pageant, I dragged my best bud to sit through Joe's elementary school musical. Small things like that. It all started as pity moves, but soon my friends pretty much like Joe better than me, while Jill's princess syndrome got in her head, so now I spend more time with Joe because I simply like him better than Jill. Never said it out loud, but I don't make it a secret either that I prefer not to spend my time with entitled brats.

Anyway, like I said they're graduating soon. They both already had their choice of college, accomodations, etc. Jill's going to a uni in SF, fully funded by our parents, unsurprisingly. Joe's going to the same Uni as mine in Seattle, but different campus just 20ish minutes away. He got a full ride, which apparently makes him ineligible to get any financial help from his own parents. This is also hardly surprising, so I made some calls to ask around, see if anyone is hiring next fall. I did this while on facetime with Joe. I was reassuring him that we'll find him a job that don't suck and pays enough, that he's better off without dad's money anyway because we both know it comes with strings attached, that this way, mom and dad wouldn't be able to stick their noses into his purchases. I got him to feel better about the whole thing and logged off.

I guess Jill overheard, because the next day she sent me texts after texts demanding I help her find jobs as well because she doesn't want dad ""nagging her"". When I told her, politely btw, that I don't know anyone in SF, and that she'd get more help from mom and dad, she blew up, saying all these things about me favoring Joe over her, which, yeah. It's true. I love both of my siblings, but I don't particularly like Jill. It's not like she's making herself likeable, though, so AITA?",30992,tm2oh0,"NTA.

Your brother is very lucky to have you.

But remember that it is not your sister's fault, that her parents favoured her. It is also not her fault, that this made her entitled.

But she is an adult now, so it is her responsibility to do better in the future. She will need time for that. I would directly explain to her, why you treat them differently. Get it out in the open, it seems about time. Be kind and tell her, that you love her and don't blame her for your parents mistakes but also point out specific situations, where her behaviour made hanging out with her difficult.

It is also not your job to help your siblings. You are doing it for your brother, because you want to. You have good reasons to not want to do it for Jill as well. She did not even ask nicely, she just demanded it.

AITA for telling my inlaws about what their son's girlfriend did to my son's blanket and causing her to get shunned?,"

I F,33 found out that my ex husband M, 37 was cheating on me when I was 7 months pregnant with our son. I got a divorce and we share custody of our 3 yro old son. My ex husband's girlfriend tried to get involved in my parenting several times, she even commented on my son's name implying that we should agree on a name we all want not just what I wanted, and tried to dictate what he should and shouldn't have. As a result she started throwing stuff of his that I paid for myself. Honestly it's frustrating because I'm barely getting by with the money I have and can not afford to buy replacement for all the stuff she throws put but my ex husband says it's her ""house"" and she gets to decide what can and can't enter.


I made a crochet blanket for my son with his name on it. This blanket is special to me, and the tools I used to be able to make it cost me money. Not to mention the time and effort it took to get it down.


I sent my son to stay with his dad days ago, and he wanted to take the blanket with him to sleep with it. I don't know exactly what happened, but when I came to pick him up he told me his dad's girlfriend took it away from him and threw it out leaving him with no blanket to sleep with at night as ""punishment"" for him for not accepting the one she offered. I was furious. I called his dad but he hung up on me, I sent him a text explaining the situation, but he texted back telling me that I should stop the drama and go look for a job if I have so much free time on my hand instead of picking on his girlfriend. I felt frustrated I visited his family who are good to me and told them about what their son's girlfriend did, now it's worth mentioning that she's been working hard for their approval and to get on their good side. They were shocked to know about what she did they all flipped out on her and started calling her out. My SIL took it further by putting this on social media which made other family members see what she did.

My ex husband called me yelling about my ""pathetic attempt"" to turn his family against his girlfriend. I could hear her freaking out in the background while he was lashing out at me saying I ruined every chance she had to have a good relationship with her ""future inlaws"". I hung up and felt absolutely horrible, even though I was just venting to his family about what happened and felt frustrated. Maybe I shouldn't have told them? I'm not sure anymore since the whole family aren't speaking to her si that might have epa lasting impact on their relationship with her.",30887,w6u5j7,NTA this lady is abusing your child.

AITA for leaving a fake postive pregnancy test in the bedroom to catch my husband's mom snooping?,"My MIL moved in with us a month ago. I began to notice my stuff in the bedroom being touched. Furniture rearranged, stuff moved et cetera...


I felt like I was going crazy because my husband is the only one who has access to the bedroom and he doesn't usually touch nor come near my things. I figured it must be his mom walking in and snooping on my personal things. I told my husband and he said his mom would never...I had a huge hunch but couldn't instal a cam in the bedroom to catch her in act.


So, I got me one of those fake postive pregnancy tests and threw it in the bedroom's trashcan. note the trashcan was placed in the corner near the closet.



Literally the next day after I got to work, I got tons of calls and texts from my inlaws ""congratulating"" me for my ""pregnancy"". My husband came over to my workplace and was all worked up about it asking since when I was pregnant, and why I didn't tell him. I asked how he found out and he said his mom found the positive test in the trashcan in the bedroom. I asked if his answer just confirmed that she's been snooping in the bedroom all along. He had a ""realization"" moment but demanded we stick to the bigger issue, I said there was no bigger issue because the positive test was fake and this whole thing was done to expose my MIL's snooping. he was not convinced. he had me take an actual test right infront of him and he was livid asking how could I lie about such thing and break his mom's heart since I know...very well that she longs for kids. I got a lot of shit because of this from him, his mom and family now calling me a liar and manipulator.

AITA for staying true to my threats after my dad died?,"
My dad died unexpectedly last week and my sister Jess and I lost our mom last year to a mix of cancer and the virus. 
From how our family acted in the past over scavenging over dead people’s things both Jess and I decided to send out a family memo on no one is to enter or take anything from our parents house until we get there. Both Jess and I work on the west coast so it takes some time to get there with all of our kids and family. 

I saw several notifications from my parents Ring Doorbell and I’m a lawyer. I reminded my family we will prosecute. Jess and I are on the same page. 
Jess gets to my parents house first and notices stuff is missing and my parents had security cameras and an Alexa show. It shown my cousin taking stuff from the house. So Jess did what we agreed on and called the police and two of our cousins was arrested. Because it was over a thousand dollars both are looking at felonies. My cousin said my dad promised him this stuff and I have my dad’s will making me executor of the estate. I told him he should have waited to file a claim with estate and everyone was warned about what would happen. 
Jess and I don’t have the best relationship with our extended family and We are not dropping charges. Because of this drama dad was quietly cremated with no service and we plan to hold one when scattered our parents ashes at Jess’s house in a tree planted for them.

Your dad created a will and made you the executor of the estate for a reason. If your cousin's were actually meant to have the thousands of dollars worth of items they took, they could've waited until you arrived. 

It sucks that they got arrested but the first thing on their minds when losing a relative shouldn't be ""I should take items from their house"" or ""I'm owed these items let me go collect.""

AITA For not being happy that my sister is pregnant AGAIN?,"Throwaway because I don't want my family tracking this back to my main.

My sister got knocked up by her boyfriend right out of highschool, got married the next year, then proceeded to pop out another baby every year or two, so she has four now at 24. She's a stay at home mom even though she was brilliant and could have gotten a free ride to a great University. Since hers are the only grandkids, our parents fawn over her like she's the next coming of Christ. They gush over over every new tooth or haircut like it's some huge achievement.

Problem is, her husband's business wasn't great even even before COVID, and is barely limping along now. Sister doesn't work, and my parents have limited income. So guess who's constantly being told to ""lend"" them money for shit like school fees, car seat, car payment, new  stroller, etc. They don't even ask! My mom just texts me ""your sister needs $X.XX for the kids"" and I'm supposed to cough up. If I complain, they accuse me of being  jealous because I don't have a husband and family even though I'm older (I'm only 26!)

So over Easter I notice my sister isn't drinking and I think oh god, here we go again. Sure enough, she stands up and announces that she's been inseminated with yet another precious miracle.  Everyone's gushing and I just try to stay quiet and out of the way. 

Later she asks me if everything's alright and I try to play it off but she pushes so I asked her if she and her husband could really afford another baby. She very snippily replies ""God will provide like he has so far,"" which really pissed me off. I yelled that no, actually god didn't provide for her babies, **I** did, and I wasn't going to giving them any more handouts. It devolved into a big argument with everyone shouting at me, and basically I've been banned from my family unless I apologize. I haven't apologized. 

It's been radio silence except for one text from my mom saying that if my sister miscarries it's my fault for stressing her out. I asked if my sister was showing any symptoms but no one will answer or tell me. IDK. I don't think I'm TA but I don't want to be the reason she miscarries. Also, I think I might be TA because secretly I think it would be better if she did even though I wouldn't say that to her.",30739,u84njt,"NTA. They did you a favor by cutting you off.

"AITA? I went on vacation with my friend and her family, and they kicked me out. I got my own room and stayed.","I am in college and my roommate from last year, Meg, who's family is really rich, said she could bring a friend on vacation. It was kinda awkward, I was her third choice but her family vetoed the first two because they didn't want her bringing a boy or this other female friend of hers they disliked.

Her parents bought my plane ticket and booked the resort which I was very grateful for and I saved a lot of money up so I could make sure I buy my own food and activities when I'm there, and treat her family to a dinner as a thank you for the ticket.

But when the trip started, it was just bad. It was her, me, her mother, her father, two of her father's friends, and her three brothers going. 

On the flight, they all got first class and got me a economy seat. But I didn't say anything because why argue about a free ticket?

The first night they went to a grocery, it turns out they wanted to cook at the resort kitchen for the whole trip 

And by ""they wanted to cook"" it actually turned out that they wanted me and Meg to cook. I wasn't warned about this but it turns out Meg's family is sooo ""traditional"" that they see cooking as a women's job. And her mom had just had hand surgery.

So it was me and Meg cooking every meal for six men and her mom. And I can't cook well. I know a couple staple meals to feed myself but since I rarely eat meat I don't know how to cook it. I'm also ok at cooking for 1 or 2 but have no practice cooking for a group of 9

I screwed it up, undercooked chicken, and overcooked some steak and her dad was angry with me. I got short with him and told him that if he knew how to do better he could pitch in instead of standing around criticizing.

But he got furious and said he was on his vacation. I said that I was trying to have a vacation too, or did they invite me to be an unpaid domestic servant? 

Meg's parents and dad's friends got angry I said that and started yelling at me.

The argument escalated, I sarcastically called myself ""the help""

His dad snapped at me and told me to get out of their suite and go home. Didn't say shit about how he expected me to do that.

I left and called the airline with my ticket, and asked them if they could do anything to prevent anyone else from modifying or cancelling my ticket. They let me set a passcode, and no changes could be made to the flight without it.  

Then I went to the resort desk to ask about rooms, saying I was stranded unexpectedly. They actually did have some affordable rooms available because of a weekday discount. So I got housing and still had money left over for touristy stuff. 

I went sightseeing and relaxed on the beach for three days, until Meg's parents ran into me. They were taking a sunset walk and did a double take seeing me on the beach. They said they thought I was going home, and I said I decided to stay. They were angry because they saw me staying and using the return flight as having deceived them into thinking I couldn't afford a vacation, and using them for flights when I could actually afford things.

AITA for refusing to help my step sister with her house purchase and telling her and my step father that it's because of how they treated me as a child?,"I'm 29F. When I was about 10, my mom married my step father. I have an older brother Luke who was 15. My step father had Amy and Ada who were 12 and 11.

We didn't come from a privileged background, my mum was a min wage worker and my dad was absent. Our step father had a very good income. Their deal was that they wouldn't combine finances, and they would each contribute equally to the household, and then each takes care of their children with their spare money.

So my mum never had anything for us, and my step father was spending big on his kids. This included holidays which Luke and I were excluded from (step father would pay for mum, but not us). Luke and I also shared a room even though Amy and Ada had their own rooms and we had a guest room, because step father insisted that he was paying more towards the house so my mum's share would only get her one room for the kids. Luke and I were constantly teased for this situation by the three of them as we grew up. My mum always said that we should be thankful because if it wasn't for our step father we would not be living in a nice home in a good neighborhood. 

Anyway, Luke and I became determined to be able to take care of ourselves so that we wouldn't need to take nonsense from anyone. We have both done quite well with our careers and finances and we are in a very good place. Since turning 18 and moving out my relationship with the three of them has been very limited. I wouldn't call us friends, but we can exist peacefully if we are in the same place.

I visited my mum recently and my step father mentioned that Amy wants to buy a house now that she's pregnant. He asked me if I'm able to help out a little with the deposit. The house is £500k and she needs a £150k deposit. She has £100k so far. £25k on her own, £25k from her mum and £50k from step father. He was asking if Luke and I can help cover the extra £50k and he said he'd pay us back as part of the inheritance eventually.

I said no. He insisted that Luke and I both own our houses outright and with our incomes so we should be able to help. I said whether I can or not is irrelevant, my answer is no. He reminded me that Luke and I each gave £10k to our cousin for buying a house as a gift, Amy is my sister and he's offering to pay us back. I said that was our choice then, this is my choice now. He insisted that we should be willing to help out our family if we're able to, I replied back ""like how you helped me and Luke when we were kids?""

Everyone just went quiet when I said this. After a while, he said if we went back in time he'd have done things differently, treated all four of us equally. I said that's good of you but doesn't make you entitled to my money now. He said he knows he's not entitled, that's why he's asking and promising to pay it back, I said the answer still is no, not entitled to a loan either.

I M37 have been with my fiancee F37 for 2 years. We're getting married soon, I've only met her family a couple of times. My daughter ""Judy"" F16 has never met them til very recently where they hosted dinner to celebrate 4th of july and that's when they met her for the first time.

Judy has a visible burnscar on her forehead. It was due to an accident she was in when she was 9. She used tk be incredibly insecure about it. To the point where I was forced to home school her and it was hard trying to deal with and navigate through this rough time. Now she's doing a lot better though some comments can really cause her to become stressed out and anxious. My fiancee knows all that and respects it. Before we went to her parents house I asked her to tell them about Judy and her struggle and get to try and not say anything negative about it or possibly mention it. She said she would guarentee no one will say anything.


We got to the event and they talked to Judy and she slowly warmed up to them. Everything was going well til I was dinner time. My FMIL looked at Judy while she was eating and pointed at her scar. Basically asking questions about it which made Judy lose her appetite and start to get uncomfortable. I kept sending my fiancee and her mom signs to knock it off but to no avail. Finally, FMIL then brought up the wedding and asked my fiancee if it'd be possible to ""photoshop"" the scar out of any wedding photos that will have Judy in them just in case they distract viewers. I was dumbfounded, fiancee said nothing just stared casually while nodding. I looked at Judy and it was clear this got to her. I leaned closer and asked if she was feeling uncomfortable and that we could leave if the answer was yes. She took her time then nodded and said ""yes, I'm feeling uncomfortable right now"".I got up and told her to get ready cause we were leaving. My fiancee, her mom and the family started insisting we finish dinner and stay but I refused. I took Judy and got in the car and left before even talking to my fiance.

Obviously, she was pissed. She called an was angry talking about how I disrespected her parents by taking Judy and leaving in the middle of dinnerand not even ""saying goodbye"", i told her that Judy was feeling uncomfortable with FMILs comments and questions. She said Judy overreacted and is in need to go back to therapy if a simply mention of her scar caused her to react that way. I got tired of arguing and asked her to give us some time but she went on me and said that I have no respect for her and her family and that what I did was irrational and now she won't speak to me til I clear things up with her family after ruining their celebratory dinner.",30483,vss2sc,"NTA.

AITA for not asking my MIL nicely to hand over the baby for feeding?,"

Hi. I'm a new mom, had my son 5 weeks ago. my husband's parents have been staying with us and things have been super overwhelming.


MIL has a habit of taking the baby and refusing to give him back to me. She'd say I'm deliberately ruining her time with him. My son needs feeding every 2hrs and she basically makes me beg her to hand him over to me so I could feed.

last night at 10PM. MIL had my son in her arms while sitting on the couch with my husband and his dad. I was exhausted, the baby started crying. I told my MIL to hand him over to me so I could feed him. She refused and I kept asking. my husband starts talking about what a whinny little girl I was to complain that our son is receiving love and cuddles and how I'm using feeding as an excuse to keep the baby away from his mom. I ignored him and told his mom to hand over the baby. she refused and said I needed to wait a little longer.

I got angry at this point, My husband said I could take the baby after I ask his mom nicely. This had me seething I meanly told his mom to stop being annoying and overbearing and hand him over to me. She looked at me shocked and hurt. She handed the baby over and ran into the guest room and my husband gave me a look than followed her and stayed inside to comfort her.


He came into the room while I was feeding my son and started yelling about how disrespectful I was to speak to his mom this way and treat her poorly when all she's doing is showing our son more love than I do. I told him about how she's been taking the baby for hours and preventing me from feeding him properly. he said that 1, our son isn't an object for me to act like I own him and 2, his mom was doing nothing wrong and 3, I should've asked nicely instead of being a bi$ch to his mom and making her cry. I started crying and yelled that I'd go to my mom's place if his parents stay any longer and he yelled back saying ""shut the fuck up, you're only acting up cause you don't want my parents around! fuck's wrong with you?"" then walked out. I felt terrible thinking maybe I was rude to his mom but I also think that I'd hit my limits here.

AITA for having my kids wear tie dye when with their dad?,"I (30 F) my ex-husband (31m). Got divorced 5 yrs ago. During our divorce we owned a old single wide mobile home (1973). On a large piece of land that is zoned for a trailer park. 
He wanted the new truck and our savings. I wanted the old trailer and the land.

My ex and I have 2 girls (8&7).
Since my divorce. I slowly started buying old single wides and restoring them. Turning it into a business. I love it. 

My girls go to their dads and AP apartment  every other weekend. I started noticing their clothes, electronics, toys were not coming home. At first I thought their dad was just keeping a few outfits there for them. However, my 8 yr. old got upset when she was packing. I asked her what was wrong. She told me her dad takes her clothes and sells them on line. That she doesn’t want to take her favorite shirt over there.

I immediately called my ex. I asked him to return our daughters clothes. Not wanting to throw my daughter under the bus. I blamed it on them not having enough for school. He played dumb. He said he got rid of the clothes that were too small. I pointed out that the jeans our (7 yr.) had were brand new. He then said that it was only fair he got some cash because he owned the trailer and land. If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be doing this good.

I was pissed. I took my daughters down to the dollar store and bought cheap shirts.
To a thrift store and bought cheap shorts.
We had a “girls” tie dye night. Hot pink every thing. Each made 5 shirts and 5 bottoms. I let our girls design and decorate them. My girls loved it. 

The following week Ex sends the girls home. I could tell he is mad but, he didn’t say anything. The clothes were not returned. No fear I knew this would be a issue. We made extras. When the girls went back they were wearing tie dye.

They were with their dad for a hour before he called and demanded different clothes. I kindly told him that our daughters love those clothes (they really really love tie dye). Ex get even angrier and said his parents have a major family party and the girls can’t wear pink tie dye. I told him that he should go buy other clothes if he didn’t want them to wear it. 
He called me an A for being petty.
AITA?

AITA for dropping my freeloading brother off at our aunt's house after she called and scolded me for evicting him?,"My older brother (OB) is... a bit of a bum. It's mean to say but it's true. He can never hang onto a job for longer than a couple years max and when he inevitably loses whatever job he had he starts mooching off family and friends until he can find another job months later. This entails him freeloading at their place, eating their food, using their stuff, etc. He's lost friends because of how long he bummed off of them and I don't blame them for cutting him off.

Well this last time he lost his job he went to our parents but they didn't have room because they were letting our eldest brother's (EB) family stay with them after he and SIL lost their jobs out of nowhere within the same month (EB's entire crew was laid off with zero warning and SIL's work burned down) and they couldn't afford the home they were renting anymore. So OB was pretty much SOL. So our parents, aunt, and uncle all started calling me asking if I'd take him in just long enough so he could get on his feet again.

I (stupidly) let myself feel bad for him and said okay, but he only had a few months to get another job or he was out on the street. They all said of course, of course and so he came to stay with me. And it was a nightmare. He's a slob. He NEVER washes dishes, never washes his clothes, and eats pretty much whatever he wants. I guess since I'm his little sister he figured he could ignore me saying to get his shit together. Well after 6 months I told him he had to go. And gave him a couple weeks to find somewhere else.

Well it seems he called our parents and cried about me kicking him out and they told him he knew he couldn't stay forever but they also ofc called my aunts/uncle and told them all about it. And my busybody aunt called me and scolded me for ""being cruel to my brother"" and ""abandoning family when they need help"". I let her talk and finally said she was right, helping family was important and I'm glad she showed me that. She seemed glad I ""understood the right thing to do"" before hanging up. So I followed her advice and packed my bro up and drove him to her house. I couldn't take care of him anymore (he was running all my bills up) but my aunt made a good point, family should help each other.

So I dropped him off there (she has room since all her kids moved out) and then left. But I wasn't even halfway home before I was getting multiple calls from my parents and aunt. Parents were demanding to know why our aunt was blowing up their phones and aunt was leaving voicemails shouting at me to come back and get my brother. I explained to my parents and they said it was a good idea since aunt sounded like she wanted to help but my aunt called me an asshole and said she didn't want my brother there. And when I told her family helps each other she called me a cunt. Last I checked he's still living with her. AITA?

\-

Sorry for my lack of replies! I answered what ones I could before I left for work and when I got back I had far too many to answer.

Lots of people have been asking similar questions so I thought answering them here once would be helpful.

1. My brother doesn't work menial jobs, he's not just hopping from one minimum wage job to another. He's working Very Good paying jobs. Like electronic repair, automotive maintenance, etc. He's very skilled but lazy.
2. No my aunt hasn't spoken to me since she called me a cunt then hung up on me.
3. My brother has only been with her about 3-ish weeks. He stayed with me for 6-7 months.
4. My brother was upset I was kicking him out initially but in a better mood when he realized I had another place lined up for him to stay. Not sure how they're doing together since I haven't talked to either since after I dropped him off.
5. No my aunt isn't married anymore, her and my uncle got divorced and he lives with his new wife (but I heard from dad that he thought this all was hilarious).

\- Edit 2 -

To everyone who has been hounding me through PM and in the comments, my brother isn't (last time we checked) neurodivergent nor does he have ADD or ADHD. Our mom took him to the doctor more than once around when he was 15-17 when his behavior was at its worst. 

According to our mom the doctors all said he was perfectly healthy and fine, though they (the doctors) suggested he wasn't being mentally stimulated enough (aka he was bored?). Mom wanted to take him to see other doctors but by then he'd turned 18 and refused to go and she couldn't force him.

Also its been suggested he maybe see a doctor now but my OB doesn't seem at all interested. He's never had the highest respect for doctors or mental illness. He treats it like it's fake. When our baby sister was diagnosed with an ED when she was 19 he just cracked a joke about her just wanting a doctor's note so she could eat more...",30245,sgpy7n,NTA. I like your style.

AITA for going home after I got told to sleep on the floor?,"

I'll preface this by saying that my husband (33) has a friend ""Carl"" (33) who he considers to be one of his closest friends. My husband sometimes calls Carl his ""nicotine"" because of how much he misses him and wants to spend time with him, they do everything together, they're even co workers working the same job.


Unfortunately, Carlos's wife passed away from cancer 3 months ago which caused him to distance himself. My husband felt devastated for him, he recently started spending more time with him and brought him meals and new clothes. 

We planned a 3 day vacation to another state. I made a hotel reservation for 2. Unbeknownst to me, my husband had invited Carl to come with us, this made me upset because it spolied the entire vacation (not trying to be dramatic) I only found out when he went to pick him up. I sucked it up after my husband explained that Carl is a recent widower who's been wallowing in grief for so long and needed this vacation. The problem is money is tight and since Carl hasn't worked eversince his wife passed he couldn't pay for his own room and we didn't have a budget for it.

My husband said we should just share one room and I again sucked it since he said we'd be out all day on the beach anyway. First night, I was in bed when my husband and Carl got back, I got woken up by my husband telling me to get out of bed and sleep on thd mattress he put for me on the floor and he and Carl would take the bed. I asked if he was serious and he asked what else is he supposed to do, he said Carl was a guest we can't let him sleep on the floor and at the same time I can't share a bed with Carl while he (my husband) sleep on the floor. I told him I didn't sign up for this but he told me to suck it and tried to pull ""Carl is a widower"" card. I told Carl to get out then got up and got dressed to go home. My husband started yelling me calling me irrational but I wasn't having it. I left the hotel and traveled back home. Carl didn't say anything when he saw me leave except that I was making this non-issue an issue.

They got back and my husband refused to even talk about but still said I ruined this for Carl and us and acted abhorrently and disgustingly. I admit Carl is struggling and I mightve ruined this for him but I didn't even know he was coming.",30126,uuo7wb,NTA. Your husband has a better relationship with Carl than he does with you.

AITA for throwing my sister and her son out of my house?,"I (35M) am a single father of 3 boys (10M, 7M and 3M). Their mother died last year due to ovarian cancer. It has been a rough year to say the least. My sister got divorced 6 months ago and temporarily moved in with me and the boys. She has a son, my nephew (9M) who stays with us most of the time. My nephew and my 10yro are not the best of friends, but so far they got along fine apart from some teasing from both sides. 
A few weeks ago my 10yro started telling me that his cousin was bullying him and being mean to him. He called him names, pushed him around, took his video games etc. I talked to my sister many times and told her to talk to her son, we talked to the boys together and things settled down. 
Yesterday was my 3yro's birthday, so my whole family was here and my late wife's family as well. It was extremely emotional for everyone, because it was the first birthday since my wife's been gone. The boys (10yro and 9yro) started fighting again and I asked them both to calm down and behave. My son started crying and told me his cousin teased him about him not having a mom. I choked up and asked my nephew if that was true, and he said yes, but that he's sorry. I figured I'd have a proper talk with him and my sister after the party, so I just told him what he said was really awful and he cannot say it again. I comforted my son and we went back to the party. 
Before we cut the cake, my sister came yelling at me, saying I had no bussineaa disciplining her child. I told her to drop it and we'll talk later, instead she said ""besides, he's right, kids need a mom"". I had tears in my eyes by that time and she just said ""see, it's even turning you into a pu**y"". 
My in-laws were crying, I was tearing up, the kids were upset, just awful. I told her to stop it and just leave me and the kids and the family to cut the cake and we will talk in the evening. She said ""listen we both lost our spouses, but at least I'm still a normal person"". She stormed off. After the party I told her she has 2 days to pack her shit and leave. 
She is begging me not to throw her out, because she and her kid will be homeless. 
Aita for throwing her out?

UPDATE: my mom agreed to take my sister in temporarily, and my nephew is still going to his dad's because now his dad is saying that there's no way he's letting my sister ruin their kid. 
I want to thank you all for your kind words and all the love and support. Also, to everyone who also shared about losing a loved one, I am so so sorry for your loss. 
My nephew is supposed to leave tomorrow morning, my mom is picking my sister up right around that time, and my inlaws are bringing my boys back in the evening. We'll have a little post-birhday thing for my little one when they come, just me, the boys and my inlaws. Just some ice cream (he said he prefers it over cake) and a few cartoons.

"AITA For Making A ""Pregnancy Jar""?","
My husband and I have been married for 6 years. Still don't have kids (we want them but it still not happening). Friends and family are causing us constant stress about having a baby soon but it's obviously something we can't control. We only wished that they'd stop but to no avail.

So what I did was come up with idea (stupid I know) and that is have an empty jar and call it ""Pregnancy Jar"". I carry it with me in my bag whenever I'm with friends and family and everytime someone asks about when my husband and I are gonna have a baby, I pull my Jar out and ask them to drop a dollar in there for asking. I'd get puzzled looks but they reach out for their pockets/wallets/purses and pull out a dollar and out it inside the jar. It actually worked because most of thrm stopped asking after 4 months.


Last week we had dinner at my parents house, My brother came back from his business trip that lasted a month and while we were eating he asked when me and my husband were going to have a kid. My husband paused, I got up from the chair and made my way to where my brother was sitting with my jar in my hand and asked him to drop a dollar for the question he asked, he stared at me then laughed nervously asking if I was being serious.  Everyone was looking at us. He said no, he didn't have to pay me but I told him he didn't have to ask either so here we are!. I could tell he felt embarrassed he immediately reached out to his pocket, pulled out his wallet and put a dollar in my jar. I made my way back to my seat and sat down and resumed eating like nothing happened. It got awkward afterward. Mom pulled me into the kitchen later to tell me that I embarrassed my brother infront of his wife and family and said I should quit acting childish by running around with a jar demanding others to put money in it, I told her they should quit asking then. She went on about how they're just worried for us since we are in mid 30s and don't have much time left if we want at least one healthy baby. I got upset and she started arguing. My husband and I left and we haven't seen them in days, except I got a call from my sister basically siding with mom and the others saying I'm being childish.


So AITA for this?



[Edit - Q&As... ]

(1) this has been going on for years but in the past year it has gotten worse. 

(2) I already told them about how I feel regarding this question, my husband doesn't care much and says I should let it go too.

(3) Yes they pay everytime because it's just a dollar, it won't make me any richer or them any poorer.

(4) My husband and I spend the money on snacks to eat every night when watching tv or some toys for the dogs.


One more thing... I realize that this could actually be expanded into wedding jar/Cake jar (for weight loss)/work jar/house jar/ and so no and so on. Depending on the the type of truggle because these are the things we struggle and get frustrated with often but.. with the fact that people will just keep asking then we might become millionaires one day. Lol.

Also, someone suggested I up the price to 5$. It will mostly depend on the prices of gas, lol, so we'll see.",30009,ufbbvv,"NTA

"AITA for throwing away the elf on the shelf and ""ruining Christmas"" for my kids after my husband's prank?","For context, this year was the first time we would try the ""elf on the shelf"" with our kids. We have 3 kids, Lucas (9M), Andy (8M), and Claire (5F). Where Lucas and Andy are from our past relationships. However, Miles (my husband M37) has accepted Andy as his, and so did I (F35) with Lucas.

Every Christmas is special for Andy, his bd is on Dec/24.  His dad started a tradition where Santa would've consideration with him for being a ""kid of Christmas"". So he feels magical and special. I always try to give him that. Last year, i left ""Santa Claus"" footsteps, ate a carrot and ""grass"" he left for Rudolf. Stuff like that.

My husband doesn't think it's a good idea i do all that for him, and I'm showing favoritism. So, we should shut it down, because of my ex's decision to create a tradition without considering my other kid's feelings. I disagree since i do consider the 3 of them. But he asked if we could so smth else, like the Elf on the shelf. I had no problem with it, but I didn't know how that works. He explained me quickly, and since he was the one who offered, i let him do it.

We bought the cute Elf. My kids named it ""Bob"". Later my husband explained them they should behave, and never touch/hold Bob if they don't want it to be naughty. At first, it was cute to see them spy on Bob, try to see it ""fly"" each night. Andy was the most excited of all, i found him one night talking with it, asking it if Santa still remembered him.

But my husband took seriously the ""Behave or Bob would be naughty"" part. Lucas was his first victim after he didn't do his chores. The next day, his face was drawn with sharpie markers. Then Claire, who touched Bob and her fave onesie was destroyed. Apparently, Bob had cut some pieces of it, while she was sleeping. Miles was having fun, but i could see my kids weren't. I talked to him about how we should lower the pranks, he agreed but wanted to catch Andy since he hadn't break any rules. I told him that Bob's supposed to tell Santa instead of being naughty. We argued but he finally agreed.

Fast forward, it's Christmas Eve and in the afternoon we had some of Andy's friends to celebrate his bd. So the kids were playing in backyard. But my husband looked sus. I decided to look for Bob. It was supposed to be in the kitchen but it wasn't there, I asked Miles where it was and he told me ""no idea"". I started getting paranoid, but Andy asked me if we could cut the cake already. I put my best face on and went for it. The cake was in a box, and when Andy opened the box. He starts crying. I take a look and it's ruined. ""Bob"" was covered in all of it, appearing he had been eating the cake. Half of the cake wasn't there anymore. Miles starts laughing and so did some of the other parents.

My blood is boiling and i grab Bob and throw it in the trash, Then i grabbed Miles. We have a terrible argument, calls me an AH for what i did to Bob, that I've ruined it, how are we supposed to keep the ""magic"" with our kids if i wasn't supposed to touch Bob.

Edit: Hi everyone, so the response has been really overwhelming. I'm sorry if it took me some time to answer i was kinda avoiding the post, since i was conflicted by the possible outcome. I'm going through all your comments, so i can answer some of your questions. I'd also explain things you all have doubts in common.

1.-Andy's dad is from Canada, he visit's Andy every spring, summer and on Christmas break. This year he stayed for his job, so he isn't an absent parent.

2.-After Andy's bd i told Miles to get out of the house, and so he did, he spent Christmas with my in laws. I stayed with the kids, and all of them slept in Andy's room. My kids didn't want to leave his brother alone. The next morning we opened the gifts and i made sure that Andy could feel special after what happened on his bd, so i wrote a note from ""Bob"". Saying that he is sorry if scared him and his siblings, he didn't do his job correctly so now he would be flying to the NP with Santa. And when he asked if Santa still remembered the kid of Xmas, he did. Santa was really happy to see him.

3.-My kids and i, are ok, we are sleeping at my parent's house. And we would celebrate NYE here too.

4.-Yes, Claire was usign the onesie while she was sleeping. My husband took the idea out of Tik Tok. And no, Andy, did nothing to even be ""attacked"" by Bob.",29815,zx49l5,">Then Claire, who touched Bob and her fave onesie was destroyed.

I'm sorry, what in the ACTUAL FUCK is wrong with your husband? This is fucked up and sadistic. If he doesn't see what's wrong and express EXTREME remorse, idk how you can reconcile this. He's harming children. For fun. Does he experience empathy? You are NTA. These are pranks he would do in a frat house with teenagers, these are not appropriate for any children. You don't write on a child's face, destroy beloved comfort items, or ruin a birthday party to teach kids to behave.

AITA for embarrassing a lunch thief at work.,"So pretty much the title, I don't think I am the A but I've been getting some flack for it so I really want to clear this up.

So I started a new job recently I work in small studio, there are several others in the building, think open plan office with sections assigned to each studio. The person I had an altercation with doesn't work for my studio just FYI. 

I eat lunch at 1ish and most people eat at 12. I came down ealry to eat at 12, I made coffee and while at the counter noticed my tuppaware in the sink, empty. 

Imagine my surprise when I turned around and saw a man I didn't know sitting down at the table with my food on his plate. He had just stuck it in the microwave. Acting rashly since I was mad, I sat down next to him and said 'hey that looks good, mind if I try it?' Then before waiting for an answer I yanked the plate away from him and snatched his fork out his hand, he just blinked in shock as did the other people there as I started eating.

He then, quite loudly, asked what I thought I was doing and I replied 'huh you know this was actually much better when I first cooked it, it probably lost some flavor in the fridge.' he caught on quickly that it was it was my food and went a lil red. I then asked him where he got the gall to steal someone else's lunch and then ask them what they were doing when they took it back.

He stuttered out some nonsense about not knowing it was mine and I replied well you knew it wasn't yours right? He just mumbled something like an apology and I said that's no problem it was nice he'd warmed it up for me at least, in an admittedly b*tchy tone, and then he just got up and left and the people there just stared in silence. 2 of the silent watchers, maybe his mates idk, told me that I was rude to him and that there had been nicer ways to go about it. I told them to think how they'd feel if someone ate their food before saying they should focus on their lunch and I'll focus on mine.

Well it's been a little awkward at lunch since and I have the impression a few people are talking shite about me at work now, maybe I could've been nicer sure. I still don't think I was wrong but tell me reddit AITA

Tldr lunchthief tried to eat my food in front of me I took it back and embarrassed him in front of his colleagues.

Edit: Okay this blew up, just wanted to drop an edit on here to say thank you so much for all the comments, support and awards it's great to know I wasn't completely overreacting. Maybe I shoudl chat tp some people and see if the food thief has struck before will update then if yall are interested. 

Otherwise additional info, I saw some comments saying I should go to hr but my studio doesn't have hr and the perp doesn't work for the same place, we do have a defacto office manager but I don't want to take it any further since I'm still new here and on probation/think my reaction might have been enough. 

Update: So not sure if anyone wanted an update but I finally found out from a a new friend at work that yes the lunch thief has struck before! Apparently everyone wrote their names on their lunch to combat this, and the thief then targeted unmarked lunch or lunch items, guess no one told me ha. 

People apparently starting being petty and standoff-ish to the thief since and he blames me for that lol. Also according to my new friend most were actually very pleased that the thief was finally identified/dealt with.

I was assured that besides the thief in question and his cronies no one thought I was being a b*tch. However, not knowing much about me, assumed I was a very serious or clique-y person from my reaction, which I mean fair, I dress very professionally when most of the office dresses quite casual which probably added to that (think high heels, blouse and skirt VS shorts, graphic tee and slops). I've started to come down to lunch earlier to chat to some people and the office seems to be warming up to me.

So not a drama filled update but I'm very happy things turned out so well and my reputation with my colleagues is off to a good start, thanks again for all of the comments and support think this will be final edit slash update too, thanks reddit :)",29764,socrlh,"NTA

"AITA for cancelling a check of $12,000 that I wrote for my infertile friend for her next IVF cycle over a joke?","


I (F35) am infertile. My ex husband and I tried everything to have kids but it just never happened. He divorced me, went and married someone younger who was able to give him a kid and from what I gather, they're expecting a 2nd child together. It hurts like hell seeing someone else have what I couldn't. I get frustrated with myself sometimes and with family blaming me for basically everything. I turn to my friends for support, Especially ""Alessia"", she's in the same ""infertility boat"" as me but she and her husband are currently trying IVF hoping it'd work.


Alessia asked me for help to pay for her upcoming IVF cycle. I agreed to write her a check of $12,000, I really wanted to help her and the money came with no strings attached. I wrote the check and gave it to her last week. She was very appreciative of it.


The very next day, I got a sudden message from a mutual friend ""Carol"" with a screenshot of the conversation she had with Alessia. Turns out she and Alessia were talking about the next IVF cycle, and Alessia said she hoped the cycle would work because ""she didn't wanna end up divorced, and having her husband go marry someone younger and have a baby with them and another one on the way! While she's alone and without a family at 35! (She's 32). I was stunned and...hurt, I knew she meant me here. But I did not confront her I simply contacted my bank and cancelled the check. In the evening, Alessia called to ask why I cancelled the check and I told her. She went batshit saying she didn't mean it that way and that she thought that this was somewhat an ""inside joke"" between ""desperate infertile women"". She came over with her husband the next day begging I write another check but I refused. An argument ensued and her husband thought I wasn't being supportive of her like when she supported me throughtout my struggles. She left crying and we haven't talked since then. Her husband keeps reminding me (while repeatedly calling Carol a toxic snake) of the date of the next cycle saying they can't have it after I took the money that was supposed to pay for it back!.


Some friends thinks I'm being oversensitive. Carol's on my side telling me to tell them to go to hell but I feel so bad about it. what I've done might just damage our 15 years of friendship. Maybe I shouldn't have cancelled it but I just felt so offended by what she said about me and how she basically mocked my unfortunate circumstances.


so reddit, AITA?


Hello again! And Wow thank you so so much for all this support and compassion that you've shown me. I could feel it through my screen (LOL 😅🤣) I have decided I'm going to put some distance between me and
Alessia. Things have been rough lately and I think that distance is what I need right now especially for my mental health. After reading some comments here I now feel less heavy and more relieved. Doesn't change the fact that I'm still feel completely and utterly shocked by Alessia's behavior. It's a shame having to come to the realization that even those who are supportive of you the most, could cause as much harm.


Oh and by the way, I sent Carol a link for this thread to see what her thoughts were and she just laughed. She was kind of angry I used her real name but relieved that I used a throwaway LOL.",29558,yfm01l,"holy shiiit, NTA.

"AITA for replying to a coworkers inappropriate texts by work email, and attaching them?","
One of my coworkers who I had thought was friendly but that was it (he is married) sent me some inappropriate texts at like 3 am on St. Patricks Day weekend. 

Asking me to come over and ""have some fun"" and saying that he had been into me for a while and knew I felt the same. (I don't, I'm a lesbian but not out at work)

He also sent me a naked selfie that (luckily) cut off right before his dick but ... Dang it was close. 

When I saw them, I was out with friends and was like ""What the fuck... Ok this is a Monday problem"". I have a really strict rule with myself that I don't do work, think about work, or answer messages about work outside of 9-5 M-F. I also don't use my personal phone for work stuff. If someone from work calls or texts and it's not one of the coworkers I see as a close friend and trust to not talk shop on the weekends, I'm not answering... 

And I included dealing with this fucker as a ""workday problem"" so I ignored his message. He sent me several later first saying sorry he was drunk. Then saying he hadn't said it how he wanted to but he was still into me and had a feeling I felt the same. 

On Monday, I wrote him an email on the work email saying:

 ""Hi 'Coworker'

I didn't send the email to HR but I did blind CC my personal email so I'd have a copy just in case. 

And he got really mad, he texted me back saying I had crossed a line attaching his picture to a work email, was I trying to get him fired? 

I screenshot that text too and attached it to an additional email saying ""As per my prior email, please only contact me about work matters, and only on my business email or Slack."" 

He stopped texting me but he came to my desk to speak to me and before he said anything I asked ""Is this a work question?"" And he said I knew what it was about, and I said that I wasn't available for a discussion at the moment, if he did need to meet with me for a work matter, could he please schedule a meeting on the calendar and include a readahead to brief me on the topic of the meeting? 

He walked off... 

I feel like I was a bit of a bitch in dealing with it when maybe I could have told him to cut it out by text. But I'm also fucking sick of dealing with this shit at every job, and I feel like my patience to use my own time and energy to gently ask guys to cool it is worn thin. And I want to set the precident that I won't engage at all, outside of work hours or work accounts.

AITA for sending that email?

---

Edit... 

Looks like the overwhelming majority of y'all think I need to go to HR to get ahead of this. I was considering holding off to see if he cools it himself, but the way he came to my desk after being told off twice makes me think that's probably not the best idea. 

I'm gonna forward the emails to HR, write up the conversation we had at my desk, and ask them to meet with me to discuss.

Edit 2... 

 I sent an email to HR this afternoon and they called a meeting with me the same day. I told them everything, though there wasn't a lot to say that wasn't already captured in the emails. And they assured me that I wouldn't have any more contact with him at work. They are going to meet with him tomorrow. 

It's still not decided if he will be fired or if he will be moved to a different position where he won't have any reason to speak to me... I have a feeling it might depend on how he handles the conversation with them? 

I do feel good about emailing HR, I feel like along with myself, I've possibly helped out other women by starting that paper trail if it turns out to be something he's done more than once.

Edit 3...

Holy shit.. I went out to happy hour with a few of my female friends in my field to vent.  And one of my friends told me she'd met this same guy at a professional conference, given him her business card with her phone number, and he sent her a nasty pic too. 

She just replied saying that that was inappropriate and she had a husband, and he said something about her husband not having to know. So she had her husband call him and leave a voicemail telling him to fuck off, and then she never heard from him again. 

I asked her if she'd be okay sending screenshots of the text exchange to my HR contact. She was, and she even wrote that she met him at a professional conference where he was representing the company, she gave him a business card for networking reasons, and he sent her an unsolicited lewd picture. And that she needed her husband to intervene to stop the harassment.

I haven't checked my email again, I'm trying to leave work at work and not dwell on this any more tonight. But it seems like HR will have even more to go off, before meeting with him.

Edit 4...

He was fired. I don't know a lot of details, I have a follow up meeting with HR soon, but my coworkers told me he was escorted out of the building this morning. One of my coworkers who sits near the HR office said they heard him screaming at the HR staff during his meeting this morning... It's crazy how stuff escalated honestly, just last week I thought he was a chill guy. 

I owe a thank you to everyone who told me to report this too; I'd been on the fence at first. But I feel like stuff was gonna escalate either way and I feel a lot safer not having to see him everyday at work.",29514,tmem01,"NTA.

AITA for still going to my dental appointment after my husband tried to get me to reschedule?,"

So I (f34) was having a horrible toothache, I'd taken medication to ease the pain but it was bad, like you-need to go-to the dentist level of bad. I scheduled an appointment and was told to come yesterday.

My husband's (m37) best friend ""Terry"" (m33) got into an accident and injured his knee. he has been staying with us for several weeks. My husband looks after him as he sees him living alone and in need of assistance. I welcomed him to our home but found myself having to clean up after him and bring him his medication and also cook for him. And if I take a long time to get something done he'd call my husband and basically ""tell on me"" which makes my husband mad. he says it's temporary and also since I'm home 24/7 and he is the working then I should help caring for his friend. It has became quite overwhelming because now I can't leave the house if my husband isn't there with his friend.

Like I stated previously about the dental appointment, I told my husband the night before and he pitched a hissy fit saying I can't leave Terry home alone. I suggested he take time off work and stay with him but he said it wouldn't work with such a short notice. he suggested that I reschedule but I said no, even showed him how bad the swelling was, yet he told me to hold on for another day.

He went to work early and I decided I was still going to go. Terry was in the livingroom (he sleeps on a large mattress in the living room) and saw me making my way out as mom was waiting at the door. He asked where I was going and I told him to the dental appointment. He had an attitude and raised his voice at me telling me to go back upstairs and cancel. mom stepped in and started arguing with him asking who he think he is, he went on about how he was unable to move and then threatened to call my husband if I stepped a foot out the door. I took my mom and left. He ended up calling my husband who then tried to call me over and over for 2 hours til I turned my phone off.

Instead of returning home, I went to stay with my mom because I was in tremendous pain and my husband started yelling at me calling me stubborn for still going after he told me to reschedule and irresponsible for leaving his injured friend home alone. Mom told him off which escalated the argument between us. He is now currently staying at home along with his friend while constantly pressuring me to stop hiding behind mom and come deal with the results of having him leave his job for hours after I blind sided him and went against his wishes.

Edit: autocorrect.",29391,v0bel6,"NTA. The complete lack of respect both of these men have for you is breathtaking. A grown man *tattling* about not being served fast enough? And your husband takes his side? 

I know people hate the ""Reddit tells people to divorce"" trope, but this situation shows such a fundamental lack of care or respect for you. It tells you everything about his character, and the character of someone he's chosen as his ""best friend."" I don't see how you come back from this.

By the way, severe tooth pain is an urgent issue. People have died from dental abscess complications. I don't know if that's what was going on with you, but your husband was literally willing to risk your health to make his asshole baby friend happy.",4717,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v0bel6/aita_for_still_going_to_my_dental_appointment/
"AITA for interrupting my husband's ""Live stream"" and going off on him after he ""forgot"" to feed and change our daughter's diaper?","

My f32 husband m35 I has a YouTube channel with over 14k followers. He's been doing live streaming a lot lately even though I told him that we have responsibilities to take care of. Before our daughter (she's 7 months old) was born he'd stream randomly and spend lot of time with his ""followers"". Answering questions and engaging in conversations. He keeps saying that his followers are good for his mental health and that engaging with them weekly makes him become better at socializing and communicating.


He's been complaining about wanting to do a live stream for days. I told him we'd look at our schedule and see if we could get him some time to make it happen. Apparently, this wasn't good enough. Yesterday I had to go grocery shopping and asked him to keep an eye on our daughter while she was asleep. He said okay.


I was gone for 4hrs but kept calling him to see if everything was OK. He'd tell me she was alright and that she was sleeping. I started getting this weird feeling something was wrong because, she must've had been hungry or needed a diaper change. He argued that everything was fine. I immediately went home and when I entered the house I didn't find him, I shouted his name but got nothing. I went into the bedroom and saw that my daughter was awake and her diaper wasn't changed...and worse was that her bottle was even touched. I was confused I got out and noticed that his office's door was closed. I figured he was doing a live streaming from the noise I heard. I was beyond seething I barged into the office and saw him sitting. I blew up while he was trying to turn his mic off and telling me to stop but I didnt stop. I berated him for leaving our daughter unattended and with no milk nor diaper change. He freaked out on me saying I just ended his entire channel and destroyed his fan base for interrupting his live stream and embarrassing and scandalized him like that. I told him to not say a word but he kept yelling calling me out of control and unhinged. He was almost crying so I had to leave the office.


He kept fighting with me til I decided to go stay with my mom. He started blaming me for ignoring his needs after he already expressed them and that he forgot to do what I asked him and I'd cost him so much. Now us telling to come back home because he misses his daughter.",29244,w1l464,"NTA. He neglected your child for hours.

AITA for “weaponizing my femininity” by crying since the teacher wouldn’t stop another student harassing me ?,"UPDATE at the bottom 


Edit2: Since many people are sending me DMs, me and my dads went to the principal today. Will post an update when the situation is solved. 

Edit: please remove if not allowed mods. I’m talking to my dads today and will ask them to got he principal with me  , the comments here made a little sacred about how wrong this could go and how bad was the situation. Will post an update if things can be posted online. 

Also I’m not in USA, even if this sound fake to you,  here in South America things are really this bad guys. 

—-
For a little backstory, I (15f) lost my mom when I was 5, dad raised me alone until last year when my second dad, whom I call papa, moved to our home. Now we are a happy family of four (me, two dads and dog). 

I’m not ashamed of my family so I never hid it, I’m not really popular at school so I just really told my friends and it was all good. Until about two months ago a boy I’ll call Duncan (15m) found out. 

Duncan started simple with jokes like “wow which one of them is the mom?” Which I promptly told the teacher, Mr.Smith, who was like “He’s just trying to understand, if you want people to understand you have to be patient”. 

Duncan started to escalate with “Enjoy your time here, it’ll get worse when your sinner family goes to hell” and again I went to Mr.Smith who again was “You can’t be prejudiced with his religion, it’s wrong in the Bible. He’s is just trying to understand.”

In my country every class has only one responsible teacher so I couldn’t go to another btw. 

I have many examples but this paints the picture. After two months of that I realized that if I wanted him to stop I had to do it myself. 

So when he started with his homophobic shit at the cafeteria I started to remember the saddest thing I could, all movies where the dog dies. All the sad romance movies. Mufasas’ Death. The Fox and The Hound. 

It didn’t take long for the waterworks to come. I started to bawl. Ugly sobbing while basically screaming at him asking why he said I would go to hell, why he hated me and my dads. Just making a huge scene.  Duncan started to stutter and plead, trying to make me go to class with him and talk to the teacher (wonder why). I just cried louder and flinched when he tried to pull me away. 

The scene was so huge that we ended up  at the principals office. Ms.Yates listened to both sides and she was pissed at Mr. Smith, she let me tell the whole story even when Mr. Smith tried to interrupt me to defend Duncan. At the end Duncan got a 5 day suspension and the principal told me to go directly to her if ANYTHING like that happens again. 

When we left the office Mr.Smith stoped me and told me “I hope you’re happy. You put a permanent mark on a good boy’s record because you decided to weaponize your femininity instead of being a little understanding.” He tried to make me apologize to Duncan but I told him I would go right back to the principals office if he did and he dropped it. 

Then later Duncan’s friends started messaging me accusing me of acting like amber heard and ruining a boys life just because I can. 

I didn’t tell my parents yet because they are always afraid I’ll suffer because they choose to love each other and I’ll not bring anything I can handle to worry them. 

I don’t feel like I’m wrong, but with Mr.Smith’s warning and Duncan’s friends I’m starting to doubt , so AITA?

FINAL EDIT AND UPDATE


Mods told me to update here so the post is quite long, sorry!

First I’d like to thank you guys for opening my eyes to how bad the situation was and how it could get worse, and how I was hurting my dads by not letting them protect me like I want to protect them. 

Now to the update: Sunday I sat my dads down and told them everything, I was crying a bit  in the end since while telling them I realized how heavy it felt to be carrying all this.

Sunday was the first time I saw the angry side of Adam (will just use names since the nickname I use in my language clash with English), not at me like but at Mr.Smith. He saw red but the first thing was reassure me I was not in trouble and would never be for fighting against bullies. Dad didn’t talk much, he seemed so sad and shocked just holding my hand, but Adam talked more than I ever heard about his past. About bullying from teachers, students , church and even family. 

He told me about how cruel the world can be to who is different, how people will try to silent me and minimize my anger and my suffering and to never back down, that I will always have my family behind me. 
He thanked me for loving them so much that I was willing to fight for them, but told me I was the child here, his child that he never imagined he could have and that he would protect me. 

I didn’t realize how much he loved me. I knew he liked me, he is my family, but I felt just as loved as when dad tells me he loves me. It was a very nice and warm feeling. 

Adam and Dad went to school with me on Monday, straight to Ms.Yates office and told her everything; about the texts (I had them all on my WhatsApp), about Mr.Smith and I explained the bullying in more details. 

Their conversation was long and after I gave all the info I could, I was asked to leave to class while they talked and only knew the result when I came back home. 

My dads gave Ms.Yates two choices: She removes Mr.Smith from teaching and do a seminar with the teachers about bullying and LGBT causes that my dads are willing to pay for. Or they remove me from the school, sue the school and go to the local newspaper with the story. 

She choose the first option but asked for a month to find another teacher. Meanwhile she will monitor my class closely and Mr.Smith won’t be allowed to penalize my grades like some you guys feared. 

Apparently Adam has a bit more experience dealing with this shit than I knew. 

But he also explained to me about privilege and that talking worked so well this time because this is a private school that worries about money and reputation and we have enough money to fight, pay for a lawyer and sue. He told me that many of children from public schools, like his childhood, have to suffer in silence because they don’t have the support we got this time.

So, nothing really extraordinary, it all went like many of you guys predicted: Duncan will keep being my classmate but at least Mr.Smith won’t bully any more of us, he was the real asshole in the situation. 

Also my Papa is awesome and a badass.",29222,vfnpcs,"NTA

Go back to the principal and let her know what your teacher said, as well as what Duncan's friends are messaging you about. I know you don't want to get your parents involved, but I'd also suggest you do that. 

As it stands, you can't approach Mr. Smith for non-homophobia related issues right now as well, because I wouldn't trust him to do anything. Speak to your principal, and ask if you can be switched to another class. 

I should note:

> the principal told me to go directly to her if ANYTHING like that happens again

It already has. Your teacher's comments were unacceptable, and Duncan's friends are being horrific. Going to her would simply be doing as she asked you to.",10492,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vfnpcs/aita_for_weaponizing_my_femininity_by_crying/
AITA for getting an entire table for myself after my husband and his mom didn't save me a seat?,"
I'll start this off by saying that I, f32 have been with my husband Bob, m39 for 3 years, married for one. His mom has a habit of keeping me out of most of their functions with the excuse of ""you work too much"". Not true because sometimes I do make myself available but yet find myself excluded. 

Last week. His mom invited us for a celebratory dinner at the restaurant after she completed her recovery. I had to with that day but I ket her and everyone know that I'd be there at 8pm. Bob obviously knew I was coming. 

Thing is, when I arrived to the restaurant I saw that the table was full. All chairs had been taken and I just stood there with complete puzzlement while Bob and his mom just stared at me. His mom then told me there was no place left for me and that I could either have Bob get up and take his seat or .... go home. 

I was so upset but instead of going home I just went and took an entire table for me. Bob and his mom watched with their eyes popping out of their heads like they saw something so shocking... NGL I did get weird looks from the guests but so did Bob and his mom. It was awkward in all honesty. 

I had my dinner, dessert, then went home. I saw Bob and his mom staring grudgingly while I was making my way out. He got home an hour later and yelled saying I embarrassed his mom infront of her guests. I yelled asking WTF was I supposed to do after I got denied a seat and he told me that it wasn't his nor his mom's fault guests arrived ""before"" me and took all the available chairs. I told him he could've saved me a chair!!!!!. he said that I could've just left instead, and reminded me that I was a ""guest"" and that I shouldn't expect this level of entitlement to be ""accepted"". He then went on about how I ruined the entire dinner for him and his mom with what I did and has been pouting about it for days now.


I don't get it, I really don't. was my expectation really that entitled? I mean as his wife he should've saved me a seat. But clearly I'm missing something here.",29162,w77sl5,"Nta

AITA for going home after I overheard my husband say he didn't want to bring me with him to his family vacation?,"
My husband goes on annual vacations with his family. I'm on okay terms with them but since we've only been married for a short time and I don't see his family much, we still have that barrier that keeps is from being completely comfortable around each other.
His family arranged for the vacation last week. I out of curiosity asked if I could come. My husband felt hasitant but I told him it'd be a great opportunities to get to know his family better. He agreed to take me and his family were surprised to see me but still welcomed me.
On the 3rd day of the vacation. His dad, mom, brothers and spouses were all sitting at a table outside talking while I was preparing a fruit salad. As I was making my way back I overheard my MIL say ""...did she really had nowhere else to spend the weekend?"". At first I had no idea who she was talking about so I kept on walking, but stopped once I overheard my husband say ""l KNOW!!!! And I didn't want to bring her with me but what was I supposed to do?!!! You know how pushy she can get"". I instantly figured it was about me. I felt so shaken up to the point where I almost dropped the salad. This whole time I was there I cleaned, cooked, looked after the kids and this is how they think of me? An inconvenience to them?.

I quietly booked a ticket and went home on the first plane. He called and texted but I didn't respond anything other than let him know I was home. He got back and went off on me saying what I did was disrespectful and juvenile. I told him I overheard the conversation he had with his mom but he said that I was wrong for eavesdropping and that his family will warm up to me on their terms so I should stop pushing to be around that when they don't feel comfortable with it. Basically saying it was my fault for coming along in the first place. He said that going home like made him and his family disappointed and gave them a really bad impression about me.

AITA for celebrating my birthday which is the 1 year anniversary of my nephew's death?,"My (25F) nephew (4M) passed away 1 year ago because of cancer. It was right on my birthday and there was no celebration, there was nothing, because everyone was devastated. 

My sister Denise is still grieving, she's in therapy and making some progress, but it's been slow. My family and I try to be as supportive as possible. 

Birthdays in my family are very important, we throw huge parties, I believe and have been taught that birthdays are important and should be cherished. 

Yesterday was my birthday. Obviously I felt bad about the anniversary of my nephew's death, but I was also a little down about not being able to celebrate like I used to and my girlfriend knew that. 

In the morning, I went to Denise's house, stayed by her side until almost lunch time, when my mother would stay with her (we didn't want to leave her alone, but no one could stay all day). 

I went to work and at night, my girlfriend made a surprise at home with a candlelight dinner and a small cake. Something very intimate and for both of us, since my family was in a bad way. 

I didn't post on social media, but my girlfriend posted a picture of us holding hands and the dinner she made with ""Happy Bday, Love"". My mom and Denise follow her on Instagram. 

I woke up the next day to hundreds of texts from my mom and Denise, asking if I was celebrating even though it was such a sad day and how heartless I was to celebrate knowing my sister was in such a bad way. Even though I said it was a surprise, they called me cold, heartless and insensitive to the pain of others, saying I should have refused to celebrate. 

I was just glad I celebrated, because it's something important to me and I didn't even realize when my girlfriend posted this photo on insta.

"AITA for uninviting my cousin, brother, uncle and dad to my wedding over a prank?","

I f22 grew up in a family where men prank and tease each others. eversince my fiance (Tim 23) and I got engaged, my cousin, brother, dad and uncle joked about running some 'tests' to see what ""type"" of man Tim is. They've done stuff like forcing him to play chess 4 times in a raw, secretly slashed his tires to see if he'd fix it himself like a man or get help like those ""lazy"" guys, They'd asked him questions like what joke he'd like to tell his future MIL, his opinions on abortion, jesus, gender equality etc. They also tested his fishing and hunting skills, overwhelmed him with hypothetical scenarios to test his decision making abilities/mental strength. They kept calling him slow and soft but he has medical condition (asthma) but they think he's making 'excuses'. I demanded they stop, but dad said this is just typical stuff men challenge each others with and said that I was ruining the fun.



Last week, They took Tim on a 3 day trip and hid his inhaler, he left them and returned in 7hrs and told me, I was seething after he said they admitted to hiding it as a ""challenge"", I exploded on them when they returned. Cousin asked if ""little timmy ran to me to tattle"". I yelled that all 4 of them are uninvited to my wedding. My brother freaked out saying it was a prank and they were going to give it back, Dad said they'll apologize if I insist but Tim will have lost the little respect they'd gained for him and in their eyes will always be ""the soft college kid"" who's not up for the challenge. I called him and the others awful then I left. 

My cousin is begging that we talk, my uncle has been quiet, but dad is so mad and now he's getting mom involved to get me to reconsider this decision. But I keep refusing to re invite them.

"AITA for sending an invoice to my wife's cousin after she ""didn't have space for us"" at her wedding?","I own a printing company that I run with my wife. Her cousin came to us and wanted us to do all the signage, banners, guest books, life-sized cutouts, etc for her wedding. 

We do this all the time for friends' weddings and events, and we never charge. We're happy to help out and it's usually a lot of fun working together to make some cool stuff.

A few weeks before the wedding, her wedding planner tells us they need all the items by X date so they can set it up for the wedding. At this point, we hadn't received our wedding invitations and didn't even know when the actual wedding was. 

My wife texts her and tries to clarify when the wedding is and if we missed the invitation somehow. Her cousin replies and says ""Oh we downsized the wedding and we decided to have like a close friends and family thing"" and that they didn't have space for us in the small venue.

My wife and I are pretty hurt and insulted. And on top of it, we've spent close to $2000 on all the materials. Her cousin and the wedding planner kept making tiny revisions to the artwork, had us print samples to see how it would look in person, resized several of the items a few times, etc. All that cost a ton of time and money. And we're a functioning business, so we either had to delay other orders or stay late and print her stuff on our own time.

So I went ahead and billed her for our cost and said we needed payment before delivery because I'm not going to chase her for payment for months/years after the wedding. We're not making money on it, just charged her for the cost of materials. 

So far we've gotten threatening calls from the cousin, her fiance, some random members of my wife's family that I don't know, some of the groomsmen, etc essentially calling us assholes.

After the harassment, I'm considering charging full price or else we won't deliver the items.

"AITA for calling my brother a “disgusting gross, man,” at his daughter’s birthday party?","Throwaway.

My brother, “Paul,” and I are not close at all. We have very different worldviews and have incompatible personalities. I can tolerate him, but I would never consider him a friend. He’s been married to “Lisa,” for one or two years now and they have a beautiful daughter together.

My girlfriend, “Amy,” and I were invited to celebrate my niece's first birthday. Most of the family was invited, and it would be the first time I would have seen them all together (I only see my family once or twice a year, with a few exceptions.) 

Amy and I arrived a little earlier than we were supposed to and instead of waiting in the car, we decided to go in. The first thing I noticed is how calm my brother seemed to be in contrast to Lisa, who was frantically running up and down. When he saw Amy, he immediately handed the baby over to her and got a beer to sit down and watch TV. Lisa was clearly struggling, and he was content with a beer and Netflix. 

I don’t want to be rude and maybe this was a one-time thing but it bothered me how uninvolved he was. He handed Amy a baby with a full diaper with vomit on its clothes.

Eventually Amy, Lisa and I finished everything. The house was clean, the food was ready, and Lisa looked ready to host a big gathering. We all paid zero attention to Paul. 

When my family arrived, I thought everything was going well. I avoided Paul and enjoyed speaking to my family. After we had sat down to eat, Paul approached me, drunk, thanking me for helping Lisa. I did not want to be around him for long and moved out of his way.

He was very persistent.

I was ignoring him but he started talking about Amy. “Protect Amy like a “real” man.” or “You’ve got a great woman by your side.” You know what, whatever. It was slightly odd and mildly uncomfortable, but I was able to brush it away. Amy was trying to sober him up a little bit before the cake-cutting so she was “selectively hearing.” 

We tried to get him to stop talking and drink water. However, he had a lot to say about Lisa. He was complaining about how pregnancy “ruined” Lisa’s body and how a baby ruined his life. Amy and I kept looking at each other awkwardly and we were soon going to leave him be. 

We didn’t leave the conversation soon enough.

He was complaining to be about his sex life, or lack thereof,  and commenting on how desperately he wanted to have sex with someone “fit like Amy.” 

This made the both of us extremely uncomfortable. Amy left, quickly apologising to Lisa. I told him that he was a “disgusting, gross man who needs some fucking help,” before I left. 

Apparently, this made him super upset and he started wailing at the party. Paul told everyone that the reason he was crying was because of my words to him.

AITA for telling my SIL she can leave Christmas dinner when she freaked out over tampons?,"Okay, she’s not my SIL yet but I used it to make the title simpler. She’s my boyfriend’s borther’s girlfriend.

I (f28) have been with my boyfriend (m32, Ian) for 3 years. We’ve decided to host a small, early Christmas dinner. One of the people invited was his brother, Jake (m26). Jake asked if he could bring his girlfriend as she was all alone (they’ve been together for 3 months) and we agreed, the more the merrier. His girlfriend, Naveah (f28) seemed a bit timid but lovely. Naveah brought her 8 year old son (that we didn’t know was coming).

She seemed lovely right until she went to the bathroom, she came out shrieking,box of my tampon she in her hand, literally gasping for air in between her shrieks. I could barely understand her. Turns out, my box of tampons was visible (duuuh, it’s within a reach because hey, I need it monthly, why should I hide it and then look for it). She was going off about being disgusting, how could I be so shameless to have this in front of a child and other men and so on.

I looked at her in disbelief, I couldn’t believe she made a scene about a box of tampons, has she never been in a shop?

Anyway, I told her that my tampons stay where they are but if she’s so pressed, she can leave and go home where no tampons are present. She turned red, quite literally, her face was bright pink. Huffing and puffing, she dressed her kid and told Jake to drive her home which he did.

Jake didn’t come back but he called from her house telling Ian that I was the asshole. I was surprised to hear that Ian (my boyfriend) agreed with him. I thought he would be on my side. We were about to argue but I decided it wasn’t worth it and went to my office to cool down and think this through. Am I the asshole for telling her to leave?",28732,zv5h8o,"NTA—this stranger came to your house and insulted you. She’s hardly a member of the family after 3 months of dating your boyfriend’s brother.

AITA for telling my boyfriend that he can't date younger and then get upset about my budget apartment?,"
So I recently got together with a guy from my hobby, he asked me out first and I had some doubts that we'd work together as a couple because of the age difference, he's 35 and I'm 22.

So, in my apartment, since it's an old house that was originally a single family house, there isn't much soundproofing. And the floors creak when people move. 

I've gotten used to the sound of the guy upstairs getting up at 4 am since he starts work at 5.

And the sound of the girls in the apartments to either side of mine watching telenovelas till midnight, taking work calls all day and having friends over on weekend nights. 

I know when I play music or have friends over, some of the sound leaks through the walls. So I'd never get upset about hearing my neighbors because it goes both ways. 

So... When my boyfriend started coming over more often, he had complaints about the neighbors. Which put me in an awkward place, he wanted to go speak to them or have me text them and I said no. 

For example, one of the early times he stayed over we went to bed around 10. He wanted me to ask my neighbor to turn down her TV. I said she didn't have it that loud and she turns it off at midnight anyway. 

At 4 am, he got very irritated with my upstairs neighbor getting up and cooking breakfast. I said that he would be done by 5 because that's when his shift starts. 

At 7 am, he was still trying to sleep in and the neighbor on the other side had some work calls that he said he couldn't sleep through. I offered him earplugs and he said he couldn't sleep with them in either, he wanted me to ask her to quiet down.

He had similar comments every time he heard someone else in the building just living their life especially if it was when he was in bed. 

I got frustrated with my boyfriend and told him ""you know, you can't expect to date a 'hot young' 22 year old and not wanna deal with a 22 year olds living situation! I don't know if you realize but this is a normal apartment for someone my age... Hell, my neighbors are pretty great; nobody's throwing loud parties on work nights, nobody's having screaming fights, nobody's having babies!"" 

(The 'hot young' part was in sarcastic air quotes because those were his words not mine)

He got irritated and asked why I was bringing age into it, and I said it's because he can't both want someone so young and also want someone with house kinda money! And he was being so out of touch with how normal people in their 20s live.

He got really irritated with me bringing age into it, and even more annoyed when I'd respond to his neighbor complaints in the future with ""ok boomer"" or tell him that if he wanted me to have a ""rich person apartment"" he could pay for it. 

AITA for what I said to my boyfriend about my apartment?

Edit - A lot of comments are asking if we could stay at his house

It's not possible for me to get to his house on my own because I don't have a car and the buses don't go that far into the suburbs. 

 So that would mean him driving 30 minutes from his house in the suburbs to pick me up, then an extra 30 to drive me to his house. Then an hour round trip early in the morning to get me home in time for work. 

It's a lot easier for him to visit me in the city.

Edit 2 - a lot of people in the comments are saying Technically 35 is a milennial and not a boomer. I know that.

 I am using boomer as A JOKE or a figure of speech to say ""acting out of touch and entitled to tell other people what to do"". It is a common figure of speech to say ""ok boomer"" to someone who is acting entitled regardless of their actual age... It's more of a mindset thing.

Edit 3 - I googled his property records for his house and HE CO OWNS IT WITH A WOMAN WHO SHARES HIS LAST NAME! holy shit... I don't know if she's his wife or ex wife or what but I'm OUT OF HERE. I'm honestly freaking out right now but I just gotta say .. great big thank you to everyone who noticed red flags and made me question that. I've blocked his number, he can have fun figuring out where I went.",28669,sp8vjk,"I have to ask...have you EVER been to his house? I could be wrong but the whole setup sounds like a huge red flag.

AITA for what I said after my husband commented on my flat chest?,"

My husband Jared and I have been married for 3 years. He's currently out of work (used to work at a high paying job but got kicked out the company over a fight with a co worker) and I'm the one paying for rent and utilities.

We dedicate some time to see his family weekly. They don't know he's unemployed because he thought they'll see him as a failure especially his mom so he told me to keep it a secret.


Last night we were sitting eating dinner at the table. His cousin was talking about his fiancee going to brazil to do a boob job. Jared asked if he was serious then ""flattered"" FSIL's boobs saying they're perfect and that he didn't understand why she'd get a boob job. He then turned to me, stared at my chest while I was eating like an idiot (I have a flat chest, I'm insecure about it but can't do anything about it obviously) and said ""Hey why don't YOU get a boob job, you're the one who needs it the most"". His mom gasped and was like "" JARED!?? "" I said ""It's fine!""  I then turned to him and said ""I'll get a boob job once YOU get an ACTUAL JOB since you've been unemployed for 6 months now$!!"", He stared at me in disbelief. his mom began questioning him about being unemployed and he denied denied denied then admitted it was true. It got awkward with his mom scolding him and others shaming him for it and for hiding it. He got so overwhelmed he went outside and stayed inside the car til I came.

He started yeling at me repeatedly ""you coudn't have held your effing tongue?!!"", And accused me of turning his family against him and having them jugge then shun him now he can't even step a foot in their house from shame and guilt. I argued that his comment about my chest was insulting, but he said he was giving me a piece of advice and that there is nothing wrong with him wanting me to look pretty and that he said what he said out of support and encouregemnt, but I what I did was the complete opposite and that it was intented to hurt him and I succeeded.


He dropped me off at home then went to stay with his buddies. I called him later thinking he calmed down but his friend said he didn't want to speak to me and I shoud give him space.",28666,u6ec6m,"You were just encouraging him to get a job :)

AITAA for taking my niece to court over a coat?,"I(28F) have a niece (16F). She is my only sister's only child.

2 years ago I married a very wealthy man (34M), and because of the pandemic, last Christmas was my first with my in-laws.

My MIL gifted me a coat that is worth more than $20k (I saw her wearing it, asked her where she bought it, and she said that it will be my Christmas gift from her).

I didn't know how much it was (I knew it was expensive, but I thought maybe $3k at most). I was visiting my sister last January when my niece saw it, she googled the brand and showed me how much it really was. I won't lie, I didn't wear it after that because I was afraid of ruining it.

Last week, I wore it while visiting my sister. While I was putting it back on to leave, I felt something go *splat* on my back, then my niece started cackling and the smell of paint hit me. I was so pissed off while she was not apologitic at all. Her mom screamed at her and said she was grounded. Then she said she will pay for the dry cleaning.

While I was in my car, still in shock BTW, I got an alert that my niece posted a reel, it was of her *doing a prank* on me, and she said ""I'm going to hit my aunt's $20k coat with a paint filled balloon to see how she reacts"". I saved it on my phone, sent it to her mom and told her that a week's grounding is not enough. She did not reply, but I saw that my niece took it down (it got less than 5 views by then).

The next day I found out my coat can not be saved, so I called my sister and told her that her daughter has to pay it back. Well, we got into an argument and she said that they will not be paying it, and if I wanted a new one, I should get my husband to buy it for me. I think that they should pay for it (they can afford to, IMO they should sell my niece's car and pay me back my money). 

We did not reach an agreement, so I told her that I will be suing, and reminded her that I have video evidence that her daughter A) did it on purpose for online clout and B) knew exactly how expensive it was.

People in my life are not objective at all, I have some calling me an AH, some saying they are the AHs for not buying me a new one, and some so obsessed with the price of the coat that they are calling me an AH for simply owning it and wanting a new one.

So AITA?

Edit: sorry for not making it clearer, but my coat was bought new, just identical to my MIL's.",28641,za73bi,"NTA. This is a really good way for your niece to learn that actions have consequences and hopefully will serve her well in the future, when she's older.

AITA for still going to my sister's wedding after my husband canceled my plane ticket?,"
EDIT - UPDATE ON MY PAGE - 

Here's the situation. My husband [36] and I [30] have 3 kids [2, 4, 7] . I'm a sahm (full time) and I take care of the kids while my husband works (full time).


My sister's wedding was last week. We live hours away which is an issue for my husband. When we first got the invite he told me that he wasn't going, that he will stay for the kids and suggested I do the same. Since the wedding doesn't allow kids and my husband doesn't want to hire a babysitter after the one we had robbed us. We had gone back and forth on this. but I insisted on going since that's my only sister and I want to attend what might be a once in a lifetime event for her. He chuckled at my statemtment then we stopped talking about it.


As the wedding was appraoching, He brought it up and told me to miss it and stay with the kids. I suggested that since no babysitters were allowed then, I could get my friend to stay with the kids but he refused. I ignored him, spoke to my friend who agreed to watch the kids and booked a ticket to travel to my sister's town in time.

My husband found out and went on about how he had work, and that the most logical solution is that I stay home with the kids and let him make his living. I told him that I already took care of the kids and they'll stay with my friend. Honestly? I grew inpatient. The day of my flight I dropped the kids off at my friend's place then headed to the airport. I found out he had canceled my plane ticket. I was upset but still insisted on going so I went home and got into my car and drove 4hrs to get to the town.


At 5pm. My husband called and was freaking out on me asking where I was. I told him I made it to my sister's town and he blew up saying I wasn't supposed to go, even said he canceled my ticket to get me to stay. He demanded I return but I said not until the wedding was over. He called me horrible, neglectful mom then had his mom scold me and accuse me of abandoning my own kids. There was a huge argument ensued when I returned home and my husband kept on saying I was horrible to leave the kids and to ignore him like that and do what I wanted eventually. He's giving me silent treatment as of now and I can no longer take it. I felt guilty and did NOT enjoy the wedding AT ALL.


Was I wrong for still going?



[INFO] My husband dislikes my sister if it's relevant.


UPDATE: So a lot of people on here brought up the possibility of my husband lying about the robbery that happened months ago and accusing the babysitter of stealing just so I can't hire any other babysitters. He was the one who discovered the ""robbery"" I never saw or talked her after he kicked her out. Upon reading the comments I'm now suspecting that he made this whole thing up. I'm going to contact the babysitter to get the whole story from..Hopefully I'm wrong but I will talk to her and see if her story contredicts his in any way.

I'll keep you updated.",28563,x9109y,"NTA.

AITA for showing up to my husband's Dr appointment?,"
My husband has been dealing with sone health issues the past few weeks and has been frequently visiting the dr. I asked if I could go with him but he refused saying it wouldn't be neccesary and when I asked why he wouldn't want me with him he said he felt more comfortable having privacy with his doctor. I jokingly asked if his doctor was a women and he glanced at me.


I anticipated his next dr appointment and decided to go meet him there. He went and 10 minutes later I entered the office (I identified myself as his wife) and he was shocked when he saw me. I greeted his doctor (a man lol) and we talked but my husband refused to even look my way and refused to speak as well.


We left the office together and he went off on me in the car saying I shouldn't have ""followed"" him and came into the dr office after he asked me for some privacy. I said it was alright I'm his wife I already even know what his issues are and just wanted to show support. He said I overstepped his one boundary and refused to respect his wish and made him more stressed than he already is in these hard times he's going through.

AITA for keeping the engagement ring and giving up asking to propose (after propose) in front of my parents and in-laws?,"My (25F) girlfriend, Molly (26F) for the last... 6 months started with a joke that I've already made clear that I don't like. It consists of her saying ""No"" quickly to anything I ask.

 I know it sounds silly, but I ask her to get a glass of water for me, she says no and after 1 minute, I'm almost getting up, she says she's joking and gets some water. I ask her to wash the dishes, she says no.... I say I LOVE YOU, she says no... I ask her to take her clothes, she says no. Everything is joking and after 30s/1min, she does it, but she is ""addicted"" to doing it.

 I've already made it clear several times that I don't like it, even more so in I LOVE YOU (she's the only person I can say that, so it's special to me). And there are things that are serious and I need her to answer seriously. And if she says no to everything jokingly, I can't tell when she's saying a real no (it's already happened). 

I keep saying this is boring and I don't like it, she stops doing it and goes back to doing it after a week. After a brief discussion because she played this prank in front of our friends (Me asking ""love, can you get me some medicine?"" and she with No kidding), she stopped doing it for 1 month. 

Yesterday, we welcomed my parents, in-laws and our 2 best friends to our house. Everyone knew that I was going to propose to her and I called them, because we always planned this proposal with our loved ones attending, participating in this special day. 

I asked her to marry me and she said a quick NO and I was so grumpy/panic/upset (everyone looking in shock) for 30s for her to laugh and say she was joking, finally saying YES. 

I was so embarrassed and…disappointed? I put the ring box back in and said I'd take it out to cool off. I didn't even let her say anything. 

She kept texting me (no answering calls), saying it was just a joke and that I knew she always did that. She said that I left an difficult situation in the house because it was very clear that I had given up on propose and did in front of my parents and in-laws. She stressed that I was making the situation uncomfortable because of a silly joke. 

Well, I slept in a hotel and I'm still in it. 

My parents supported me, but my in-laws calling me AH for giving up on proposing, disproportionately humiliating their daughter.

 I just really think there's time for jokes and that moment wasn't clearly, she knew I didn't like it and decided to do it anyway. 

AITA?",28449,wloe2s,"NTA.

Out of all the things that are wrong from her side, one that stands out to me the most is that afterward she still puts the blame on you and does not even apologize. If you see that your partner is hurt by something you did (yes, even a joke) any well-adjusted human being would apologize.

Also, if other people are not laughing, I wouldn't even call it a joke. And you are correct to think that there is time and place for jokes. I can imagine how hurtful and embarrassing it was to hear the ''no'' to your proposal in front of your family. Such a dick move.

AITA for throwing out my husband's dinner after he went to eat at his mom's house?,"
My mother-in-law calls every night to ask what we're having for dinner. Then she brags about what she's cooking to make me look bad, especially if we're getting takeout. I used to care but not anymore. But my husband would ask me to make dinner only for him to go eat the dinner his mom makes at her home. which's 10 minutes away and using the ""that's my favorite meal"" excuse.


Yesterday, I wanted to surprise him by cooking one of his favorite meals and although I was busy, I took time off work to cook. I even went grocery shopping to get what I needed. Later as I was setting the table his mom called, I told him he didn't have to answer but he did. like usual...she asked what we were having but acted surprised that I cooked this meal. She then went on to tell him she cooked X meal and told him to come over. He said ok which shocked me, I said ""seriously?"" as he started dresing up getting ready to leave. he told me no offense but this meal (that his mom cooked) was even more of a favorite than the one I cooked. and grabed his keys and left.


I felt awful. I took his plate and threw it out then ate my portion. As I was about to put the plate in the dishwasher, he got home looking angry saying his mom lied about cooking that favorite meal, and used it as an excuse to force him to eat dinner with her. I was shocked but he sat down telling me to go ahead and reheat dinner. I told him no dinner after he abandoned it, I threw it out. He said what?? and I told him he disrespected my time and effort and chose to go eat woth his mom instead. He began yelling at me asking if I really did that then called me petty and horrible then went upstairs saying what I did was 100 times worse than what his mom did.

I definately feel like I let my anger and frustration get the best of me but it really felt unbearable having to live like this for so long. By the way [I'm 26 and he's 28].

ETA to make one thing clear and that's the fact that my husband only does this when it comes to food. He lived with his mom (attended community college) and loved and still loves her food and is used to it. She gave me recipes to make and I try to do that but he keeps switching homes just to eat what he feels like.



**UPDATE** Hi 👋 I posted my situation here almost 24hrs ago and haven't really read every single comment because - Wow there's just too many. I saw few pieces of advice and encouregment and I'm so so thankful for them 💝. But just wanted to let you guys know something since this is a throwaway account and I will be abandoning it soon. I just wanna let you know that I will be sitting down with my husband soon (after he breaks the silence I'm just giving him the space he said he wanted) and I'm going to show him this post in hopes he'd see how none of this was my fault. I will also be pushing for couples counseling although he's always been against it but we'll see how things go...I'm not gonna lie I still feel upset and like my efforts aren't being appreciated, His mom is definately onto something with her little upsetting stunts. I realize how important boundaries are - but also realize how enforcingbcan he difficult. I'm hoping and praying that we will tackle this issue so that our marriage won't suffer but if he's still somehow unable to do his part then that's on him and I'm no longer willing to go through similar stuff and just take it you know.


So yeah, This is it. I honestly didn't realize my post was going to gain this much attention.

AITA for returning my daughter's birthday cake after I discovered that my wife made changes to it?,"I (M37) have a daughter (now 13) ""Olivia"" from my former relationship. Currently, I'm married to my wife who has adaughter (16) ""Britney""


So, Britney is the opposite of Olivia. for example, Britney s a social kid, Olivia is introvert. the list is long but they're just the complete oposite.

Olivia's 13th birthday was 2 days ago. She loves chocolate and I decided this is the flavor I was going to go with when I contacted the bakery. However, my wife objected since Britney absolutely hates chocolate and suggested we go with Vanilla. I said no way because for one, Olivia hates vanilla and it's also her birthday so, she gets to have her cake with her favorites flavor. My wife got upset and took it as in I had no regard for Britney and that we should just choose another netural flavor instead. I shut that down and said no more discussing this because I'd already decided to go with what Olivia wanted.


At the day of the birthday, I was supposed to go get the cake but I was surprised to see my wife coming home after picking up the cake from the bakery. I looked at it and discovered that it wasn't a chocolate cake but a vanilla cake with small pieces of chocolate on top. I got pissed thinking they got my order wrong and was about to contact them, but my wife said there was no mistake and that she called the bakery the day before and made ""slight changes"" to the cake to please both girls. I was stunned I lost it on her and asked why the hell she did that. She got defensive saying that birthdays are no ""excuse"" to show favoritism and that her daughter is ""watching"" and ""observing"" how I'm treating both girls. I told her off since I was the one paying then called the bakery and explained what happened. I had the cake returned and replaced with a chocolate cake. although this one is smaller but it was fine.


My wife declined to take part in the celebration and later we got into a huge argument where she called me controlling and selfish for returing the cake instead of using this opportunity to teach Olivia to compromise so everyone's happy. now I'm teaching her to be ""selfish"". I said that my daughter gets to act ""selfish"" on her birthday and that she (my wife) was teaching her daughter to be entitled. Word for word and it led to a bigger argument. We're not talking as of now.

I have found, with abusive people, they often accuse you of doing what they are doing.  Right here, she is randomly telling you that the daughters are seeing how you treat them - makes me think she knows Olivia sees the shit she's been pulling, stuff you haven't seen, and knows she's in the wrong so is totally putting it on you.

I would sit your daughter down for a heart to heart honest conversation and ask what she's been going through since the marriage.  Take her out to a nice hot chocolate place.

 I would then suggest heavily you go to family therapy.

AITA for tricking my in-laws into trying my food?,"This isn’t necessarily my proudest moment but I am tired of being the outcast.

My (32f) husband “Pete” (34m) comes from a family where the women are all bakers. I am a baker myself and I used to sell out of my house under my states cottage laws but stopped because I like it just being a hobby.

His SIL “Kay” (39) is the one who is “known” for her cupcakes and cake pops.  When I first met everyone years ago, it was the first thing I learned.  Everyone talked about everything she made.  Even when Pete mentioned how good my stuff was, everyone would say that Kay sells hers and they’re popular so they must be better.  Whenever I bring treats, they are often left untouched because “they are not Kay’s”.  Yes, I’ve been told that.  They ask me to bring something every get together and never touch it.  

To be clear, Kay is mainly a baker whereas I bake and specialize in professionally decorated cakes.  Kay says that overly decorated cakes are compensating for their bad taste and Pete’s family agrees.

We had a BBQ Monday for Memorial Day and everyone made their treats.  Kay decided to bring cake pops. She posted them on her Instagram the night before.  So, and I know this immature, I made the exact same ones she did, same flavor and design. 

We got there and everyone asked where my treats were.  I said they’re in car and I’ll get them in a minute.  So I waited for everyone to be outside then I brought mine in and put them next to Kay’s.

After we eat, I notice the family eating my cake pops and not Kay’s.  She didn’t notice at first and then asked if they weren’t feeling cake pops.  They said they just ate them and they were the best she ever made and asked what she did different.  MIL even said they looked so much better in person than in the picture.

Kay was confused and said hers were still on the table.  That’s when I said, “Oh, I brought those.  Glad you enjoyed them.”

Her husband said he hadn’t had one yet (lies, he ate two) and everyone else just said “yeah, they were okay.”  Kay didn’t say anything the rest of the night.

Pete thought it was funny (he didn’t know what I did until the reveal) but his brother (Kay’s husband) said yesterday that what I did was mean and I’m just mad that Kay is a better baker.

WIBTA If I didn’t go to my brother’s wedding over a bridesmaid dress?,"I’m currently in medical school and live across the country from my brother/family. I was surprised when his fiancé asked me to be a bridesmaid because I barely know her, but she wants to have all siblings in the wedding. I made it clear that their wedding was during my final exam week, and while I was able to get an accommodation to take my last two exams early I still wouldn’t be able to help much with planning or be present at things like a bachelorette party/bridal shower. She said this was fine, it would mostly just be to have an even number of bridesmaids to groomsmen and for pictures.

There’s a group chat that was created months ago that I would read through every couple of days to get updates on things I needed to do, namely to order a bridesmaid dress. Links were sent with three styles to choose from and we would be updated on colors later. So a couple weeks go by and I ask what color to order, bride says she still thinking about it. Couple more weeks go by and she's still thinking… then a couple more weeks. You get the idea. Now it’s at the point that if I don’t order this dress in a couple of days it won’t be here in time. So I ask on Saturday what color. No response in the group chat to me.

I asked again yesterday (Sunday) what color do I need to order? Then I’m flooded with messages lambasting me for not ordering a dress yet, from her sisters and my sister and her. My sister called me, told me to “get my sh\*t together” and “order a dress already” because my lack of preparedness is causing the bride intense anxiety because she doesn’t think my dress will be here on time for the wedding now. She texted me this morning, “don’t forget order your dress, love you” with smiling and kissing emojis.

Still, no one has told me what color! I’ve scoured the group chat for a mention of dress colors or an image of a dress but only the maid of honor sent a photo of her dress and I don’t know if she has a special color. There’s thousands of messages so it’s not simple to find anything. Everyone else can meet in person so I assume the decision on color was relayed in person. I can’t tell if I’m being purposefully excluded?

About an hour ago my brother called me pleading with me to work things out with the bride because she’s panicking about me. I tried to explain this to him and he told me he doesn’t care, its a petty ladies issue, and since I’m not there for anything else this is the least I can do because the bride thinks I don’t like her because I wouldn’t come to anything. He’s taking her side. They know I’m in medical school, I have literally no say in my schedule. And I’m on the other side of the country, 5.5 hours by plane.

I’m fed up with them and contemplating telling my instructors the wedding was moved and I will take my exams at the regular time. I’d have more time to study that way anyway. I haven’t told anyone in my family I’m considering this. WIBTA?

UPDATE: I called my mother and asked her what color the bridesmaid dresses are, she said lavender. The only color option on the website that I would call lavender are named pearly lilac, periwinkle, and orchid purple. I texted the maid of honor (bride’s sister) to ask what dress color and got a multi-paragraph long lecture about not having ordered my dress yet. Basically, they are trying so hard to accommodate me being across the country by including me in the group chat. She said she didn’t remember the shade name but its a “dusty purple” then sent a blurry picture of a wrinkled order confirmation, the shade name was “mulberry.” On the dress website that is a darker wine/purple color. I told her this and she said to order the lighter dusty purple color.

I sent her a screen shot with the list of shade names and asked, “which of these?” She said she didn’t know because everyone ordered their dress so long ago and asked for pictures of the dresses in different shades from the website. So I sent screenshots of all the light purple colors. No response for a while so I called her on the phone, which she was upset about because its past 10pm over there now. Her response was “look, I don’t care what your problem is with me and my sister but if you want to stay in good standing with this family you need to get your ducks lined up girly.”

I ignored the lecture/comments and asked: “what color?”

Her response? “Light purple”

Me: “of the three I sent, which one is it?”

Her: “I don’t remember, I’ll have to ask one of the other bridesmaids for her receipt, I’ll get back to you”

I want to bash my head into a wall!

I called my second brother, the one not getting married. He said they’re pulling similar things with him and he feels like he was deliberately given the wrong dates for the bachelor party by the best man (bride’s brother) so that he would miss it. He inadvertently learned about the changed date the morning of and when he asked the best man he told him it must have slipped his mind to tell him. Then joked that he wouldn’t have missed much since he probably won’t enjoy any of the “festivities” anyway. They’ve been making homophobic jokes and comments to him that he’s been ignoring but he thinks they’re trying to get him to back out of the wedding. So if we both back out then there will be an even number of bridesmaids to groomsmen again. Only speculation on our parts of course.

Quick update: I was seriously considering pulling out, but the collective rage here and my fading motivation to study has me thinking… by this point, with how this post took off, I wouldn’t be surprised if they find it at some point so I don’t want to reveal my cards just yet. Thank you to the comments that gave me the idea. I guess I’ll be making an update mid June if it all goes to plan.

FINAL UPDATE

Thanks to some responses, I called the bridal salon and asked what colors were ordered. Four dresses in the color “flint” one in “mulberry.” The MOH was setting me up to believe “mulberry” was the color of ALL the dresses. So, I ordered one in mulberry and one in flint. I only let the MOH know I purchased a ""mulberry"" dress.

I caught a red eye to be there for the rehearsal. They had a room to get ready in the morning and wanted all the dresses stored there. I show up with the mulberry dress. The bride begins crying because it’s “too late to fix it!” She asks if I would be upset if asked to drop out because mulberry is for the MOH.

I pretended like I had made such a big mistake! I said, “I know a girl that works at the salon. Let me call her and see if there’s anyway to make it right, and if not I’ll step down because I want you to have the perfect day.” I show back up the next morning to start getting ready with the correct dress in tow. “My friend looked in the back for me and they JUST had this returned yesterday, what are the odds! Exact style, color and my size, it’s a sign!”

Silence. Then an awkward, “that’s amazing.”

Now I’ll be honest, I thought the revenge would be that they had to have me and younger brother in the wedding and photos. I couldn’t have planned the next part. They had to explain to the makeup artist there was an additional bridesmaid meaning they planned from the beginning that I wouldn't be in this wedding.

The ceremony went fine. We took photos after.

Then, there were no place settings for me and little bro with the wedding party at the reception since banked on one less bridesmaid and one less groomsman being present. The table was almost not long enough, two chairs had to be thrown on the ends. We didn’t get food Initially because we were actually in the seating plan at other tables so our plates were brought to those place settings. I can tell my brother (groom) seems ticked off at the staff for seemingly not having things set up properly but the bride and best man diverted his attention.

Before he (groom) left he found me and said he asked the MOH why the setting were wrong and he was told I asked to be dropped from the wedding party weeks ago then showed up and demanded to be in the wedding.

I said I didn't ask to be dropped and showed him my phone where she gave me a thumbs up on the dress. He noticed the screenshot was not the dress I was currently wearing so I said I had to last minute switch it out after confusion on the color. He seemed satisfied with that.

They left on their honeymoon, and my brother returned several days early… alone. So, you can guess how that went.",28116,uwbmey,I am confused as to why your own sister can’t tell you what color dress she ordered for herself - isn’t she also a bridesmaid?

AITA for being openly hostile towards my sister and telling on her thus potentially making her husband loose custody of his children?,"I'm not gonna be shy about this. My sister sucks. She is a horrible self slcentered person who thinks she is the main character.
She is not only a horrible person, she is a step monster.

She married this guy... Who is a freaking push over... 3 years ago. He has two children. 10 and 6. My sister constantly complains about them. Saying things like the 6 year old is gross because he sips too loud or has stained clothing. For the love of god.... He is 6. That's what a child is supposed to do. And she is so mean to the 10 year old girl. She acts straight out jealous of her. I've caught her taunting her, that daddy loves my sister more than her. She is horrible.

I have straight up called her out (after trying to talk to her like a million times) . At Christmas she was saying, that I'd be nice to have the kids there and I said ""why... You hate them?"". This was when everything was almost over and she had been bragging to her friends that her husband had spend more on her than on daughter. A fight ensued. My parents reprimanded me but my cousins took my side and called her out, noting every moment that they had witnessed her being horrible. Her husband obviously took her side and said, that she was a wonderful step mother and that the kids love her. To which I said that was a lie, as I had consoled them countless times after they were taunted by my sister. They left and we haven't talked since.

One day I was running errands and run into my step nephews who were with their mother. I had never met her... And honestly she is wonderful. We decided to have some coffee. While the kids were playing, she asked me how her children behaved etc. I said they were wonderful and then I just spilled the beans on my sister. How awful she was. What I've heard her say to the kids, the inaction of her ex husband. By the end she was horrified. She said the kids didn't like her. But she always chucked it up to my sister being the new woman In their fathers life. She said the kids never really said anything even when she asked. I then told her iw as very concerned for the children as my sister had straight up told the 10 year old, that it would be better, if she disappeared from her father's life. Their mother saw red and asked me if I'd be willing to ""testify"". She said that this was unacceptable and she would be taking their father to court again. I said I would recount the events that I witnessed and could ask my cousins who witnessed a lot too. She was very grateful. I asked my cousins who were all willing to recount the events. Word got arround to my parents and by extention my sister. And they have been calling me the biggest asshole on the planet who would betray family on a whim.

AITA for banishing my teenage daughter's friend from our house because she made fun of my weight?,"I (37f) have two kids with my husband (41m); a 14-year-old daughter and a 10 year-old son.

Our daughter has always been a little socially awkward to the point that we've had her tested since we suspected her of being on the spectrum. Turns out she isn't on the spectrum; she's just a natural introvert.

However, this year in school we were thrilled when our daughter made a new friend her age since that is an area in which she struggles. Long story short she recently invited her new friend over (with our aproval) to have dinner at our house and then spend the night.

So, my daughter's friend came over. My husband is usually the cook in the family and this night was no exception; he made us all a really nice meal. During the course of said meal I asked my daughter's friend; ""Are you enjoying the food?"" She responded ""Yes! \[Your husband\] is a great cook! No wonder you've ended up a bigger woman.""

The room got quiet for several moments. My husband tried to laugh it off and change the subject but I wasn't having it. The girl had just leveled a completely uncalled-for insult at me. My daughter's friend seemed to realize that she'd messed up but she didn't say anything else. We finished an awkward dinner in mostly silence and my daughter's friend did stay the night.

This was a couple of months ago. Recently my daughter asked if she could have her friend back over and I told her ""Sure; if she's going to apologize to me."" When our daughter asked what I meant I reminded her of what she'd said. My daughter responded that it was over and she didn't want to bring it up again.

She then went to her father and asked. He said ""sure"" but she then told him what I'd said. He came to me and said: ""\[Daughter's friend\]  just felt awkward and tried to make a joke. It didn't land. For the sake of our daughter can't you just let it go?""

Yes, I could, but the thing is that I just want an apology from the girl. I need to see that she understands how rude she was before I can get on board with her and myy daughter hanging out. My husband says that I am being weird for insisting on an apology from a 14 year-old, especially since that girl is such a good friend of our daughter. I think it's weird that I'm still waiting for an apology from that same girl. Seriously. That's all I need. I just need to know that any friend of my daughter is willing to own up to her screw ups.",27988,ze4qw3,"As a bigger woman myself, YTA. Kids say dumb things.

AITA for calling the police on my fiance?,"Last night my (35M) Fiance (38F) left in the evening to give a friend's son a ride back to his home. She implied she'd be home before 9. She left at around 7:45.

10:15 rolled around and she still wasn't home. I texted and she apologized to me, saying that her friend's son was actually in the next town over (maybe 30 minutes away) and she was coming home now.

11:45 rolled around and she still hadn't come home, so I called her to no answer. Texted her to no response. I was getting very upset

12.30 rolled around and still no response and no answer to my phone calls. I was extremely angry. 

1:30 rolled around and my anger had completely transformed into worry. Not answering my calls and texts not read.

Around 1:45 I called the police. I have always heard that the first 24 hours of someone being missing is the most important, so I didnt want to delay. I asked them to let me know if there had been any traffic accidents involving her car, and the operator told me that they would put out the word and send some cops to check along the route she would travel. I called all the hospitals in the area to check if she has been checked in and I waited outside watching the road for her car for three hours, partially because I didn't want the kids to hear me on the phone with hospitals, and secondly because I was sick with worry.

At 7:00am she came home. She apologized for being out and said she had no excuse. She was driving home and felt tired like she was falling asleep at the wheel, so she pulled over to the side of the road to sleep. When she did that, she found that her brand new phone had stopped working. She says she napped anyway because it was the responsible thing to do, and then came home at 7am to bring the kids to school and get to work on time. 

I immediately called the police and told them that she had come home safely and gave them the case number and told them to stop searching, which they did. 

My fjance brought the kids to school and left for work. I set out to start cleaning (cleaning destresses me sometimes), and I got a call from a policeman asking where she worked. I told him, and asked why, and I was informed that it was their policy to check on the person's wellness after a missing person is found. I asked them to not go by her work but to give her a call instead. He said he couldn't promise. 

My fiance is relatively new to her job. A police officer showed up and asked to speak with her. She is now enraged at me for calling the police and 'sending a cop to her work' and making her look bad. She is saying I overreacted and that she wasn't missing and that I was punishing her for doing the responsible thing and not driving while drowsy. She is saying that she is never going to leave the house again except for work, because she is afraid I'm going to call the cops on her again. 

So did I overreact? Should I have waited two days like she suggests?",27973,y1h40p,"NTA. She said she was on her way home at 10:15  pm and then disappeared until 7 am. Of COURSE you were going to call the police and have them go looking for her. If she’d been in an accident or worse, she would’ve been dead if you’d waited two days to call.

AITA for making my SIL feel like shit about her weight?,"35F and my SIL is 46F. I have 3 children, the oldest being 16M. For my birthday last week my son went out and bought me this swinging hammock chair that I had been wanting for 2 years and it cost him quite a bit of his saved money (which I fully intend to put back in to his bank account so he can continue saving). He was so excited to see me open this gift and couldnt wait to help me set it up. I told him he shouldnt have, that it was a lot of money and his response was ""You never get anything nice. I wanted you to have it."" And it was true. I usually dont get anything for my birthday or Christmases outside of Tupperware or soaps. So it might sound stupid but I have cherished this swing ever since he got it for me, especially where I finally have something nice that's mine. 

My SIL comes over once a week to see all of us and she immediately headed straight for my swing (which my son hooked up on our deck). I told her to please not sit on it and she said ""Is there a weight limit?"" So I told her yes, 250lbs and I even showed her the box to confirm. She was not upset about this. She just said ""That's a bummer, they need to make something capable of holding us big girls"". I simply agreed with her and went about my business. At this point my husband shows up from work.

When I went inside to grab us some drinks her and my husband are talking on the porch and not even 5 minutes later I hear a loud crash and my husband say ""Fuck, are you alright?"" I go out and sure enough she had sat in my swing and the crochet netting around the hook snapped on one side, causing her to fall right on her ass. She is sitting there laughing, gets up and says ""I guess i need to learn to listen."" So I lost it. As I said above, I literally never get anything nice. Never. This is the one thing that I had that was mine and it didnt even take someone a freaking week before they ruined it for me. So I said ""I literally just fucking told you not even 20 minutes ago that it would not hold you and to please not fucking sit in it."" She makes some comment about ""Usually the weight limit is a lie. I thought it would hold."" So I said ""The weight limit probably would have held if you were only 50lbs heavier than it, not 150."" (She is 420ish lbs because she is one of those girls who eat food on camera for money and she absolutely loves her weight). But regardless, instead of apologizing or offering to compensate me for my destroyed item, she has resorted to saying I'm a shit bag for making her feel like her weight is a problem and my husband is on her side. ""Its just a fucking swing"". AITA?",27590,vbay7f,"NTA. Your SIL needs to compensate you for it. As well as apologize.

She is heavy. She knows it. She deliberately sat in your swing even though she knew the weight limit was lower than her weight. As far as I'm concerned, she has pretty much broken it intentionally.

Also, any decent person gets embarrassed when they break something that doesn't belong to them, no matter how it happens. Especially if the owner gets upset about it. Instead she is playing the ""you fat-shamed me"" card to get out of the situation.",18481,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vbay7f/aita_for_making_my_sil_feel_like_shit_about_her/
AITA for ruining my brother's date night and having him come pick his 3yo son up after he dropped him off at my house right before my shift?,"

I M32 have a brother M30 (Kevin) who is a single dad to a 3yo, Kevin lives in the same city as me we don't have any family of relatives here just a few friends.



Kevin has a habit of dumping his kid on me at random times to watch while he goes out on dates with women. So far he's gone out for 4 dates while expecting me to watch my nephew. It bothered me because I have work commitments (I'm a nurse) and my schedule can unpredictable, and so he caused me issues at work for dropping his kid off at my house without telling me first.



Last week he did it again, He came over at 6pm and entered my house with my nephew (he had a spare key) while I was showering and left the house immediately. I got out of the shower and was shocked to see my nephew standing there alone. I asked where his dad was and he said he just left. I knew he wanted me to watch my nephew, I called him several times on the phone and he did not pick up. I was so mad and almost freaking out because I was getting late for my shift. I sent him a text telling him to come pick his son up right now or I'd call cops on him for child abandonment. He texted back begging that I suck it up just this time because he had an important date and he couldn't leave in the middle of it. I told him that I was serious and I'd do it and gave him 10 minutes to get home.


He got home looking pissed and started yelling at me for ruining his date and making him leave in the middle of it, just because I couldn't bother skip one damn shift to watch my nephew. I told him I never agreed to watch his son and he made me do it. He said that it was an emergency which made me laugh because calling a date night ""emergency"" is just absurd. Long story short he left with my nephew but hasn't stopped blaming me for spoiling his date and probably causing damage to the relationship between him and his ""potential"" girlfriend.

It's been a week and he's still salty about it demanding I make it to him and call his date and lie to her and tell her some sob story about why he had to leave like that but I said I won't do that.

When we arrived there was a lady with her 2 sons and a daughter, I made eye contact with the lady and just smiled and waved at her to be nice. After 15 minutes or so my sister was playing on the swings because she got scared and didn't want to ride the bicycle anymore 

I looked away for a second to say hello to my uncle since he lives close to us and he was passing by and when I turned my head around to check on my sister I saw she was crying and the lady's sons were using my sisters bike, I approached the kids and politely asked them to please leave the bike alone and use theirs (the 3 kids had brought their own bikes) they ignored me and continued to play with the bike. I decided to go up to the lady and ask her if she could talk to her sons, she responded with ""My kids are having fun and yours isn't using the bike so I don't see a problem"" I then responded with ""I'm aware that she isn't using it, but it's her bike and your kids have their bikes so I don't see a reason for them to use hers"" she then started going on about how I have no reason to talk to her like that if I was going around getting girls pregnant, insinuating that my sister was my daughter, at this point I was pissed and didn't want to deal with this lady so I angrily said ""Lady, she's my sister, and I believe I have the right to talk considering I'm not being a little bitch, so I'm going to ask again, are you going to tell your little rats to get off my sisters bike or not"", she then got up and told her kids to get in the car

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Even though I (23f) am American, my parents are immigrants and therefore I have a different cultural upbringing than most. One thing that was hammered into my head from a young age was to always, *always* bring a small gift when visiting anyone's house. It doesn't matter if it's family or friends or that one person you kind of know but don't really like, bringing something is a must.

My bf (28m) and I have been dating for almost 4 years now and since we both work from home he suggested we make dinner with his parents a weekly thing since we haven't been able to see each other much for obvious reasons. I love his parents, so obviously I agreed! Every week I made sure to bring something small to show my appreciation for them cooking for us (always using my own money); a small bottle of wine, their favorite dessert, some flowers etc. and they always thanked me for it. This has been going on for a few months and absolutely didn't notice anything out of the ordinary until yesterday when my bf and I were preparing to head over.

I'd gotten a cute vase of daffodils since luckily I'd found some in bloom and my bf's mom really loves them, but my bf suddenly got really mad and asked why I kept bringing stuff over every week like his parents were ""a charity case"". Honestly I got super confused and asked him what the problem was and that I've always done this with everyone including his friends since we met. That it was a cultural thing but then he got even madder and told me to stop imposing my culture on everyone and it's weird since I'm white. At that point I didn't feel like going anywhere with him and just gave him the flowers and went for a walk while he drove over to dinner by himself.

After he came home he still had the flowers which he gave to me and told me he was sorry but his parents really were super annoyed with me constantly bringing stuff over like they can't take care of themselves, and later on I got a text from his dad asking me to not come over for dinner anymore. Now my bf's giving me the cold shoulder unless I give his parents a huge apology, but I really, truly don't feel like I'm in the wrong for trying to be nice to them. AITA?

AITA? For blowing up at my husband for lying to me about my sister and her baby leaving when he actually kicked her out?,"
My sister (20) got out of a terrible relationship and moved in with me and my husband and brought her 5 months old son, she's dealing with a handful of issues from ppd to depression. I asked my husband if he'd be okay with her moving in and he said absolutely, not just this but he was the one who picked her/brought her home.


She stayed for 2 weeks and helped around the house, My husband started complaining about the baby crying but a newborn is expected to cry especially at night. He said it causes him stress although I suggested he put on earbuds. He suddenly told me to forget it and so I did.

Last week, I had to go out of town to attend a friend's funeral without my husband, He said he wanted to stay with my sister to make sure she's okay. I returned home the next day and didn't find her or her baby home. My husband said she contacted a friend in another town and wanted to move with them and left that morning, he handed me a letter he claimed was from her. This felt so odd...especially after reading the letter, I called her phone many many times but turned out my husband found it and said she must've left it behind. I was worried I had no means of contacting her to make sure she was okay, I contacted relatives but they knew nothing.

Yesterday, I got a call from an unknown number and it was her, we talked and she told me that she didn't leave on her own but my husband kicked her out after telling her that she was no longer welcome, and she needed to take responsibility for her decisions. I was in shock as she explained that she's not with a friend but at a shelter and she has no money. I waited til he got home and I blew up at him, he admitted he faked the letter an hid her phone then argued that it's his house to and he has a say, but he shouldn't have lied to me about my sister and causing her to be homeless. I he said I was being unfair and wrong to lash out at him for wanting peace in his home. I went upstairs and refused to argue anymore. I told him I'm going to pick her up tomorrow and he said he'd change the locks while I'm gone and I won't be allowed to bring her home. I'm thinking of going to a hotel but he kept saying that I'm letting my sister affect our lives by prioritizing her but there's a baby involved, my nephew and I can't leave him homeless. I get that it's house too but I don't see why he's so against her staying.


Edit:- he returned home and we started arguing again, I couldn't take it anymore I'm going to stay at a hotel for tonight am I'm leaving in an hour or so. He is wanting to talk again now but I'm incredibly overwhelmed and stressed out and need some time by myself. I don't care if he's going to change the locks or not I'm working on meeting up with my sister as soon as possible so we can talk more openly about what happened and hopefully try and figure something out.",27375,tew2yr,Nta.

AITA for “ruining” my sister in law’s honeymoon by exposing her racism?,"Throw away account although my sister in law will probably recognize the story anyway so I don’t know why I even bother. I don’t think what I did was an AH move at all but maybe the timing was a bit off but No, I don’t think I’m an AH full stop


My (f27) sister in law (f30) got married last weekend. She’s my long term boyfriend’s (m32) sister. They’re white and I’m Middle Eastern. And a dark one with raven black hair. She was looking for a photographer that didn’t bankrupt her so I suggested a friend of mine who’s new in business and charged less than half because these things cost over € 5k these days. She was excited and I set a group chat with her and my photographer friend. We talked a little and later they met and they started messaging directly to each other. 

The wedding was amazing and everything went smoothly. I was one of the guests and she seemed happy. The next day they went off to their honeymoon. I don’t know if it was by mistake but instead of texting the photographer directly like she’s done for the past few months she texted him to our old iMessage chat. She thanked him but had a favor to ask him and wondered wether he could retouch some asymmetry in the (flowers archway? I’m sorry I don’t know the right terms in English) but also if he could take me off some photos because I’m too dark and ruined the color palette. Not all pictures. Just the ones she’s in. 

I texted back are you kidding me?

She didn’t answer. I took a screenshot and posted it on my insta story tagging her in it. She called my bf crying her eyes out calling me an ah for embarrassing her and ruining her honeymoon. Bf thought it was a low blow. I was blinded with rage when I did it but even now I’m calm I still don’t feel that I was an AH. But people have been contacting her apparently asking if she really wrote this. She’s so beautiful and successful so please don’t blame it on jealousy or scare of being outshined.

#**edit for a little update**

[update](https://www.reddit.com/user/Throwwaaway22/comments/w220ia/update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

1) Sister in law is still on her honeymoon so I haven’t talked to her yet but she’s bombarding my bf demanding that I apologize and make a new insta story with my apology. More people got involved including my Bf’s mother that thought I was way out of line ruining her daughters wedding. I have also got contacted by my sister in law’s friends, some of them told me stories about what she’s been talking about me behind my back. Yeah she got what she deserved. The amount of her friends that weren’t surprised at all with her text made it clear for me that I wasn’t wrong.

My sister in law is self employed with some foreign customers thats why she’s taking it so hard because she’s scared that would affect her career. I don’t feel like I need to save her career should something bad happen to it.


2) My photographer friend did what he was told. Thats the only right way imo. Being professional and not confuse work with his own values. He asked me if I wanted him to say something and I said no. I also asked him not to tell me what they’re texting since she’s his client so he shouldn’t break confidentiality. He’s just starting his career and he will meet worse brides. She was at least nice to him throughout their interaction.


3) now to my bf. As I said he thought this whole thing was uncomfortable. I told him if he wanted to be with me he needed to discuss uncomfortable topics. He opened up and it was actually deeper than this. This has happened before. His uncle is very rich and for his 60th birthday he had a very big party. As a thank you we received thank you cards with our pictures on it professionally taken. I remember this picture because his uncle had a “red carpet” moment when guests were photographed upon their arrival. Later we went to my bf’s mother to see the rest of the photos and I wasn’t in any of them. I thought it was funny how I literally evaded being caught on camera. I never mentioned this or even reflected on it and while my bf and his family were looking at the pictures and discussing the evening it was just so normal and no one mentioned something out of the ordinary. Today he told me that I was photoshopped off the pictures. Everyone in his family knew it but me. At the time they just thought the uncle could choose whoever he wanted to have in his pictures and they moved on

-but you all kept it from me 

-yes

-so you must’ve thought it was hurtful 

-i did, I asked my family not to tell you

-and we continued going to that uncle. Celebrated some Christmases, Easters and vacations with him?


Silence

-you didn’t feel offended on my behalf?

Silence 

-and now you think it’s okay that your sister is doing the same?

-I didn’t think of it that way I know my sister. She nit a racist.

-if it wasn’t racist why is she feeling “embarrassed” now? 

Silence 


-you think what she did was alright?


-of course not!


-will you just stand and watch when this happens to our children 


-OF COURSE NOT.


I know my bf very well. He’s very kind and I never felt he was racist in anyway. I know he’s not stupid and is aware of these things which makes it worse because it just means he doesn’t care enough. I asked him why he didn’t care enough and he said he was so sorry but he knows me to be a strong girl that never let these petty things affect her. He’s right, I normally ignore 99% of the racism and micro aggressions I face in life and even laugh at the ignorance. We even discussed this before. But does being strong mean that people are entitled to try to hurt me? Because I usually don’t let them? Does it mean I wouldn’t appreciate to feel the support of my bf having my back? Don’t strong women deserve being supported by their loved ones and feeling safe and loved? He couldn’t answer this.

I told him that I never want his sister in my life again or his uncle and probably not his mother either if she still wants me to apologize. I don’t want to surround myself with people like them and especially when I have children and I asked him if he’s willing to live like that. I asked him not to answer me now and think about it. It kinda felt like an ultimatum and thats bad but I didn’t know how to handle the situation better. 

I never thought of myself as someone who’s petty or that makes ultimatums. This experience taught me that I’m both🤷🏽‍♀️

AITA for serving my sister's husband dinner using toy utensils?,"

I, m17, moved in with  you sister after my parents kicked me out for coming out (another story) they said I'll be here temporarily til I get back to ""normal"" which I don't think I will, lol. But uh...anyways, so I moved in with my sister and her husband about a month ago. FYI she does everything around the house (I started helping here and there) as well as looking after a 2 year old niece and now she's 6 months pregnant. BIL does nothing because he's the breadwinner as he claims but imo he's taken it a bit too far. e.g he'd tell her to start his laundry once he takes off his clothes, put dinner on the table once he's home, get the shower ready and so on.


They fight a lot cause my sister is exhausted and burnt out, I usually put my headphones on and mind my own business but 2 nights ago there was a lot of commotion once heart home so I went to see what the issue was. Turns BIL was complaining about dinner and my sister was too exhausted to get up. I mean the dinner was already cooked but he wanted her to put it for him on the table. I told my sister I'd do it, but instead of using their kitchen utensils, I used my niece's toy utensils like toy cup, toy plate, toy fork and knife and a tiny napkin. I put the food on the toy plate and the drink in the toy cup while BIL was in the shower. He then came into the kitchen and sat down and stared at the plate for few seconds. He then looked at me and asked what the he'll this was, and whether I was joking. I told him if he wanted to act like a helpless child, then he might as well get treated like one. He began yelling and my sister came inside. He then threw the napkin and stormed off upon saying that I'd disrespected him and that he'll let my parents know about what I did. My sister saw what I'd done and started laughing. I went inside my room but the argument didn't stop, now he's expecting an apology for me for meddling in his marriage and pulling this crappy stunt on him. I could be TA for this but I was just so mad for my sister and also sick and tired of being sick and tired of the nightly fighting over dinner.",27327,tiy2nc,[removed],5360,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tiy2nc/aita_for_serving_my_sisters_husband_dinner_using/
AITA for losing it and telling in-laws to stop calling me “mama” and trying to erase my identity?,"I have 2 kids, 2f, 4f. I fucking hate how everyone thinks of me as being just a mommy now. I don’t get to be my own person. I’m just mommy.

Husband doesn’t face this. He gets gifts from everyone that have to do with his hobbies. Me? I get a bunch of mommy shit. Tee hee, mommy needs wine! 

And like matching outfits. I don’t mean like, one of those cutesy matching pajama sets that the nurses and horse girls wear in their staged Christmas insta pics. I mean like, people actually think I’m going to go out in public wearing some cutesy matching outfits with my toddlers. As though I think they’re mini versions of myself? Or dolls?

From the time we got to the in-laws, it was “mama” this and “mama” that. At some point, my SIL said it and I said “You know my name is (Carmen), right?” she just looked at me funny and said “Of course, silly?” I said “So why do you keep calling me “mama”? You aren’t going around calling (husband) papa?” SIL just looked at me like I had 2 heads and was like “Um, okay.” 

This went on all over Christmas. Here you go, mama. Want another slice, mama? 

At that point I was just like “Do you guys mind calling me by my name instead of calling me mama?”

The same SIL as before did the whole golly-gee doe eyed thing and said “But you’re such a good mama!”

I said that I’m not JUST a mom. I gestured to the things that husband got for Christmas from them, and said “Why didn’t you guys get him anything that says  “papa”? Everything you gave me is somehow related to me being a mom. Why does HE get to be his own person?”

MIL grabbed my hand and squeezed it and said that she was sorry that she made me feel like this. She was just “so excited” about being a grandma and she never really thought of things like that.

I was feeling a little better until SIL2 and SIL3 started going after me. One of them did that whole “Are you okay? Do you need to talk someone? You sound so angry, it isn’t healthy” faux concern thing that’s meant to shame you for having any emotional response.

The other one was angry and saying that “is being a mom somehow beneath you” and “do you think you’re better than the rest of us?” and all that.

When we finally left, he asked me why I’d kept it in for so long, and I said that I haven’t. No one listened to me before. I’ve said these things plenty of times. I’ve always asked them to call me by my name and not some disgusting nickname that boils me down to giving birth. He nodded, but said that I’d put a big pallor on the weekend and that I need to apologize for the outburst at some point.

I said sure, as soon as SILs apologize to me for dehumanizing me for years. 

We’re at a stalemate. AITA?",27193,zwkcst,"NTA. Your MIL reacted appropriately imo saying she didn’t realize and had no ill intent (which I believe).

AITA for telling my son exactly what my husband did despite him begging me not to tell?,"


I have a son (adam 14) from my previous marriage, I'm currently with my husband of 4 yrs. I handle everything related to Adam's school. He has a friend (Dean 14) that he started hanging out with a year ago. Dean is an amazing boy and has been nothing but a great influence for adam. I met Dean's dad (Mike) who's a single dad and we'd see each other daily for school pickup/drop offs. My husband kept asking about Mike and pointed out that he's being boundary stompping but I disagree.

Unfortunately, Adam fell sick months ago and had to undergo a surgery recently. It's been hard but Dean kept visiting, sometimes Mike would come too and my husband would either ignore Mike or make passive comments towards him. Mike picked up on that and I told my husband to knock it off cause his hostility affected Adam and Dean as well.


Days ago, I found Adam crying in his room, this was weeks after getting discharged, I asked and he said that Dean sent him a text telling him they were no longer friends and blocked his number. I was confused they were fine. I wanted to go talk to Dean but the next day I found his phone in my husband's car. I confronted him and he said he ""borrowed"" it from Dean but I didn't buy it. After pushing he confessed that he stole Dean's phone at the hospital and sent Adam a text telling him to not contact him again. I asked why and he said it was all Mike's fault for being too close to me and acting inappropriately, and said that he didn't want to directly tell Adam to no longer speak to Dean and chose this stratagy to not make Adam hate him while keeping Dean and by extention Mike away. This hit a nerve so hard I started screaming at him. He said he already expressed how uncomfertable he felt with Mike being around and I kept brushing it off. I said it was because of how ridiculous his argument was, Mike has been nothing but respectable and helpful, I yelled calling him insecure and unreasonable and also cruel for causing Adam heartache with his stunt. He begged I don't tell Adam but I took the phone and returned it to dean and exlained to him and Adam what happened.


Adam is no longer speaking to my husband and he is blaming me for telling instead of keeping it between the adults like I'm supposed to.",27188,tu41gf,"NTA. i don't care what mike was doing. i don't care what you were doing. he said he wanted it to 'stay between the adults', and yeah, it should have, but you didn't bring the kids into it, he did, because he STOLE A CHILD'S PHONE TO MANIPULATE YOUR CHILD. 

he STOLE from a child so that he could manipulate and lie to your child. he tried to ruin THEIR friendship instead of nutting the fuck up and being a man and trying to find a compromise, trying to actually communicate instead of passive-aggressively being a dick to mike and you, literally anything that didn't involve trying to destroy a friendship between two children, one of whom was recovering from a fucking surgery.

AITA for cancelling the family trip after I found out that my wife cancelled my son's ticket?,"Situation is a bit messy so bear with me.



I M42 have two boys, Adam 16 & Leo 14. Their mom passed away 5 years ago and I married my wife Rose about a year ago. Rose adores both of my boys but complains about Leo being overly uptight and closed up. It's true that he likes to keep to himself, doesn't participate in most family functions but that's just how he is. My wife has taken it personally and kept saying that Leo clearly doesn't like her and/or doesn't like spending time with her.

What she started doing was try to exclude him from events under the excuse of ""he wouldn't be I interested anyway"" which I thought was wrong because he's picked up on that and started asking why. So I told my wife to just do herpart and that giving him the choice to decide whether he wants to participate or not and not outright exclude him.


I'd been arranging for a family trip and days ago I booked tickets/hotel reservation upon deciding our destination. Note that I was paying for the entire thing. But the day of the trip I found out that Leo's ticket had been cancelled, I was dumbfounded to discover it was my wife who cancelled it, I immediately confronted her and she said she figured Leo wouldn't want to come but she knew he said he'd go, she tried to argue that due to his ""moody personality and introvert nature"" he'd change his mind last minute or go on thd trip but turn it into a miserable experience for us all. I got so mad at her especially after she tried pressuring me to leave him with his aunt. I cance.led the entire trip, all tickets, all reservations everything. She blew up at me and started lashing out. I had the boys unpack and I did the same which made her go crazy and yell at everyone in the house. She went to stay with her sister while exposing what I did to the rest of the family who thought I made a big deal out of it and should've cancelled the trip that I promised the while family.


1#Edit. format and mistakes, I'm so sorry for those.

2#Edit. I am planning another trip with the boys (without my wife) but right now there's huge conflict in the family and even Adam is upset and blames Leo for what happened. I'm trying to get everyone to calm down then we'll see where this goes.

3#Edit. I've decided (and following some opinions here) to speak to Adam to see exactly why he blames Leo for what happened. He just got home and I'm about to get him into a seperate room for a private talk to be able to hear his side in this and find out why he feels this way. If there's any relevant information I will add it below.

4#Edit. I spoke with Adam. Turns out, Rose told him I cancelled the trip after Leo changed his mind ""last minute"" and that I decided to cancel it for everyone else and fought with her when she tried to convince me to go anyway and let Leo go stay with his aunt. This is just....I don't know what to say to be frankly honest. Adam didn't even want to talk but I told him we needed to talk. He and Leo aren't speaking right now because of this and I'm struggling trying to clean up this mess. I was actually thinking about calling Rose but after this I've decided I need more space than she does. I will have the boys sit together (it's hard to do it but I'll try) and talk this put so I can focus on the other major issue I have with what Rose did.",27193,vpox9w,"NTA.

AITA for not telling my cousin my fiance works at the same office as her husband?,"First/only post, I mainly lurk. I thought stuff like this only happened in movies, but it happened and would like some unbiased opinions. More light-hearted than some of the other posts on here.

I have a cousin 'Kat', who got married to 'Henry' early this year. We weren't close as kids - she was pretty spoilt and would always brag about how much designer stuff she has, be really mean to people under the guise of ""just trying to help"", etc. Don't go out of our way to interact with one another but I do see her at family events and whatnot and we make small talk. 

I'm engaged to 'Chris', who is a software engineer. He's co-head of his department at work with two other people - not too long ago, Chris was telling me about how they had some new employees and one of them sounded really familiar, he told me the name and I realized it was Kat's husband. (Also he and Henry hadn't met face-to-face yet)

Kat and Henry had a huge wedding, it was really nice but all she did for months is brag about how amazing her wedding was. The wedding stuff's died down now so recently she's started going on about how wealthy her husband is and what a great lifestyle they have. One of my other aunts celebrated her 50th about a week ago, I went with Chris and Kat was there with Henry. We were chatting and Kat was saying how Henry has a fantastic new job that pays even more than his previous one. Henry chimed in and said that they were already planning to buy a new house. Kat asked what Chris does. I said he was an engineer like Henry and he has a good job too, but I'll admit I left out where he works on purpose. She smiled and nodded, then said it's fine, she understands that I'm embarrassed and want to keep it quiet. So that was pretty much the end of our conversation then - when we were leaving, she pulled me aside and told me to ""let her and Henry know if we needed help with the wedding"". Obviously I knew what she meant and it was just another dig, but I said bye and left.

Literally two days later, I get a dm from Kat and she's furious (well, as much as one can be through text) that I didn't tell them that Chris was one of Henry's bosses. Henry was shocked to see him in the office and Chris made a comment ""tell Kat -OP- and me don't need help but thanks for offering"". Henry's really embarrassed and so's Kat, and she said that we made them look bad on purpose and if she knew, she'd have never made those comments. It was my ""duty"" to tell her and Henry. Chris and I had a really good laugh over this, but she sent a text out to the family group chat we have saying how she was ""blindsided"" by me. A few others said that what we did was petty and wrong. So, AITA?",27104,v6t4aq,"NTA

Kat is embarrassed and also annoyed she can’t brag and one up you so she’s telling you off as a way to clambour back power over you. Stand your ground and don’t apologise.

AITA for high fiving a stranger who “humiliated” my bf?,"My bf and I go to the climbing gym regularly. He is really into it and I just started and climbing a few times a week. He’s stupidly competitive about it and quietly insults beginners who are not as good which makes me feel self conscious because I’m a beginner. 

Last night we were at the climbing gym again and he was doing a V6. There was about 6 people taking turns on the problem probably because it’s a newly installed route and they were all failing. Then a girl came and flashed it. She made it so easy but at the end she didn’t hold the final hold for 5 seconds and my bf called her out after she was done. Holding the last hold for 5 seconds is suppose to be the “right way” of finishing a route but she was doing it so easily she definitely could have. I think he was just being salty because she did it when he couldn’t. She laughed and told him he didn’t even start the problem correctly and walked off. I gave her a high five because she was walking towards me and did amazing at the problem (and knocked my bf off his high horse) and she was surprised but high fived me. 

My bf turned to me and gave me a wtf look and wouldn’t talk to me the rest of the night. When we were heading home he ranted that I couldn’t be trusted to watch his back if I chose to take a stranger’s side over him.

AITA for not waking my husband up for his 5AM walk?,"
So for the past month, my (36) husband (39) has waking up at 5 every night to have a walk. These walks would take about 2 hours, Side note to mention that this new, he's not trying to lose weight (pretty thin) he's not athletic by nature nor has sports interests or hobbies. infact, he hated doing any type of sport.

I'm happy for him since it's an overall positive thing. but yesterday, he came home in the evening after working for long hours then stayed up late playing with his phone. I went to bed at 10 after getting done with the mess and everything.

I woke up by him yelling at me at 7 am asking me why I didn't wake him up for his 5am walk. He said he missed it and I'm responsible for that. I was so confused I said that first of all, he always wakes up by setting his alarm, why should I be expected to wake him up this time. He yelled that he forgot to set his alarm. I said so what? it's no big deal it's not like....he missed an important meaning or something but he got more angry and said that those walks help imrove his health and restore his energy and help him feel better. I made a comment about how missing one walk won't hurt but he unloaded on yelling about how I was trying to prevent him for doing his hobby for some unknown reason. I told him he was sorely mistaken even though I admit that those daily 5am walks around the veteran's park are weird but also his reaction? I really thought it was over the top. He stormed off and went to shower saying I ruined his entire day.

When he got out he started avoiding and ignoring me. Even when I talk to him directly. he went to work and refused to respond to my calls.

Really, I'm at a loss like maybe it was something I said about his walks. but I really don't know. he's sulking nonstop as of now and I'm literally about to lose my mind.

AITA For tricking my parents into being on time for my wedding.,"My (M33) parents are late for everything. Like everything. Both of my sister's and myself have been disappointed so many times.  

Graduation ceremonies, birthday parties, even my father's retirement dinner.  It is completely my mother's fault.  She is a wonderful mother and I love her dearly, she just does not understand the concept of punctuality.  

I have seen her talking to her sister on the phone and reminded her she needed to be at my baby sister's dance recital.  She waved me off and arrived after my sister had danced.  

We are all used to it.  My dad is just done trying to get her to be on time for anything. 

My now wife (F28) told me in no uncertain terms that if my mother was late for our wedding she would do terrible things to me.  She was only half joking.  But she was a witness to my mom and dad arriving halfway through my cousin's quinceañera.  

So here is what I did.  It is completely on me. Me wife was not involved. If there is a dick move it was completely mine. 

When we were getting samples for the wedding I talked to the printer and had one special invitation printed with the time on it stated s being one hour earlier than the actual start time of the ceremony.  

My mother was beside herself apparently when they left the house and thought they were going to miss the wedding since she was a part of it with her and my MIL lighting the candles we would use to light the unity candle and stuff.  

When she arrived and noticed other people were also just arriving and parking she was so relieved that we were starting late that she just went with it.  

The ceremony went off beautifully. And so did the wedding pictures and the reception. 

The problem came last Sunday. My parents came over for a big family dinner and we didn't bother starting the grill until they showed up.  She asked why everyone wasn't eating and we just said we knew we would be waiting for them since they are always late.  

She said that she was not always late and had been on time for my wedding.  She hadn't been. They arrived 45 minutes AFTER the time on their invitation.  

My idiot cousin John, real name because it's common and he deserves people to know he is a dolt, snorted at her statement.  A few other people giggled or smiled at this and she picked up and asked what was so funny.  

I came clean and told her about the ""special"" invitation.  

She is pissed at me for not trusting her and making her look foolish in front of everyone.  If my cousin had just controlled himself she never would have known.  

AITA,?

Edit

Part of the reason she is mad is because she had her invitation framed.  To be honest I was already planning a heist with my sisters to replace it with the real one in case she ever noticed the discrepancy between hers and the one we have framed in our home.

Edit number two. 

Yeah we are Latinos.  And no I do not in any way consider it racist how many of you guessed that.  I have been to Spain and it's an issue there too.  And the Philippines. Basically anywhere those guys were in charge.

Edit three.  

Stop defending John. He and I have spent thirty years messing with each other.  I have an AITA story that ends with me getting an offensive tattoo ($5,000 for removal) and him getting a body cavity search at the Mexican border.

AITA for being livid at my (now) husband?,"My (33F) husband (30M) and I got married last week.  I had been super chill throughout the whole wedding planning, and during the actual event.  Because I know sh\*t happens and if anything goes wrong, or not exactly how we wanted, it's not that big of a deal and may even make the wedding more memorable for the guests.  The one thing that I told my husband I didn't want to happen was I didn't want him smashing cake in my face.  I had a suspicion that he would find it funny to do it, so during the planning, I flat out told him not to do it.  I don't think it's funny, I don't want to mess up my makeup that took hours to apply, and I don't want cake on my expensive wedding dress.  I told him I would be livid if he did it.  He promised that he wouldn't.

Well, come the cake cutting time, what did he do?  Smashed the cake in my face!  It got on my dress, and messed up my makeup, just like I knew it would.  I'm pretty sure his friends convinced him to do it, not that that makes it any better.  I kept it together, went and cleaned myself up, and put on a smile for the rest of the reception.  But afterwards, I let loose on him.  I yelled at him that this was the ONE THING I asked him not to do, and he promised that he wouldn't.  He told me I was being dramatic, that it's not a big deal, and we should just be enjoying our time as newlyweds.  So was I being overly dramatic?  AITA?",26820,uwpjcd,"What worries me isn't that he did the cake smashing itself. 

It is his response back to you.

He should have apologized and listened to you, and really realized his mistake. Instead, he diminished your very valid feelings and reasons.

Has he apologized yet? For calling you over dramatic?

AITA for screenshotting messages guys sent me and sending them to their mothers?,"I'm an 18 year old girl who is in college atm. I've been getting bullied/harassed by three guys in my class who have taken to messaging me online with rather gross/harassing messages and nsfw pictures that i'm sure you can all fill in the gaps without me going into detail. I should have reported them or just blocked them but I had, had enough so I screenshot every message they'd sent me and found their mothers through their facebook pages and sent screenshots to them including an explanation of who I am and how their sons have been bothering me.

Their mothers were horrified and shocked by what I sent them explaining what was going on and all three are on my side. Some of my friends think this is genius and exactly what they deserved but some of my other friends think I took it too far and it was out of line to put that on their Mothers and also how I don't know what their home life is like. 

Am I the asshole for doing this? Should I have gone about it another way?

Edit due to questions/comments: When it was just standard bullying I reported them but they only got a warning, the messages/pictures started after that as if to prove I couldn't do anything. I figured reporting them again wouldn't work so did this.

"AITA for ""forcing"" my father to pay child support","My father is a dick. When he got my mother pregnant he wanted her to quit her job and just stay home to ""be a good little wife and mother.  He is very well off due to a trust fund and he doesn't really need to work.  My mother refused and divorced him. Because of a prenup she got very little and he moved back to Europe. His parents never knew about me and my mother had a good profession and I never really wanted for anything. My grandmother and grandfather, her mom and dad were awesome, and I got to spend my summers exploring the wilds of Western Canada with them. My father never paid the child support he should have. Like I said it did really matter. My mom makes good money and she gave me a great life as a child.  

So the point of this post.    I'm (F28) getting married.  I met the love of my life (M31) at university and we have been together for eight years.  He is a wonderful person and he really is my lobster. (Sorry, Friends reference). 
His family is from the same city as my father and they are a huge rambunctious bunch. Because of a lot of intermingled business and personal relationships my parental grandparents found out about my impending wedding and me I suppose. The have been in contact and want to come to Canada to meet me and my fiancee who I guess is a grandson of an acquaintance of theirs.  Small world. 

When they found out that my father had basically abandoned me to fend for myself in this world, this is honestly how they see it, they were pissed to say the least. It is very funny because we are decidedly upper middle class here.

So long story short they had their lawyer calculate the amount of child support my father should have paid with inyerest and the cost of my post secondary education. They then gave my this as a gift.  What I didn't know was that it came out of my father's yearly draw on his trust fund.  

He is furious because it is obviously a sizeable amount and it will very much affect his finances for at least the next two years.  He may need to ,GASP, get a job.  

He has been contacting me and telling me that his current wife and children will be negatively affected if I don't give him back this money.  

I don't really need it. And I guess I am entitled to it and I am getting a trust fund now as well.  

But I really want to pay off any debt my mother may have and make sure that when she retires she can do whatever suits her fancy. 

I'm not giving it back. 

AITA?

Edit: to answer some common questions. 

1. My half siblings will not really be affected. They have trust funds set up already and their tuitions and fees and stuff are covered. 

2. My grandparents family sets these up when ba kid is born.  One of the reasons my father is upset is because since he didn't bother to tell his parents about me they did not set this up.  They have since taken a good chunk of his trust fund and used it to set mine up. Realistically the principle being separated 28 years ago would have left him in the exact same position. 

3. My mom was working on getting her PhD so she could help kids with a certain condition.  That is what he wanted her to walk away from. 

4. My grandparents have sent me pictures of my family there. The coolest thing is that my grandfather looks like the granddad from The Parent Trap.

5. My mom never remarried. But she has had a special friend since I was five.  He is amazing and taught me to swear in Colombian Spanish.

Edit número dos.

I just had lunch with my mom. Apparently she has no debt. Like at all.  I guess she did literally write the book about the treatment for the kids she works with she does okay for herself.  I never really thought about it.  We decided that what would be best is to set up a scholarship for people who want to go into her field of study.  Since I am now a trustafarian I can afford to do this. I am however going to book her and her ""friend"" a trip for after my wedding. And I am going to go pay off my car.

Edit tres

My half brother has posted about this. He has a slightly different viewpoint than myself.  He is not in any way coming after myself or my mother.

AITA for making my boyfriend feel uncomfortable after he insisted on joining us on girls night in?,"

My boyfriend m/27 started asking to join me in my girls night in. Everytime I tried to say no he be like ""I have to join or you'll have to cancel"". It made me & the girls miserable having to sit there with him in the middle.

This past friday he insisted to join us again, I had enough I came up with an idea to get him to hate hanging out with us, made a plan and told the girls what we were going to do and they were down for ot.


The girls came and my boyfriend immediately sat with us and started ruining our conversations by steering them towards him/his work/his achievement. So here's what I did, I started bringing up gross/ embarrassing subjects and the girls were eating them up by talking about them in details. Subjects like sevx, periods (his most sensitive spot), cramp diarrhea, hairy legs, fart getting trapped in the valva and coming out the front. Squeezing shit out of our faces, cramp diarrhea, dirty underware, and again...cramp diarrhea.

We talked about this stuff in boring details, like...I could feel his discomfert without even looking at him. But God when I turned to see why he got quiet suddenly. he was getting red in the face, and had sweat all over his forehead, I bet he found himself unable to relate to thise subject thus couldn't take part in the conversation.


He got up from the couch ready to head out, I looked at him and asked where he was going and he was like ""I just ah...I just remembered that I have an important meeting with a guy in about 10 minutes and....ah...I have to go now"" he rushed out telling us to have fun. The girls and I started laughing hysterically.


he came home and berated me saying I made him feel uncomfortable/sick with the horrible subjects I kept bringing. I said ""what u talking about? This is the typical stuff girls talk about all the time"" but he insisted I made him upset and caused him to leave. He declined to speak to me and been quiet since then.


AITA?

**UPDATW** Y'all wow, just got home and left this post at 70ish comments, and here I am looking at hundreds of comments but only read a bunch, you guys...thank you so much for your feed back and enlightening advice. Just to add context: this is his apartment, he tells me who is and isn't allowed to come and I thought this was fine since it's his place (though I help with the bills, but he makes so much more as the head of security in his company so that's that) I just can't believe how dense and blind I been to his negative ways. He's still giving me the silent treatment and I've decided it's just a lot to take, and so I'm temporarily moving in with one of the girls and will now be definately reconsidering few things.

AITA for going to a different hotel during my vacation with my husband?,"It our first real vacation since 2020 and my first with just my husband and in over 10 years. 

Our daughter Annie (17) was left home alone. For some reason recently Annie can do no right in hubby’s eyes. Dress, music, chores. He has deemed her irresponsible. It farthest from the truth. She has a summer job and makes good grades. She’s in-fact kinda a hermit for her age. 

Unknown to me my husband set the hot water heater to refill only once a day while we are gone. Annie did some dishes and laundry. She took a shower and the water was cold. She was upset and thought it broke and called us panicking. 

My husband yelled into her for wasting our hot water and telling her how irresponsible she was enough to make her cry. 

I got madder than I ever have in this marriage and basically said most parents would love to have a 17 year old like Annie. We argued and screamed all night so next day I left the resort to a little hotel down the street.

AITA for calling the Police on my husband after I found that he was hiding my son's motorcycle?,"
I got my son a 7k motorcycle for his 18th birthday this past june. My son is obssessed with automobile and loves motorcycles. In his room he has plenty of models and posters of motorcylces of all types. His bio dad passed away when he was just 12, now I'm married to my current husband and he has kids of his own.


My husband has always been against my son's interest in motorcycles. he thinks I'm encouraging him to be reckless, distracting him from school and by extension his future, and spoiling him and blowing away money by spending 7k on a motorcycle. This caused some tension between him and my son so I told him to stop complaining about it.


Around 2 weeks ago, my son's motorcycle went missing. We opened a police report but nothing came out of it. it just disappeared. My husband had a smirk on his face the entire time just walking around saying ""I told you so!, you just wasted your money!"". This was unbbearablr to hear to be quite honest.


My mother inlaw visited few days ago. She was talking about the other house my husband owns and mentioned seeing a motorcycle, one that's similar to the one that we lost in my husband's carage while she was cleaning it (she goes to clean that house weekly even though it's empty, my husband plans on giving it to his kids as inheritance). I was puzzled I asked if she was certain but she showed me a photo she took of it which confirmed that it was indeed my son's motorcycle. I immedietly rushed to call my husband and confront him about it. He admitted that he took and hid the motorcycle in his garage as a last resort after me and his stepson kept brushing him and his thoughts off about the 7k being spent on something unnecesary and that could cause issues.

I blew up at him demanding he return it, he refused and told me he had been considering selling it and giving the money back to me so ""I could use it wisely this time"". I told him I was serious and that I'd call the police. He literally said ""this is a family matter and cops can't do shit about it"". I had enough I called the cops soon as I ended the call with him.


The motorcycle was found and returned, but my husband had to be taken in since there was an open file about the motorcylce going missing. he was let go eventually but he was livid with me. He came home yelling about how awful what I did was and how crazy my behavior was. I refused to engage in the argument but he told his entire family about it and they judged me for calling the police on my own husband even though I already asked him to return it. he said he was just looking out for my son and that one day we'll realize that he was right but only when it's too late.

AITA for making sexy poses while neighbor kept recording me for no reason?,"My dad passed away recently and he left me (26M) and my sister (31f) his house. It’s super unkempt so I’ve been doing lots of yard work outside in the mornings. I’m out there watering the grass in the mornings and evenings. Every single time I’ve done this the neighbor right next door who’s like this older granny comes out to her porch and straight up watches me without even hiding it. I introduced myself to her once that me and my sister are the new owners after my dad passed but it was obvious she didn’t wanna talk. 

Next thing she started coming outside with her *phone* pointing the camera right at me. I’m like “ is there a problem?” She says there’s no problem as long as I’m doing what I’m supposed to. I asked her why is she recording me then. Neighbor lady goes what’s the problem with me recording if you’re not doing anything wrong. It’s so fucking weird I didn’t even know how to respond to the situation. 

Soon as I finished up to go back inside she went back to her house too. This happens every. single. day I’m outside watering the grass. Always the same excuse that she wants to make sure I’m not doing anything else or if I do it’s on camera. So yesterday I got fed up and decided to do something different. When she came out with her phone I stuck my ass out and put my hand on my hip looking right at her. 

At first she was like wtf but then she got really mad when I started wetting myself with the water hose an touching my neck while literally looking directly at her. Was it stupid? 

Yes but she put her phone away and started cussing me out for being a pervert. My sister told me later on that she came to the house when I was at work talking about me sexually harassing her making poses in provocative ways. My sister knows she’s a pain in the ass since she probably has nothing better to do with her time. 

But I still shouldn’t have stooped to her level making her uncomfortable right back.

AITA for installing a lock on the bathroom door after my BIL kept barging in?,"
My f25 husband's m30, brother (BIL) m33 moved in with us after his divorce few weeks ago. The problem I have is that he started barging in to the bathroom whenever I'm using it. He never knocks or anything. Another thing is that he only does this when it's me in the bathroom not his brother. I told my husband about what I'd noticed but he laughed it off and called me paranoid. It was embarrassing because his brother would see me exposed and it made me uncomfortable. My husband said he spoke to him and he apologized but did it again.


When my husband and I got married, we promised to not have locks or lock each other out of any room. So the bathroom didn't have a lock. I was really considering getting a lock and I let my husband know that if his brother walks in on me in the bathroom one more time then a lock will instantly be installed. He didn't say anything.


Well, Yesterday, BIL walked in on me showering. He knew I would be in the shower but barged in anyone claming he needed to pee. I had enough I went out and got a lock and installed it. My husband got home, saw it and blew up on me saying I voilated an agreement that I was part of"" and went against his wishes being uncomfortable with locks in the house. He demanded I remove it and *promised* and *guarenteed* that his brother won't walk in on me again but I refused. 

He's been pissed about it since then and is giving the silence treatement.


INFO I'm not close with my BIL, my husband is. I don't even talk to him that much and I barely even sat with him at any gathering before he moved in with us.





UPATDATE: So before I provide an update on this situation. It's worth noting that my BIL used to do this with the bedroom too but at least I'm not always exposed in the bedroom.


So My husband came home and I told him the lock will not be removed til his brother leaves and his reaction was to try and remove the lock himself and tell me to quit acting childishy. what I did was not shout or scream but pack a bag and go to my mom's house for the next few days or so til this gets resolved somehow. On my way out I saw my BIL in the driveway smoking. He knew what the argument between me and my husband was about but instead of stepping up to fix it he offered to take me to my mom's house saying that my husband could use some space ""from me"". This made me cry the whole uber ride to my mom's house. The reason I feel offended is because BIL tend to be hurtful when he talks about others. I did all I could to win his approval but he thinks less of me and thinks I'm childish just like my husband says.",26398,xgktnb,"NTA, BIL is doing this on purpose and not respecting any boundaries.

AITA for ignoring an autistic guy on my flight?,"AITA for ignoring an Autistic guy on my flight?

I'm a 19F who was traveling alone on an 11 hour flight today, and a guy in his 20s(?) Is in the same row as me. I was exhausted because I only got four hours of sleep before the flight so I could sleep on the plane, but this guy (we'll call him C) keeps trying to make conversation. C starts off by telling me he's autistic, and then asking me if I like KPOP and he keeps non stop talking and rarely gives me a chance to speak, not that I wanted to. 
I tried to be polite because I have ADHD and I understand how social cues are difficult so he probably can't tell I'm not in the mood. Over the course of the next 20 minutes I tell C maybe 5 times I want to sleep and put my headphones on and each time C begins speaking to me after maybe 2 minutes of silence. Finally I was able to sleep for around 4 hours, but when I woke up C started up again. I'm still really tired, and I had some personal issues the day before my flight so I'm also socially exhausted, but I let him talk for a bit before I start watching a show on my phone.
 I tell him maybe 5 seperate times that I'm trying to watch a show, and that I'm not interested in talking to him right now but maybe later. C still keeps trying to talk to me, and when I snap a bit and tell him I'm getting a bit annoyed he goes into a full on self-hating "" i'm so sorry, i'm horrible god im just gonna shut up now"" rant, and I feel bad because I should have been nicer to him and I can understand emotions being too strong and spiraling. I tell C that it's okay, and I just want some time to myself as I'm not the chattiest person, but maybe later we can talk. I put my headphones on and watched my show, but C kept trying to speak to me but this time I ignored him, which was honestly a shitty move from me but I just didn't have the energy at this point to interact with him. This was the wrong move, as he moved to get out of the row and stood in the aisle and began yelling at me. I didn't catch everything he said but it was along the lines of "" Why can't women believe not all men are bad. Some men are on your side. I'm a nice guy, why are you ignoring me."" He storms off to the bathroom and I take that chance to ask a flight attendant if I can change my seat because he really freaked me out and I didn't want to have a panic attack on a plane. The flight attendants were amazing and got my stuff and moved me far away from him.
 
I feel like i'm TA because he does have autism and I could have been more patient maybe and ignoring him was a shit thing to do.",26379,uxfsmw,NTA.

AITA for telling my girlfriend I'll keep honoring my best friend's dying wish even if it makes her uncomfortable?,"My late best friend and I knew each other since we were little. We were next-door neighbors and always played together. We even went to the same kindergarten, primary school and middle/high school together.

One day during our sophomore year, we started talking about how most of our classmates had started dating. We obviously weren’t okay with that and decided get one up on all of them by getting married. As a joke I made her a fake ring and she gave me her scrunchie.

A few weeks later, a drunk driver hit her. She sustained multiple injuries and was in the ICU for 2 months, the doctor told her family that her survival chances are slim. In the only time I talked to her before she died, she made me promise to always visit her on our ""wedding anniversary"" and to wear her scrunchie during the visit.

4 years ago when I started dating my girlfriend I told her about it and asked if she was okay with it. She commented about how sweet and nice the tradition was and told me she was perfectly fine with it.

Today was the 10th anniversary and I took the day off, before my girlfriend went to work she told me it’s time to put this tradition to rest and move on because it was starting to get pathetic that I still wear a dead girl scrunchie to celebrate a fake marriage that we had 10 years ago.

I was furious at her comments because she wasn’t just a “dead girl”. She was my best friend and like a sister to me, we grew up and did everything together. I told my girlfriend a long time ago that we never had a sexual or romantic relationship and that our wedding was just a joke. It’s not like I talk about her or keep her photos around the house or anything similar. The only times I've talked about her to my girlfriend is when I told her if she was okay with the tradition or if she asked me about her.

I'm ASTONISHED by this sub's reaction. I'm getting weird vibes all over the place. 

I agree, it is possible OP has a shitty girlfriend who has to be first in everything and 'can't handle' the slightest emotional competition from a dead girl. 

You don't tell us ANYTHING about your relationship with your girlfriend. NOTHING. Is she... nice? Do you make time for her in your life? Do you live together? Do you like her? Do you give a single fuck about her? Is she a person? I'm not sure. The lack of detail about this woman is completely disturbing: she's anonymous, The Girlfriend, to the point of seeming like a Jungian archetype. 

But you've been with her for four years. There IS more context to be provided. WHERE is it?  WHY don't you feel any need to give it? It's so weird. So weird. Like, what's been going on with you guys lately? Have you, maybe, been fighting? Maybe because you don't communicate with her? Because she feels neglected, like you're emotionally closed off, like you don't express affection? Maybe because you don't make time for her, possibly don't give a shit about her, possibly are emotionally closed off, possibly has talked with you about this and this fight is the final straw? Are you a garbage boyfriend? No offense, just asking. 

**REDDIT: WTF. This is one snippet from a four-year relationship. To judge assholery, we need to understand this episode within the context of that relationship. With the** ***living*** **girl. The fact that OP doesn't give any is a huge red flag.**  

In your post you say: 

>I told my girlfriend a long time ago that we never had a sexual or romantic relationship and that our wedding was just a joke. **It’s not like I talk about her** or keep her photos around the house or anything similar. **The only times I've talked about her to my girlfriend** is when I told her if she was okay with the tradition or **if she asked me about her**. ""It's not like I talk about her or keep photos around the house."" 

""It's not like I ever actually talk to my girlfriend.""  You keep repeating this. But why are you saying this like it's a good thing? Why are you saying it like it's a defense? ""Duhh I literally never talk to my girlfriend about her, ever, so why doesn't she understand how important she was to me?""  ""I've completely closed off this part of my life to her, made it into this big weird secret between us, so why's that a problem in my relationship?"" 

Talk to your fucking girlfriend. Show her the pictures. Answer her questions. Share this part of your life with her. She's asking about it. Explain what this girl meant to you - not just by saying the words 'she was my best friend' or 'we were close' but by opening up and sharing your feelings and anecdotes and being emotionally vulnerable. Maybe, maybe, she won't be jealous at all. Maybe that's fundamentally not the issue, here. Maybe it's a narrative you've constructed for yourself to justify why not sharing this part of your life with your girlfriend is you being a good partner, not a bad partner, who is shutting her out. You're implying the only possible issue here is sexual or romantic or romantic jealous. But maybe all she needs is some communication. Maybe she would enjoy learning more about what your friend meant, and understand that this wasn't some random girl. You know, if you EXPLAIN it to her. 

I'm pissed off right now. I'm mad at Reddit. Dear AITA, YTA today. There's no reason to think that the girlfriend's issue is sexual or romantic jealousy except that HE implies it, as part of an internal justification for why never talking to his girlfriend is a virtue, not a vice. He implies that the only possible issue is her being jealous of a dead girl, and everyone is just so fucking ready it to believe it, even though there are more red flags in this post than I can count, no, the entire internet is just eating out of the palm of his hand. Fuck right off. All of you. You know why. I don't even have to say it.

AITA for blowing up on my fiancé infront of his family for getting my daughter's cat out of the house?,"I f35 got engaged to my fiancé Eric m37 2 months ago. He moved in with me and my daughter Zoey f13. Everything was going well til he started complaining about Zoey's cat which is strange because the cat is so sweet and quiet most of the time and so I had no idea what the issue was exactly.

Anyways, he went from complaining about the cat to making demands about her. He gave Zoey a list of places the cat can/can't go, things she's ""allowed"" to touch, banned her from places like kitchen and sofa (Zoey's favorite place to cuddle with her cat). Zoey showed me this list and I had an argument with him telling him he needed to stop this because it was ridiculous. He ranted about this being his house too and how he expects things to change after we get married.

Few days ago, I was at work and got a call from Zoey crying saying her cat wasn't in her room and in the house. I freaked out too and went home to look for her. Zoey and I looked for 2 hrs before a neighbor of ours brought her and told us that he saw Eric leaving her outside and getting in his car and leaving. I was surprised and quite angry. Zoey took her cat and went back inside. I immediately drove to my future inlaws home where Eric said he'd be. The second I saw him sitting with his family I went off and blew up at him infront of everyone. His mom asked what was happening and I told her her son got my daughter's INDOOR cat outside the house probably hoping for her to get lost. He argued about wanting me yo stop spouting nonesense and go home and we'd talk there but I refused. It got worse and I ended up leaving after his family flipped out at him.


He sent a bunch of texts talking about the stunt I pulled infront of his family. He said that he didn't mean to leave the cat out but after checking the cams I confirmed it. He still insisted that I humiliated him infront of his family and tried to turn them against him.

He's been staying with a friend and has stopped calling and texting.

AITA for laughing in my mother's friends face when she told me to 'go to my room'?,"I (25,F) don't speak to my mother, like at all. I had to go to my mother's house today to pick up an important document that I left behind when I moved out seven years ago.

As soon as I got to the house, my mother suddenly had a massive 'emergency' and realised that it was apparently her friend's funeral today and she completely forgot about it. I couldn't help but internally roll my eyes, as there is always some drama hence why I have gone no/very low contact. 

She asked me if I would watch my two younger brothers (7 and 11) whilst she went to the funeral, and I said absolutely not, as it's my only day off, I have plans, and I have no relationship with them due to my mother stopping them from seeing me for years. I just wanted to get my birth certificate and leave. 

My mother asked her friend if she would babysit and asked me to stay for 10 minutes until her friend came. I didn't even get the opportunity to say no before my mother left the house. I was seething but resolved to wait 10 minutes. My mother's friend turned up and started berating me for not agreeing to look after my brother's whilst my mother went to the funeral. 

I said 'I don't have anything to do with my mother, it's my day off work, and I'm under no obligation to look after anyone else's children'. My mother's friend then told me to 'go to my room'. I laughed in her face and started to leave the house, and she asked me where I was going. And I told her, 'my room, at my apartment, that I pay for with my big girl job. Because I'm an adult, not a child. And don't ever speak down to me like that again'. And I left. 

My mother has left me loads of messages and missed calls saying I'm an AH for the way I spoke to her friend. I do admit I look kinda young but I still am not happy with the way my mother's friend spoke to me.

AITA for taking my daughter to get her hair cut when I knew it would upset my wife?,"Me (29M) and my wife (30F) have a little girl (8F) who I'll be calling Anna.

Now, Anna has very thick, blonde and curly hair that my wife adores. Ever since she was a toddler, she'd spend hours doing her hair every day, braiding it, straightening it and styling it in all sorts of ways. Our bathroom cabinets are always filled to the brim with a bunch of hair lotions, oils, creams and other fancy products I don't even know the names of. So I think it's more than fair to say that my wife's a bit obsessed with the whole hair thing. Anna, however, has never been too fond of getting her hair done, or of anything that involves having to sit still for more than a few minutes.

Before she got it cut, her hair used to reach past her waist. And while it looked lovely, she hated getting it brushed and every morning used to be a screaming fest between her and my wife. Lately, she'd been begging for a shorter haircut. My wife ignored her whenever the topic was brought up in hopes that she'd forget about it, but none of that ended up happening. 

I think Anna realized she was getting nowhere with her mom, because she started asking me to take her instead. I was reluctant to at first because I didn't know how my wife would react, but I agreed when I saw just how excited the kid was over something as simple as a haircut.

So yesterday I drove her to the hairdresser, where she got to flip through a lot of magazines and pick a picture of a haircut. And when she chose a really short clipper cut, I knew I was gonna be in deep shit with my wife. At that point though, there was no turning back. I mean, what could I have really done? Told her that no, she can't get the haircut she was so over the moon about, all because her mom wouldn't like it? I couldn't do that.

So we went ahead with the haircut, and by the end of it Anna couldn't stop smiling. She went around the salon showing it off to everyone and even asked me to take a bunch of pictures even though she normally hates having pictures taken of her. We did get one rude comment from an older woman at the salon, something along the lines of 'You can't even tell if she's a boy or a girl now', but Anna was way too excited about her hair to notice, and if she did notice she didn't care.

When my wife got home from work that day though, things quickly took a turn for the worse. She refused to even look at Anna, locked herself in her room and cried then got in the car and drove off. It's been a day now and she's still not back, it's honestly starting to worry me. I knew she wouldn't react well to the haircut but I wasn't expecting her to take it this badly. The kid's upset too and no matter how much I reassure her she still thinks she's in trouble for getting her hair cut. 

AITA? I realize how attached my wife was to Anna's hair, but at the end of the day I still think it's just hair. The kid's old enough to decide these things for herself and she was really happy with the haircut, so I don't think I did something wrong here.",26194,uarm30,NTA.

AITA for not paying for my daughter's wedding because she invited my brother and his family,"I'm 46M, my brother 48M.

When I was 20, my then girlfriend cheated with my brother. I was heartbroken and pissed. I told him he is no longer my brother. Despite my request, my family didnt cut him off, so I told them that I will never again be in the same place as he is. If they wish to invite both, then they should just invite him as I am the one giving ultimate.

My daughter is getting married in spring next year. In our culture both parents are paying for the wedding, 50/50. Unexpectedly, my daughter sat me down and told me that she will be inviting my brother and his family(he married my cheating ex). Apparently, she was seeing them for the last 4 years and built a relationship behind my back. She even wants her cousin to be some kind of flower girl.

I was pissed. I told her what my boundaries are and if my brother is invited then I will not pay my part of the wedding. She became angry and told me its time to let go of the past. I told her its not her call to make. We argued some more and she told me I am making her wedding about myself. I told her I will probably not even attend so it will be all about her. She left crying.

My ex-wife called me screaming and told me I'm huge AH and our daughter is crushed. Then my parents called, same thing. I told them off and now I'm ignoring their calls. My GF told me to reconsider and appologize. That by not paying and attending I will break relationship with my daughter. I don't know. I think my boundaries should be respected. Am I asshole for that?",26181,y9591p,"Look you are NTA the asshole for feeling what you are feeling and wanting nothing to do with your brother. You had a right to set your boundaries with your brother, but your daughter is not bound by those boundaries. 

And I just have to say Reddit is nuts - most people on here must be living some privileged life if the worst thing that has happened to them is someone cheating on them. 

Cutting your brother off when this happened was healthy, but asking your parents to cut their relationship was nuts. Your brother and that woman have been together or 20 years (?) now... It's insane to hold on to this anger and Nuke the relationships around you. 

Why did your daughter want a relationship with her uncle? Is their daughter her only cousin/sibling? Do you have a problem with the daughter coming or just your brother and wife? There is a lot of missing information here. 

In the end, with the info given, I think you have the right to make whatever decision you want and technically I would go as far as saying  you are in the right here morally - but you are going to end up alone - and will it be worth it to be right and alone in your specific case ... I guess you get to decide that. (I personally would have let this go and moved on - I wouldn't have a relationship with my brother but I would be civil on the few events I may have to him for my loved ones sake)

I have seen a lot of parents on here regretting their decisions with their child even when they were morally correct in the decisions they made. I would hate to see you in that same spot ... sometimes some things are more important than being right. I would decide if being right is worth loosing your daughter.",88,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/y9591p/aita_for_not_paying_for_my_daughters_wedding/
AITA for changing the door locks back after my wife changed them?,"I <30M> have a beautiful wife who loves to serve others. We bought a home down the street from my family. I have a sweet sister <17>
Who likes to crash at our house with her friends. 

My wife normally is pretty easy going until recently. My sisters friends have been leaving messes. Mostly towels on the floor after using our pool. My wife got upset picking up after them every day.  I have asked my sister to make sure the house is clean after they leave and it has been better. My wife also complained that some of her perfumes/Clothes personal items have gone missing.
My sister said it’s not her. I believe my sister. I just don’t see her doing that. I told my wife and we agreed to just replace them.

Last week my wife made a couple of pans of cinnamon rolls from scratch. One pan was for us, the second pan was for a co-workers family who is experiencing a tragedy. 

My wife went to the gym. I went to work and my sister and her friends came by. The one pan wasn’t enough for her and her friends.
They wanted the second pan of cinnamon rolls and my sister texted my wife asking if they could eat them. My wife said no.

They ate them anyways. My wife upset went and bought new locks. When I came home my wife handed me a new key and told me that she didn’t want anyone else to have a key to our house.

I tried to calm her down and tell her that I would just go replace the eaten cinnamon rolls with store bought ones. My wife decided this was her hill to die on and said no my sister lost the privilege to come when we are not home. Replacing stolen items wasn’t “good enough” anymore.

My mom called and asked if my sister could use the pool as a back to school party? I was under the impression my mom would be there. I said yes, my mom was at work and our schedules clashed. The easiest solution was for me To change the locks back so they could come into the house.

My mom didn’t come with my sister. When my wife got home after the party. It was a mess. She sent me photos. She called me the A for changing the locks without talking to her about it. (Keep in mind she did too.) then told me I broke her trust. She wasn’t safe in her home because she keeps getting robbed and I refuse to put an end to it. (I did talk to my sister). Then my wife let me know she was staying with a friend for awhile. 

Am I the A here? I feel like I have tried to right any wrongs that have happened. 
Between my wife and my sister.

Update* sorry I haven’t been able to reply the past couple of hours. I have been busy.

I talked to my mom again and let her know my sister isn’t allowed over without me home. 

I asked a friends wife who is a maid to come deep clean our home. So if/when my wife comes home it’s clean.

The last thing is my mom asked me to help cover my sisters cheer. She is on track for a scholarship. I told my mom I would pay half of my wife’s things were returned. If not the money was going to replace the stolen items.

Also my sister was invited to home coming. She wanted me to buy a dress. I told her no for not following our home rules and the money I saved for the dress is going to pay for the maid.

I did replace the locks again. I also am planning a romantic dinner I will make and clean up. I heard a lot about the cinnamon rolls. Someone on here gave me the idea to make them. I am for a dessert.

Update: my sister and my mom left a few mins ago. My sister had a bag of my wife’s things. More than I thought was gone. Most items are in poor shape.

The big thing is she had my wife’s grandmothers ring I thought was in the safe. I had no idea it was gone. My sister said that she found it on my wife’s night stand during the party. She forgot she had it on when she left our home. The ring isn’t valuable it’s just sentimental. I told my mom who the ring belonged to. My mom lost it. My sister is now grounded.

Last update tonight, my wife is coming home. I am staying at a friends house. Until we can work some of this out. 
I already stated it but I did put the locks back on my wife bought. My family doesn’t have that key.

Early morning update, My mom called my wife last night and asked what my sister can do to fix/ replace the damaged items.
My wife said “have her meet me every morning at 5 am.” I decided to tag along and see what my wife had planned. Trying to support her in whatever punishment she decides to do. You know the cinnamon rolls. My wife’s co-works 4 yr old is in the final stages of cancer. My wife’s plan is for my sister and her to prepare breakfast, get their other kids up and ready for the day. Start laundry, basic clean up. So her co-worker and his wife can spend as much time as he can with the sick child before work.

My sister was silent the whole time coming back home.
I can tell it really hit her that her life isn’t as hard. Even being grounded.

Last and final post, my wife has given me a second chance as long as I follow her list of rules.
1) for awhile no family at our home
2) no family borrowing our things. 
3)no one is allowed a key
4)I help with the chores around the house. Including cooking meals.
5) last My wife is ok with me seeing my sister but asked that we all go to counseling to understand why my sister is targeting her. 
My wife said all of this has been really hard and she doesn’t want to cause more issues but she just doesn’t trust my sister and can’t have her using out things.",26116,x0sib1,[removed],6739,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x0sib1/aita_for_changing_the_door_locks_back_after_my/
AITA for refusing to pay for girl’s wig after she shaved it because of me?,"There’s this girl that lives in my uni halls, we’re not roommates but we are flatmates. Let’s name her Kaya (F, 19). I (F, 19) met her in September when we started university and moved into halls. We’re not best friends but we are friendly. We don’t really spend much time together.  


Over time, my friends noticed that Kaya tried to copy me in everything. It started slowly, accessories and some clothes. Nothing major. I didn’t even notice until people started pointing it out to me. I have a rather distinct style and she started copying it. I don’t owe the style and she’s free to wear what she likes but it’s the exact same copies of my outfits which is very odd.


But then, it started going further. I dyed my hair, she dyed her hair, I bought something for my room, she bought the same thing. I started chatting with a guy, she became obsessed with that guy to a point that whenever I had a male friend or guy I was interested in over, she would go out of her way to try and get their attention, coming down to the kitchen in nothing but a towel (she never used to do it), etc. And she would do anything to attract attention. Now, don’t get me wrong, I couldn’t care less if the guy was looking and even if it was my boyfriend looking, I’d have a beef with him not her  but the blatant attention seeking behaviour was just odd. 
I joined societies and sports and after she found out, she joined the same ones I did. 
Basically, everything I do, she copies eventually. It’s just really creepy but I haven’t said anything, I wouldn’t even know what to say.

Over the Easter break, my friend and I were at my family house, a bit drunk and decided to test out whether Kaya really copies everything I do. I made a post on social media about shaving my head. My friend does hairdressing and she helped me out faking shaved head and I posted a photo with shaved head.

I deleted the photo few days later and forgot about this whole thing. After easter break was over, we had uni exams and I was focusing on that. Imagine my shock when I came back and Kaya had shaved head. And she was pissed when she saw me. She started shouting how I lied to her and why would I do that. She went on and on and on, really angry. Admittedly, I ignored her and hid in my room. She sent me a text telling me that she expects me to pay for her wig as it’s my fault she shaved her head. I replied that absolutely not, that it was not my fault and she decided on her own to do that.
She kept attacking me over it every time I saw her (it’s been a few days since I came back from easter break). My exams start tomorrow and yesterday I received an e-mail from my university, asking me for a meeting over the issue. She REPORTED me to uni over something she’s done. I am genuinely confused, was I really in the wrong. AITA for pretending to shave my head and refusing to pay for her wig?",26103,ukzctc,"NTA

This meeting with the university is a good thing. Before you go in, sit down and write out every time she has made you uncomfortable, every aspect of copying that you’ve noticed. Try to get evidence, like receipts of purchases you’ve made that she went on to buy. The date of your hairdressing appointment where you dyed your hair, which will predate hers. The dates of you joining societies, you first, and then her. See if any of your classmates are also willing to speak that they have noticed her unhealthy obsession - perhaps the men she’s become obsessed with after noticing you talking to them?

Then make sure the meeting does not include her. You need to feel comfortable to speak openly without her in the room, as she will not react well. When you walk in, immediately thank them for calling for a meeting to address her harassment of you. Take control and lay out everything that’s happened. Explain that you are becoming increasingly concerned for your safety, to the extent you are hiding in your room. It’s affecting your ability to study. She clearly has issues that she needs professional assistance with. If they ask why you haven’t confronted her, reply that you didn’t feel safe because her behaviour is becoming more and more unhinged.

Also, really highlight that you and your friend posted a photograph to your personal social media while you were at home on Easter break. You were off university grounds, during a university break, using non-university websites. It is entirely out of their purview. You also didn’t send this directly to Kaya, or make any suggestion to her that she do the same. Kaya accessed your social media, made assumptions, and continued her attempt to imitate you. You are NOT responsible for her actions, and her reaction to the realisation she no longer resembled you is alarming.

Then ask them how they are going to protect you from someone whose behaviour is now bordering on stalking. Ask if they are willing to support you in talking to the police about a potential restraining order. And then actually call the police. Whether or not they are able to do anything yet, you need this on record, and they will have information on how to protect yourself.

This may sounds extreme, but I assure you, it’s not. Kaya is becoming dangerous. She has moved beyond copying to anger. The next step in that escalation is to destroy the object of her attention. That’s why she has reported you. She wants you to be punished. When this doesn’t get the desired results, her frustration will make her angrier. She will eventually get violent if this isn’t nipped in the bud. She may try to cut your hair so that you and she look alike again.

September was only eight months ago. This isn’t a long period of time and look how invested she is already. Please take this seriously. Don’t let embarrassment or a desire to keep the peace prevent you from protecting yourself. Kaya has taken advantage of your good nature so far, and is now trying to mess with your education. Lay down your boundaries in steel. She is not to ever contact you again. You aren’t to have classes together or share living space. Please take care OP. It’s better to prevent it getting worse rather than wait until it actually is worse.",2091,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ukzctc/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_girls_wig_after_she/
AITA for taking off my leg and making someone look dumb and feel uncomfortable?,"I (21F) was in a very bad car accident about three years ago. A drunk drive ran a stop light, cut off a semi-truck, which then crashed into me, sending me crashing into two different cars and then ultimately into an embankment. My car was mangled and my leg was crushed, completely destroyed, and it had to be amputated. I also lost a couple fingers (the tip of one and all of another). I'm also left with some gnarly scars that used to bother me but I'm learning to deal with them. I got a couple different insurance payouts and some pain and suffering money in addition to my medical bills being paid and with my money I purchased a custom-made leg to take the place of the one I lost. When I have pants and shoes on you can hardly tell unless you're really looking. I still limp but some days I don't have as pronounced a limp.

Earlier today I went to the store with my boyfriend, my sister, her girlfriend, and our mother. I drove. I had to learn to drive with my left foot but I'm really good at it now. I also bought a new car with my money and had to go through a ton of therapy to get past my PTSD but I'm doing well there now as well. So, I drove us, and because of my injuries (in addition to my leg I also have chronic hip, neck, and back pain, and some issues with my lungs from the time spent intubated in a medically-induced coma that led to pneumonia) I have a handicap placard for my car. I have trouble walking without getting tired so it really helps to park close to the door. Today I did so and unknowingly took the space from someone who was circling back around for it. Apparently the man had been looking for a close space and had missed the one I took and went down and around. He was still on the other aisle when I pulled in so I didn't cut him off or anything and had no way of knowing he wanted the spot.

He parked in the yellow stripe zone and got out and immediately began confronting me about stealing a space from people who actually need it, how I'm just some kid who has no respect for those who are truly sick and suffering. He then ordered me to move. My group was urging me to just walk way but this has happened before and once the police were even called. I'm sick of people thinking that just because I'm young that I don't have a legit need for a little extra consideration. I said ""Okay"", and went to the car and got in like I was going to drive off. I was wearing a skirt and leggings so it wasn't quite obvious at first but when I sat down I took my leg off and showed it to the man, including my stump. I then asked him if it was okay if I still parked there. He walked away calling me disgusting and rude and said I could have just told him and I made him look stupid.

My group was embarrassed and said that I made things awkward because there was a crowd. AITA?

Edit: in case anyone was interested: I'm not going to post a photo of my leg because of identification reasons but I'll describe it. So the base color is ombre whiteish green to pale green and it has cherry blossoms painted on it, though sometimes I wear a silicone cover that resembles an actual foot and leg on days when I don't want people to stare at me. I even have temporary stickies I can put on the ""toes"" to make it look like I painted my nails. It's actually really cool!",26065,t65zud,"NTA

AITA for refusing to let my future husband lie about the house he and I purchased during his 'groom speech'?,"
My fiancè (37M) and I (33F) got engaged few months ago. We're getting married soon and invitations were already sent out. right now we're focusing on much smaller details. We've also been busy moving into our new home that we purchased together (30% of his savings + 70% of mine). I have to say that saving up for this house took most of my savings and prevented me from enjoying the things I love spending money on.


My fiancè sat me down yesterday to talk about his 'groom speech'. he talked about few points but what made me upset was when he asked if I would be okay if he mentions the house we bought and say that HE was the one who bought it. I was a bit taken aback, I asked why and he said it's ""just a confidence boost"" during the speech and that's it. I said I didn't feel comfortable with the idea because I think that it's unfair not to acknowledge the fact that I'd sacrificed so much to be able to buy the house. I reminded him of how much I contributed but he said this doesn't change that it's our house so it shouldn't matter to me if he said he bought it himself or we both did. I refused because then people will always think the house was bought by him which is something that will never change no matter how hard I try to prove that I contributed 70%. He got made at me and said that I was really overthinking this whole thing and making a big deal out of it. We got into an argument and he started yelling saying it's just one favor he's asking me to do and yet, I'm making this ridiculous, small request my hill to die on.

He's basically sulking and now he's out and refusing to answer my calls so basically he's started the silent treatment til I cave in. AITA for making this my hill to die on?

[EDIT] My fiance comes from more humble background and money has always been a struggle for him and his family. It's become obvious how insecure he can be when it comes to money, especially when he compares how much I make VS how he makes. I've never made him feel as less than and he has never took advantage of me in any way and so his recent request really cut me off guard to say the least.",26053,vdjwom,NTA and I would bet he's been telling people that already,38839,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vdjwom/aita_for_refusing_to_let_my_future_husband_lie/

He says Mexico is too dangerous, even though I’ve been there many times and even lived there for a year, speak Spanish, have friends there, and know my way around. No matter what I say, he doesn’t want me to go. 

Then a couple of days ago my passport went missing from my nightstand. I’m supposed to go tomorrow, so I wouldn’t have time to get a new one. I looked everywhere, no luck. When I asked Jake about it, he behaved a little suspiciously, but I dismissed it because I couldn’t believe he would actually take my passport to keep me from going. 

But he’s been giving me some red flags, so I decided to have a thorough look around. When he went out this morning, I started going through everything. As I searched, I became increasingly certain that he took my passport. I started off carefully picking through drawers and cabinets, but as my anger grew, I became a lot less careful. I started turning out drawers, pried open a brief case, made a total mess. But I found it. It was behind some books on the bookcase in his study. I never go into his study. He definitely put it there. 

Now he’s furious with me for going through his things and ransacking his place. He said he would have given my passport back, and there was no need for me to “go crazy.”I’m just angry that he took it to begin with, and I don’t believe him when he says he was going to give it back. 

This is only my third serious relationship, and I have no perspective on this kind of thing. AITA for “overreacting” and ransacking my (ex)boyfriend’s place?

Edit: thanks for the replies. I guess I was still in a weird state of disbelief that he did that and it made me question everything. Now that I’ve stopped shaking and have had the time to think, talk to my mom, and to read through these replies, I feel kinda silly for even wondering if I did something wrong. Suffice it to say it’s over for good, I’ve blocked him on everything and my dad and brother are over there getting what’s left of my stuff. I’m going to try to put it out of my mind and focus on my awesome trip.",26002,u0srja,"NTA his behaviour is controlling and unacceptable.

AITA for refusing to cook dinner for my step mother and her guests after she's been refusing to let me eat the food she cooks?,"16M here. My dad married my step mom just about a year ago. She didn't want me to live here and wants me gone. I've insisted that I should stay as I don't want to live with my mom (her husband is a piece of work...) so we're always clashing.

She announced last month that she wouldn't allow me to eat anything she cooks, or cook anything that she buys and I should arange my own food completely separately (down to the ingredient level, including salt!) because I'm not her problem to deal with. This is annoying but anyway, I can handle it and I didn't want to act entitled so I started buying and cooking my own food. We've been going like this since then.

Her sister had an accident a few days ago and on the day of the accident step mother texted me in the afternoon saying she's bringing the sister's children over and they'll arrive around midnight, asked me to buy groceries and snacks and make a late dinner for them. I never replied to her and didn't do anything. I have to say that while for a few hours it didn't look good for her sister and had to go into surgery it ended up being successful and she will thankfully make a full recovery.

They came, she noticed there's no food and they indeed were hungry so she was angry at me and I told her that it's not my problem to deal with... and she said I'm being a jerk and I said takes one to know one. She ended up ordering Pizza.

My dad told me that I was out of line and I should have just done what she wanted me to do because it was an emergency, and I should have done a favor for her and it would have gone a long way to improve our relationshiop. I told him that our relationship has always been hopeless because she hated me for no reason so there's nothing I can do that can make her hate me any less and at this point I've accepted it and don't care anymore. He said it's not true and I'm now grounded.",25989,vzq3nf,"NTA. You are NOT entitled.

AITA For telling my pregnant daughter that my husband and I will have nothing to do with raising her baby in front of the entire family?,"Hello, I am a fifty-six-year-old mother to thirty-three-year-old Kelly and grandmother to sixteen-year-old Opal. Kelly became pregnant with Opal at sixteen. My husband, Eddy, and I have always believed in having the right to choose. However, Kelly insisted that she wanted to keep the baby and not give it up for adoption.

We helped a lot as Kelly was only seventeen when Opal was born. However, Kelly would rarely help with parenting even when she was available. Even asking her to watch Opal for an hour while we ran errands was an issue. It was rare that Kelly wouldn’t complain about why she “had to be there"" to look after Opal.

Kelly chose not to attend college after graduation. She had a job with a flexible schedule, yet she rarely made herself available for Opal. Kelly was only home to sleep or get dressed for some party. She also relied on us to purchase supplies and book appointments for Opal. Eddy and I would have serious talks with Kelly that she needed to step up as a parent. Kelly would only make empty promises and never follow through on them.

Kelly moved out when Opal was six. Kelly comes around maybe once a fortnight and for holidays, but Eddy and I have been the ones to raise Opal. Opal is doing extremely well. She has good friends, plays Tennis, participates in volunteer projects, and plans to be a marine biologist after graduation.

The school year ended for Opal last week, so we had a nice dinner to celebrate her good grades. Kelly came, along with several other family members. We were all chatting and enjoying dinner together when Kelly stood up to make an announcement. She announced to us that she was pregnant with her boyfriend’s child.

We already were upset because this was supposed to be Opal’s special moment and Kelly announcing her pregnancy was completely inappropriate. Eddy and I said nothing, and Kelly started to say how she and her boyfriend were “so busy!” with life right now.

Eddy and I interrupted Kelly and told her we would have nothing to do with raising this new baby and would not be providing anything for it (supplies, childcare, etc.) Kelly flipped out and an argument ensued.

Kelly called us heartless and claimed we were willing to throw our grandchild away. Eddy and I called her selfish for expecting us to raise another child. We are too old to raise a baby. Kelly is thirty-three and needs to grow up. Give the baby up for adoption or be a parent and raise it yourself.

Kelly left in tears. Now the family has broken into “sides.” The ones agreeing with Kelly say that we adopted Opal and are sending a message that we don’t care about our newest grandchild. Others are saying we should have taken her aside privately instead of shooting her down in front of everyone and our reaction was cruel. Eddy and I feel we had to be blunt with Kelly and not sugarcoat reality.

Opal likes to show us stories from here sometimes, so I thought it would be a good place to ask for a neutral perspective. AITA?

Edit: Opal is always able to express her feelings with me or Eddy. Opal also has a therapist who is available to speak whenever she needs it. Opal visited the therapist weekly during middle school but now hasn't needed to see him more than once a month. We will be taking Opal on a mall trip to make up for what happened at the celebration dinner.

We spoke privately to Opal after this incident and she knows we in no way view her as a burden. Our granddaughter is a blessing and many of our happiest moments involved supporting Opal and watching her grow up. But Opal is sixteen: She doesn't need the kind of constant attention and care that a newborn baby does. We are now too old to be able to adequately raise a newborn baby even if we wanted to.

The biggest problem is that Kelly is now an adult and needs to start acting like one. Kelly is supposed to outlive us. The reality is that Eddy and I aren't going to be alive for her or her children's entire lives. It is why Kelly needs to accept that she cannot expect us to take on her responsibilities and must be independent.

Edit #2: Several people have informed me that the part where Kelly expected us to raise the new baby was unclear, so I apologize for that. I thought it was self-explanatory, but realize none of you actually experienced what happened.

Kelly talked about how busy she and her boyfriend were with their lives, then began to talk about how ""grateful"" she was that we ""would always look after our grandchildren"" and how since we had ""gained so much joy from raising Opal, we would be even happier raising this second baby!""

After Eddy and I called her out, Kelly confirmed that she had expected us to adopt and raise this second baby as well. Kelly said how she and her boyfriend did not have time to raise a baby but that putting up the baby for adoption would be ""throwing it away."" She assumed we, at almost sixty years old, would have no troubles or opposition to raising a newborn baby.",25953,v9gppu,"Your daughter has already completely disregarded Opal. Making her ""good news I have a real baby now!"" announcement at an end of school year party for Opal is some more grade A trash behavior. It's not a graduation party, is it? Because that would make it even worse behavior on Kelly's part. You may not have let them know in the most civil way possible, but I'm gonna say NTA because of how thoroughly Kelly has made it clear her daughter doesn't matter. You may have eventually raised her enough to call it ""adoption,"" but that was never the original intent, so Kelly can suck it.

Edited to add: **I completely missed that this was them asking you to raise the next one.** Holy fucking shit. Utter garbage, these people. I'm glad you said something right there. Firmly, loudly, rudely. They needed to hear it. Really, I would've supported being far more rude than you were. I'm glad Opal is in therapy and I'm glad she knows you don't see her as a burden.

AITA for telling my husband he should be ashamed of himself and he would be incredibly lucky if his oldest daughter ever speaks to him again?,"I married my husband 3 years ago. He was divorced, and previously widowered. He has two daughters. Annie who is now 26 (I believe) from his first marriage and Amy who is 17 from his second. My husband told me about his late wife, his ex wife, the issues he had as a blended family when he remarried and Annie was not on board with him remarrying and the fact this strain ended his second marriage. He was also honest that Annie never forgave him for remarrying and never wanted anything to do with Amy or him after she turned 18.

What he did not tell me was the MAJOR role he played in all of this. I found this out three weeks ago, at a dinner with his extended family.

The story as I now know it. When Amy was around 5 years old she took a special interest in a necklace that belonged to his late wife. My husband gave the necklace to Amy, which upset Annie, because all her mothers possessions were meant to go to her. My husband told Annie that it was just one item and she needed to get over it because Amy was entitled to have something too. Annie had brought up that it was the piece her mother wore the most. My husband told her that it was a special gift to give to her sister. That she was being selfish. His ex wife told her that her mother would want ""someone as special as your sister"" to have a piece of her as well. Annie never got over it. She tried to take it from Amy and was punished. The last time she saw any of them she told them all to go to fucking hell.

Amy still has the necklace too. She has let it get into a bad way, and talks about it as if her dad bought it for her.

I was shocked. I never would have expected my husband to be that way. He was very unapologetic about it and told me Annie would have to get over it some day. I told him he should be ashamed of himself. That he should have allowed Annie's mothers possessions to be hers, to do with as SHE chose, that Amy did not give a crap about his late wife or the significance of those items, but Annie would have. I told him he will be incredibly lucky if his daughter ever speaks to him again and I would not blame her if she never did.

He was furious I judged him. His family said I should take my husbands side over his daughter who I don't even know (except for the nephew and niece who told the whole story, because they also think my husband did a fucked up thing).

AITA for searching my husband's pants without asking him first?,"

Context: my husband [33] used to be unemployed for a year, he recently started a job at a warehouse. 

Yesterday, and while I was about to do the laundry, I grabbed his work pants and digged my hand in it's pockets to empty them before putting it in the washing machine like I  always do. 

My husband just happened to walk by and when he saw me searching his pants pockets. He rushed in yelling at me to put his pants down. I already had a folded piece of paper out but he snatched it then started screaming at me about how I have no respect for his privacy and that I shouldn't be getting my hands on his things. I was genuinly dumbfounded I told him to take it easy I alwaye do this before laundry. He lashed out saying I had no right and should've come to him and asked him first because he was worried about important documents getting lost like the one I pulled out. I said important documents shouldn't be inside his pockets and asked to see the paper but he said he won't show me. I asked why and he said I don't get to ask him jack shit after I disrespected his privacy. I almost laughed because what privacy does he have in pockets? It wasn't like a stranger was digging into them. 

He refused to speak to me and later brought a new closet with A LOCK and moved his clothes inside of it. I asked if he was serious and he said this will teach me to respect his privacy and deter my snooping. Then went back to not speaking to me.

AITA for putting parental controls on my TV and royally pissing off my FIL?,"I (M30's) live with my wife (F30's). We have two kids, M8 and F6.

My wife's parents are staying with us temporarily as their home is having some serious repairs after a freak accident. It wasn't their fault and luckily they had insurance. The repairs should be completed in two months from now.

I don't really get along with my in-laws, especially my father-in-law, but I agreed to let them stay because I thought the time would fly by and it wouldn't be that bad, but I'm posting here so I guess I was wrong.

My MIL doesn't have a job and my FIL works late shifts until around 11pm. When he gets home they will watch YouTube in the living room and play music on it at a loud volume with our speaker system, it's not ""college house party bass tearing apart the walls"" loud but it is still loud.

My kids are not light sleepers but this wakes them up, then they go wake me up because they want me to make it stop. My kids need to be rested for school and I need to get up in the morning to drop them off and go to work.

My wife works overnight shifts so she doesn't witness this.

I've tried to talk to my MIL and FIL about it and asked that they please keep the noise down after my kids' bed time which is 8:30pm. I don't expect complete silence but I really don't think they need to have the TV on loud late at night.

My FIL argued with me and said that he doesn't finish work til 11pm, so I'm basically expecting him to not do the things he enjoys after work. I told him he can do it before work or on his days off or it's tough shit.

He complained to my wife who's now taking his side and saying that the kids need to learn how to sleep through ""a bit of everyday noise"".

I told her it's not everyday noise and that he and MIL are being excessively noisy and inconsiderate, she's just not there to see it. My FIL has been sending me links to buy earplugs for the kids.

I've gotten really fed up with this. It's not my in-laws' house and they're staying with us as guests and I think they're being really selfish.

I decided to put parental controls on the TV so that my in-laws can't use it after 8:30pm, until 6am the next day. Between those times the TV can't be used without putting in the password and only I know it. This doesn't affect my wife as she doesn't get off work until 6am and isn't normally home until 6:20ish.

My FIL is now incredibly pissed off with me and said that I'm acting like a child and keeps pestering me, demanding the password. My wife is also mad at me for upsetting her dad. 

I'm just so annoyed at this whole situation and I'm sick of hearing about it so I just want to know if I'm morally in the clear.

Edit: thank you for the awards!",25873,100govo,"NTA

Everyone needs to make an effort to make a situation like this as easy as possible for everyone involved. That means being a considerate person. 
It seems as though your in-laws never learned basic manners. 

Your kids basic needs trump your FIL's wanting to watch TV at a loud volume in the middle of the night. Constantly disrupted sleep is bad for everyone, but for younger kids it's even worse. The kids shouldn't have to wear ear plugs. Your in-laws could get headphones instead.

So, good for you for drawing a line. They seem to not understand it any other way. If they continue behaving the way they have, they can look for another place to stay.",545,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/100govo/aita_for_putting_parental_controls_on_my_tv_and/
AITA for not wanting to celebrate my mom on MY birthday?,"I have three siblings between the ages of 10 and 18. I'm the oldest fourth at 25. Every year on every single one of our birthday, we're expected to celebrate my mom as well. We've done it since we were little. It was taught to me as 'giving thanks for carrying + giving birth to us'. Which I'm all for, I am grateful as we wouldn't be here without her. The issue is though, it becomes less of our birthday and more-so an anniversary for the day our mom gave birth.

Every year on our birthday our mom gets gifts too. As we got older, we're now expected to get her monetary gifts (and not cards, or homemade stuff). Just recently was my birthday and I was gifted some much needed clothes and dishware for my new apartment. My dad however got my mom a new macbook. My siblings all got her gifts too. My youngest brother isn't expected to give much, but my 16 year old sister and 18 year old 2nd brother work so they're expected to give gifts too. My sister pulled me aside before my birthday and said she was sorry she couldn't get me much (she got me a sweater, I love it!) and that she wanted to get me more but our mom was pressuring her to get a certain necklace for our mom. Apparently my mom had been dropping hints for month and my sister was worried our mom would be upset and feel underappreciated if she didn't get it.

I asked how much it was, and my sister said it was $300. I honestly lost it on our mom and chewed into her later that afternoon when my mom opened her gifts after me. I think she's ridiculous for even wanting my sister to spend so much on a gift! Mom started crying and my dad kicked me out. Mom won't answer calls but my aunt (mom's sister) called and said I was a POS for not respecting my mother and that I'm a selfish, narcissist child for being jealous of the gifts mom got.

I thought I was in the right, but now I don't know. It's been over two weeks and mom won't answer my calls. She's been posting on facebook inspiration quotes about letting go of the toxicity in your life, how blood doesn't equal family, and how hard it is to be a mother. Several family members (aunt, grandma, uncle, and two of my cousins) are replying to the posts and are very obviously directing vague comments at me about being a horrible daughter... Idk what to think now because of how many people are on her side :/

EDIT: Thank you for all your feedback. I think it's really eye opening and I'm going to try to find a therapist so I can unload all this fuckery. Also, thank you for the awards but you don't have to!

"AITA for calling my wife unreasonable for backing out of spending Christmas with my family after my mother rejected her cookie sample""?","
Context: For every holiday, My mother would ask the women in the family (my sisters, sister in-law, my wife, my female cousins) to send ""samples"" of the desserts they plan to bring to the celebration for testing and to see if these desserts could make it to the ""food menu"". My wife has been complaining about my mother deliberately rejecting every dessert sample she sent. So many times my mother has told her that she's being honest and keeping the guests best interest at heart. Yet my wife still thought that my mother is deliberately excluding her since 2 of her dessert samples were rejected before.



For this year's Christmas my mother is doing the same thing but this time, she told every woman who are participating to make a ""cookie sample"" and send it to her for testing. My wife took it as a challenge and to be honest she worked really hard to make a good sample and sent it to my mother days ago and the results just came in yesterday.


I came home from work and found my wife upset. I asked what's wrong and she told me that my mother rejected the sample she sent and decided to exclude her baking from the food list/menu for christmas this year. I didn't know what to say but she then told me she was backing out of the invitation to attend christmas with my family. I was stunned when I heard her make this statement. I tried to talk to her but she said ""it was done"" I called her unreasonable to decide to bail on the whole family over some cookie sample...that's just freaking crazy and quite unreasonable. We had a full on argument about it and she stated that my mother caused this but I told her that my mother is pretty serious and careful about the food she offers to the guests since we are going to have relatives coming from all sides of country. She told me to stop mentioing it.


Later I heard her cry despite telling her that her baking is amazing and people have preferences that's all.



AITA for insisting that her decision was unreasonable?


Info. If you're asking whose cookie sample made it to the menu, the answer is my sister and my 2 cousins.


Info Few things to put on here:

1. My wife wasn't the only one whose sample was rejected. We have SIL's (brother's wife) and my younger sister's.

2. My mother did not force anyone to participate, it was up to whoever wanted to take part.

3. This is just about the dessert since my mother tends to be very careful in this category but for other types of foods. Dishes/appetizers/salads/stuff like that is welcome as she stated.


Update: Great!, so I just got off the phone with my brother and he told me that his wife is doing the same thing as my wife and that she has decided to back out of the invitation to spend christmas with family as well. Turns out my wife must've told her about her decision and she decided to follow her lead. My brother is pissed saying my wife is encouraging his wife to do this. I see that the problem has just gotten bigger now. Who knows, my younger sister might join in and decide not to go as well. I don't know how this got out of control so quickly. I guess we'll try to have a discussion with my mother about this soon and see how it goes.",25720,z01vg2,"YTA. Your wife has been telling you for years that your mother has been *rejecting* her.

AITA for making my stepson walk on his engagement night?,"

The title sounds bad but hear me out.


My stepson Rowan (23) just got engaged to his fiancee, she comes from a highly conservative family and they both won't live together til after Marriage. They're both on great terms and I have to say her parents are a bit much.


So the engagement party was held at a restaurant. I drove my wife, Rowan snd his best friend Jack there because Rowan's car needed some work. Things went quite well, party ended and everyone went home.


On the way back, I had to stop by the store so my could grab something for our 16 year old son. Rowan, Jack and I waited in the car. Rowan and Jack kept laughing then this young lady walked towards us cause her car was parked next to mine in the parking lot. Rowan kept trying to speak to her while she was trying to load her stuff in the car. he and jack kept throwing words at her and she sermed annoyed. Jack then said ""hey, he just wants to look at that a**"" then Rowan said ""Let me see it jiggle, baby"" I was appalled, I told them both to knock it off but then Rowan satcastically replied ""Relax I was just giving her a compliment, bet she don't get many of those often"". The lady got in her car and I started arguing with him about his behavior and shamed him for acting like this on his own engagement night. He argued back saying something about my car and I lost it. I told him to get out immediately, Jack got involved so I kicked him out too. My wife got back and started engaging in the argument sayingI can't let her son walk home from his emgagement party, I replied that her son can't be harrassing other women on the way back from his engagement party but she kept defending him. I told her to either stay or get in the car. She did and I drove off.


Rowan didn't come home and my wife gave me hell for it. we later found out that he was staying at one of his guy friends place. From what I understand, he's pissed at me and refusing to see me. My wife said it was my fault, I escalated the situation ober some stupid shit boys his age do all the time. I told her he can't do this while in my car but she took it as in I was holding it over his head.

AITA for refusing to sell my horse?,"Me(24f) and my boyfriend (26) have been dating for around ~9 months. 

I’ve been riding horses since around four years old when I started taking lessons. When I was ten I started helping out this girl at the stable with her horse Lady. At 12 she told her she had to sell due to time/interest and asked if me and my parents wanted to buy Lady. Luckily for me, my parents were able to buy her and she’s been mine ever since. She’s my bestest friend and I love her a lot.

When I started to date my bf I was very honest with the fact that my horse takes a lot of time and he was fine with this. When single I could spend like three to four hours a day in the stable but as we started dating I cut this down. To about three hours every other day as this is roughly how long it takes for me to do all the cleaning/preparing food/riding. Also most of my friends are at the stable which obviously means this is also social for me. The other days I would not ride and try to spend less time talking which would make it about an hour. After about six months he told me I spent too much time at the stable and I should prioritise my relationship more and somehow his family got involved and saying it was strange to prioritize the way I did. I wasn’t comfortable with this but I am a bit of a pushover so I agreed. 

At first this meant cutting down time at the stable but it has evolved into cutting down riding days. Now I ride about two days a week and the rest I’m simply there to do the basics. All of this as quickly as I can because otherwise I know he’ll be annoyed and pissed of for days and give me the silent treatment. I know my horse isn’t really suffering from not being ridden as often as before but I still feel very guilty that I’m always rushing around her.

Then last night he told me it was time to sell Lady. I laughed at him and asked if he was serious. He was. I told him no and he said I needed to start prioritizing this relationship more and I said I’ve done nothing but prioritize this relationship. We argued about it and he apparently thinks I can just put her down as she’s old anyways. I was furious at this and told him that was absolutely not happening and I would never sell her. He said that any reasonable person would sell or put down their horse in favor of their boyfriend and the only reason I wouldn’t is because I only hang out with other insane horse people. 

So I come to you, reasonable people of Reddit, AITA?

Edit: So I never expected this to get as much attention as it did. I’m very overwhelmed and thankful for all your kind comments and messages. I am currently sitting with Lady in her stable crying my eyes out because this has been such a wake-up call for me. My boyfriend left to visit his family and friends in his old town earlier today before I posted so for everyone worried: all is well for now and I will handle this asap. First I need to go home and sleep. Thank you all for being wonderful ❤️

AITA for screaming at & banning my SIL & niece from my home after they DESTROYED my houseplants?,"**EDIT** PLEASE STOP SENDING ME CHAT MESSAGES I cannot keep up with ALL of the stuff I'm seeing. **YES EVEN IF YOU'RE ABOUT TO SAY ""I KNOW YOU SAID DON'T MESSAGE ME BUT...**

Years ago I got really into houseplants and started to collect them. Over the years Ive had up to 70, but whittled my collection down to about 35, just the ones I really love.

My niece Jenny (14F) has developed an interest in plants and will come over and we will talk about them and she helps with propagation and repotting. 

I had to go out of town for two weeks to take care of some work stuff so I asked SIL and Jenny if they could plant sit for me. I told Jenny I would pay but also give her a few cuttings as a trade off.

They agreed and when they came over I gave a tour and explained the care needed, and also showed off a few prized plants. SIL asked how much a few of them ran me and I did share. This didn't seem weird bc the family knows and Ive gotten some plants as gifts.

Well I returned from my trip and was horrified. They watered and gave the right amount of light, but they also decided to give a lot of my plants haircuts. Big ones.

My prized cebu blue pothos mother plant was destroyed. The climbing one too. My manjula pothos had been done the same. My golden that I trained up my stairwell. My string of pearls, hearts, and ruby necklace all destroyed. My silver stripe philodendron.

The worst was that my pink princess philo had been reduced to two leaves. And my albo monstera is down to three. I don't even think they got nodes necessarily. These plants are expensive and prized. 

I basically broke down and when they came to meet me to give back my key I screamed and screamed at them. Jenny started crying saying I said I would give her cuttings so she thought it was okay. I screamed at her to go home and get what she stole from me and bring it back NOW because SHE KNEW I DIDN'T MEAN SHE COULD DESTROY MY FUCKING PLANTS

SIL got between us and said ""what's done is done

**im sorry i don't know why my one edit is gone!! AHHH and half the original post. please read my comments!!**

I said no way, you're returning EVERYTHING
Jenny said ""Mom already sold most of them on marketplace""
I lost it and just screamed and screamed at them until Jenny was crying and her mom got in my face and told me I was having a tantrum over plants. I told her to get the fuck out of my house and don't EVER come anywhere near me or my home again. I called my brother (SIL husband) and he was shocked and said they told him I said it was all okay.
He brought me the stuff she hadn't sold yet and apologized. I told him I never ever want either of them in the same room as me again, they're horrible, AWFUL, irredeemable people and that I hope they both burn in hell where they belong. He told me he gets that I'm upset but that I'm taking it too far and that family means not holding grudges.
I told him to leave, and I cried for the rest of the day. I am posting because I need to know if my edict is over the top and if I'm overreacting.
So AITA for telling them that they are NO LONGER WELCOME in my home and not even wanting them in the SAME ROOM?",25611,tkcl5b,"NTA

I KNOW EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE PLANTS

You need to update your post. 
An albo cutting sells for 325 where I live. 
Your niece was manipulated by your SIL. Your SIL needs to give you back the money she made off YOUR plants.

People saying these are just plants, let’s replace this with that story where that guy glued those LEGO’s together, people were raging. Those plants are actually expensive.

Again, you need to include the price of one cutting. SIL wanted to make a quick buck and used YOUR hard work to do it.",869,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tkcl5b/aita_for_screaming_at_banning_my_sil_niece_from/
AITA for watching and not doing anything while my wife was being kicked out of my company?,"


Hear me out, just read the whole text.


So my wife, F (26) and I, M (33) been married for 2 years. I admit that she is a hothead and can be a bit much especially when shes mad at me. I take responsibility for any mistake j make like not cleaning the bathroom after the shower or filling her car with gas after using it. I even stand there and let her unload her anger and frustration on me BUT only at home and not in public. She tends to start arguing with me in public instead of waiting til we get home. 

Recently she's been coming to my workplace to berate me over something I did the night before like not getting the stuff I said I would get or doing the stuff I said I would do. It's embarrassing and humiliating,iating and has been affecting my job to the point where I started getting a warning after a warning from my superiors who, I believe have been very patient and understanding especially when my wife makes a fuss at the office.


Last week I was in the middle of a 2hr meeting and next thing I knew was seeing my wife barge in while yelling at me asking why I was keeping my phone turned off (I had to turn it off after getting warnings about I since she forbid me from turning it off). I was stunned, because my superior and co workers AND potential clients were there. I didn't even move my superior dealt with it and called security to get her out. My wide started arguing with him telling him she came for me then started urging me to get off my seat and tell them to back off. But I didn't I just watched as security escorted her out. It was horrible because I had a fear that my job was lost. She yelled at me repeatedly to get them to stop but she got kicked out eventually. 

I got told she's no longer allowed there and that this was going to be my final, last warning. I apologized then went home. She was there waiting then yelled about me watching and doing nothing whole she was getting mistreated and kicked out. I finally snapped and said she was over the line, made a scene that risked my job over few missed calls. She started crying saying I still should've defended her after getting humiliated infront of my co workers but told her she didn't have to worry about it because she's no longer allowed there. She got more furious and went to her mom's to stay there.",25597,usc7y3,NTA. This is a form of abuse and I would take this with a strong understanding that things are getting worse.

AITA for taking an Uber to a wedding so I wouldn't be late?,"My sister got married last weekend.  I flew into town and my parents insisted that I stay with them instead of a hotel like I wanted.  

My parents are consistently late for everything.  I think it's a Latin thing.  I hate being late.  I think it's disrespectful.  

The wedding was at 2:30.  My folks live about half an hour from the church.  

Noon rolls up and my folks aren't even getting ready yet.  

They are adults and I am over dealing with them. 

I get ready. I send for an Uber and I am at the church for 2:00. 

I check in with my sister.  She asks me if I had any problems getting my parents to church. I told her that I came by myself.  Shebw my white and said that I was responsible for getting them there on time.  

Well nobody asked me to do that.  I didn't even want to stay there.  

So now everyone starts calling my parents.  They are getting ready.  

They were about 35 minutes late.  

The service was shortened because there was another wedding later that day.  

Everyone is still mad at me for not getting my parents there on time.  My aunt said that I'm an asshole for messing up the timing of the wedding. 

My mom says it's my fault for not reminding them to get ready.

AITA for refusing my to buy my fiancé gaming laptop for a few grand after he told me to find a real job?,"My fiancé (m37) and I (f30) have started living together 6 months ago. I own a house and he moved in with me. I run online business from home which allows me to live rather comfortably. 
A month after moving in, he quit his job saying how much he hated it and that he’s going to try and do twitch streaming for a living. 
Im all for following your passion so I was supportive although surprised at the turn of events. I am in financial position to support us both but it felt off.

Anyway, nothing happened with his twitch channel. Sure, he’s gaming all day but hasn’t bothered to even try and create an account, he just games for pleasure. It’s been 7 months. 
I’ve had conversations with him suggesting he finds work but he keeps telling me that I’m unsupportive and he needs time.

He wanted us to buy a bigger house together but I said that I’m fine with my current one and that since he doesn’t have a job, I don’t want to get mortgage and be left with paying everything and he told me that if I found a real job maybe I wouldn’t have financial problems.
We had a massive argument that night.
Now, he’s been hinting at needing new gaming laptop which costs a few grand and I’ve been ignoring it so he asked outright for me to buy it for his birthday.

I told him no that my fake job doesn’t cover new laptops and he got really pissed at me, telling me I’m selfish and am ruining his career.
Granted, I can afford it to buy it but he really hurt me saying my business is not a real job despite me working my ass off.

AITA? for refusing to sign anything while my eyes are blindfolded?,"


Eversince I got out of the hospital for chronic problems, My husband has been introducing me to some games every evening. One game used to be about doing things while my eyes are blindfolded. involving puzzles, ruby's cube, shaped objects et cetra.... We'd take turns to do it just for entertainment.



Just a couple of days ago, he's been trying to get me to sign papers while wearing a blind fold. I refused to do it because he never lets me take a look at what I'm signing neither before or after. He says that he was just trying to see if I could leave the same signature everytime I sign but I couldn't help feel uncomfortable. I told him I don't want to play this game unless and until he shows me the papers first, he said ""nevermind then"" and stopped bringing it up.


Last night, he tried to convince me to give it a try and even volunteered to go first, I asked if he was going to show me what I was going to sign and he made a face and said no, it's the rules and I should respect them. I refused and he kept on about how I keep acting worried and suspicious for no reason. he said I clearly don't trust him and he was hurt by finding that out now after everything we been through. We had an argument and I told him to drop it and not bring it up again, period. He was mad despite saying it was no big deal, he was obviously upset with me and kept talking about how I don't trust him and that I was out of line to assume or suspect anything from him like this.

AITA for getting my boyfriend arrested,"Edit 8/21: I did leave a comment with an update for those who wanted to know



I’ll just get straight to it. I’m a college student and this is my last semester until medical school. I’ve never been able to get a loan I’ve worked 5 1/2 years to get this degree because I have to pay out of pocket so it takes way longer. I’ve worked two sometimes three jobs at a time and barely had a social life. For this upcoming semester I reached my goal for tuition so I quit one of my jobs so I could relax a bit. I was a server/bartender at two bars and an office job so I always have cash hidden in my apartment in my closet in box and before the semester starts a week or two before I deposit it so I can pay my tuition. My boyfriend sometimes stays over while I’m there or when I’m not. Since I’ve been saving for this semester he’s the only one who’s been over I’ve never told him about the box but he knows I have to pay for school. Well yesterday night I get home to put money in the box because I was gonna deposit it today and it’s all gone. I freaked out and tore my apartment up thinking I put it somewhere else knowing I didn’t. I called my boyfriend like crazy no answer. I didn’t sleep last night I was panicking. Then this morning he finally calls me back I’m yelling at him about my money he’s acting all confused and like I’m crazy. He comes over I’m still pissed off after a while he finally admits he took it so he can borrow and he’ll pay me back. Where tf is he gonna get $14,000 from in two weeks?! I went into a rage and called the police and reported a theft because that is what he did. Well it’s been hours now I guess he got his phone call because his family has been blowing my phone up and his mother has said some really hurtful and racist things to me. They’ve been harassing me for the past 6 hours now it’s stressing me out even more and I hate that I’m feeling bad for him but he stole my money that I’ve been saving for months. His brother did call and he was respectful and said they’ll help him pay it back and I should just go to the police station with him and tell them I want to drop the charges but I really don’t believe them. I could do that and never get my money back still. I don’t know what to do and I hate that I’m contemplating doing this. I’m just really pissed off and have been crying all fucking day.",25505,w4p8lg,"Hi everyone,

Sorry I kept you all hanging for a while but it’s been a long and annoying process. I want to thank all of you so so much for all the advice. Someone suggested when I go to school talk to my emergency dean and I am so grateful for you! With the police report I was able to get my school to pay for my semester again to that person thank you thank you thank you. I started a week late but a week late is better then not going. Sadly the harassment continued and escalated and due to what almost happened and all the text and calls I was able to get a temporary restraining order on his mom which she quickly violated smh. After a few weeks I was able to get a little bit over $8k back from my money and his brother did pay the remaining back to me (don’t worry everyone we didn’t meet it was through a third party). Also like most of you said depending on the state you can’t drop charges after the fact so I couldn’t do anything after the money was given back at this point it’s up the court what happens. We haven’t spoken nor do I care to. I’m finally moving in a month which is a huge stress reliever because they won’t know where I live anymore, a police report helps with a lot of things I got to break my lease thank God! Also won’t keep my money home anymore. Thankfully since this is my last semester I won’t have to work my bar jobs anymore so no more money in my closet. I think that’s all I have to update you all on. Again thank you so much to all of you for your encouraging words and advice it meant a lot helped more then you can imagine.",635,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/w4p8lg/aita_for_getting_my_boyfriend_arrested/
AITA for refusing my future sister in law's request to dye my hair for my brother's wedding?,"My future SIL Liz has turned into a bridezilla and is going to war with everyone over every stupid thing.

My natural color is red. I love my hair. Liz is a blonde but she loves to have red hair and in fact ever since meeting me she's been dying her hair almost exactly my color. I don't mind, I think it's weird that she does it but I don't have a monopoly over this particular shade of red and she's free to do with her hair whatever she wants.

Well, she asked me this week that I should dye my hair to a different color because she wants her hair to be unique in her wedding, she offered to cover all the costs as well. I just said no because it's my hair, I don't want it changed.

I told my brother and he told me to do whatever I want because it's my hair, he said he'll talk to Liz to get her to back off. Well it didn't work because Liz has come to my parents and they've taken her side! They say it's her special day and we need to be more accomodating and it's important for our future relationship that we get along. I believe I am accomodating, she can do whatever she wants with her own hair! How is my hair any of her business anyway.

My parents tell me that I should be the bigger person. I don't know why an 18 year old should be the bigger person compared to the 27 year old Liz. They told me I'm making this minor issue into a big problem and I should just do what she wants because it's her wedding.

"AITA for ""demanding"" my GF to change her dress for a wedding?","This happened during this weekend, me being in my early thirties and my gf in her late twenties. I was invited to a wedding ceremony of a colleague and could bring someone with me. I asked my GF that I've been dating for a year if she would like to join me and she was really happy because she apparently loves weddings. Since we don't live together I drove to pick her up so we'd have some time to spare before the ceremony.

As she comes out she looks really beautiful and has obviously put in time to fix her hair and make-up. She's also wearing an off-white dress that was rather ornate. As she got in I told her that she looked stunning, but I asked if she could change to a different colored dress for the ceremony. I'm not one for etiquette by far, but one of the few things I have heard everywhere is that you should not wear a white dress to a wedding unless you're the bride. She became pretty upset and wanted to know what was wrong with her dress. I said that it would be inappropriate to wear a white or off-white dress unless you're the bride - and that it's like wedding-law or something, trying to be lighthearted about it. She rolled her eyes and said that it was an outdated tradition about women and virginity and that when her friends got married everyone wore white and that it's not a big thing anymore.

I told her that I don't know what the dress code is for this ceremony, but since it's not saying ""all white clothes"" I still thought she should change to another color but white or ""almost-white"" - because my colleague was getting married and we had no idea how she felt about it. My gf became really upset and told me that I was trying to control what she was wearing and that it was abusive, which honestly made me really upset and hurt. I said something along the lines of ""Fuck, well you shouldn't go to a wedding with an abuser then"" and then I told her to fuck off out of my car. She began to cry and wanted to apologize and give me a hug, but I just told her to get out, which she did (EDIT: To clarify we never left the driveway by her home, I did not drop her off in the middle of nowhere or anything like that).
    
I drove off and she called and texted me a bunch. I answered ""I don't want to talk right now"" and then turned my phone off and attended the ceremony. The bride was the only one that was wearing white so I feel as if my gut feeling was the right one. When I got home my phone had blown up by texts from her and her best friend saying that I was being inconsiderate and controlling and should apologize for my behavior. I've vented to a few friends - most of them agreeing with me but some have said that it was an asshole thing to tell her that she could not wear her dress - because it had nothing to do with me. I feel as if I was in the right since it was my colleagues wedding and it was better to be safe than sorry, but I'm also not sure if I was being an asshole about the situation. So, reddit AITA?


UPDATE: I never expected this thread to get this many replies. I am incredibly thankful for all of you that have reached out and commented, and I really really appreciate that you've taken the time to tell me. My GF found out about the thread (don't know if she knew my handle, or just found it) and we talked over the phone. She apologized and I apologized and it was a pretty good talk. She asked if she could come over, and I said no and that it would be best for us to go our separate ways. She got upset and asked why I wouldn't even try to work it out. I basically just said good bye and then she said my dick was small which actually made me laugh after what had been a pretty mature conversation and then she hung up. I'm pretty sad about it, she really made me feel happy but as many of you have commented - if this was our first disagreement and she called me abusive how would future disagreements look? I was hurt, but if she did think I was being abusive, it would be the right thing to do, and if she did not think I was being abusive and said it anyways I would not want to be with her. So anyways I think things worked out for the best for us both.

AITA for yelling at my husband and telling him to get over himself after he threw away my tampon box?,"
We (Me 27, him 30) together for 3, married for 2 months.


So here's a thing, I used to use pads for my periods but recently was able to start using tampons (I have medical problems) in comparison, Tampons work 10x better for me, especially when I'm outside...say like at work or traveling. My husband Ryan hates them, he never truely gave a reason other than just say...he doesn't feel comfortable with *me* using *them* . I didn't think it was a big deal at first since he said he hates a lot of stuff that I do but ""puts up"" with it anyway except for this. He asked that I go back to using pads but I made it clear since it's my body then I get to decide.


He threw away some tampons he had access to, and I was getting upset but*!!!!* to keep the peace, I just bought a box and hid it away from him. he somehow found it and threw it away. I didn't find that out til I had my period yesterday and realized I had no tampons to use. I was tired, and too stressed I just yelled at him after he admitted to throwing away the whole box. He argued that I already knew how he felt about *this stuff* and yet I decided to still *keep it around*. I lost it and told him he had no right to do this and told him to get over himself already. He stared at me almost about to tear up or something, then walked out.


He later went on about how we, as a couple should take each other's discomfert into consuderation and said he already tried to speak to me about those tampons yet I brushed him off and insulted him and verbally abused him. He also said that if I still insist on using them then I should do it while I'm outside the house but I said that it won't happen. I feel bad for how it played out but I was just at my wet's end and in so much pain I lashed out.

AITA for not attending my husband's celebration dinner due to the restaurant not having anything I could eat?,"My husband has been working really hard the last two years to advance at his company and he finally got the promotion he's been after. I'm really, really proud of him. His parents are too and wanted to take us all out to dinner to celebrate. My husband absolutely loves prime rib and there's only one place in our area that serves it so he picked that restaurant. Thing is- I'm not fond of steak. I'll eat it but very rarely. I prefer chicken or fish. I looked up the menu before leaving and right now they have a limited menu. The place had only one fish entree and two chicken entrees, and none of them sounded good for various reasons. I suggested that he pick someplace else so everyone can eat. He refused citing that we rarely get to go to this place but go to other places in our area regularly which is true, but those places have lots of variety so everyone can eat.

He suggested that I ask if they could prepare the fish or chicken without the marinades or sauces but I didn't want to be difficult for the kitchen staff. His next suggestion was that I order dessert while everyone else ate entrees and then when we were done, he would take me where I wanted so I could eat dinner while he and the kids ate dessert. So I opted to just not go because I didn't want to sit there not eating and not having a good time while everyone else was. My husband asked me to go so he could celebrate with the people most important to him. I told him no again and that he needed to get going before he was late. He did go but came back a little over an hour later with the kids and they all had to go boxes. He said he couldn't think of what to tell the kids about why I didn't go when they kept asking without lying or making me sound bad so he just got an order for them to go and let the kids spend some time with their grandparents talking in the parking lot. I told him he should had stayed but he said that I put him in a bad spot with the kids and that I knew he wanted everyone there and that I should've just gotten over my picky eating for one night. I maintain if he really wanted us to all eat dinner as a family then he should've picked a restaurant with a more accomodating menu.

AITA?

AITA for making my chronically late friend miss her seminar?,"My friend [25F] is constantly late for everything. Be it work-related or fun activities, she will always be at least 15-20 minute late. She does not have a car, and so oftentimes I [25M] will pick her up from her house (I work at a university and she is a PhD student there, and her place is along the way for me). 

Last time I offered her a ride to work, she ended up being 20 minutes late after I've already arrived at her place. Because of that, I ended up being late for work. She is always very apologetic about her lateness, but never changes.

This week she was supposed to give a seminar at the university which is a crucial part of her PhD program. She asked me if I could give her a ride to work that day. I told her sure, but that I was picking her up at 8 AM and she must be there exactly at 8 AM, and not a minute later. She chuckled, but I told her I wasn't joking, and she promised that she will be there. 

The morning of her seminar, I drove to her place and got there at 7:55, and texted her that I was here, and she told me should would be out in ""just a minute"". At 8:00, there was no indication that she would come out (and she didn't text anything), so at 8:01, I drove off. 

At around 8:20, she called me asking me where I was. I told her I was at work and that I wasn't joking when I told her that she had to be ready right that minute. She started screaming and crying over the phone, and told me that she was having a hard time that morning couldn't be ready right at 8 AM. She then begged me to come back to pick up her, as her seminar is at 9 AM and she needed to be at the school before then. I could've done it quick enough to pick her up and drop her off without affecting my work, but I decided I didn't want to do that, and told her that I won't. 

She was crying and hyperventilating at that point and said she'd promise to never be late for anything else again, and reemphasized that this seminar was crucial for her PhD and that she absolutely cannot miss it without severe consequence. I responded ""oh well"", and hung up. I then went about my day at work normally. 

I feel like could've went back and picked her up in this scenario since it wouldn't have been detrimental to me and at the same time this was something very important for her. On the other hand, I feel like this should be a wake-up call for her chronic lateness.

EDIT: thank you everyone for the kind words. 
To answer a few common questions:
Yes, she did miss her seminar and apparently got into big trouble with the school. I don't think it's going to ruin her PhD, but there definitely are consequences.

AITA for banning my MIL from the house after I discovered that she's installed a camera in the bedroom?,"

My husband (M33) got into a car accident almost a month ago, He's been bedridden due to a back injury and I've been his primary caregiver. The pressure has been too much from my MIL, she keeps telling me to take care of him and be there for him constantly. She begged me to take time of work and I did, asked me to send her hourly updates about his condition (first 2 weeks) but when I don't she'd get mad and cause an issue. She visits everyday but doesn't do anything to help, alternatively, she'd list all the things I should or shouldn't do. The family keeps telling me she's just worried sick for her son so I try to stay calm.


Days ago, she called to berate me about not replacing the sheets quickly, I had no idea how she found out since my husband didn't call her. My sister inlaw called me to tell me that her mom installed a camera in the bedroom to see if I was taking proper care of her son. I was stunned, after searching the room I found the camera, I called my MIL and had a huge fight with her. She admitted it and said she was just feeling concerned and wanted to make sure her son was being cared for (despite him calling her everyday) I yelled at her telling her that she's no longer allowed into my home after this. She lost it and went on a rant about how I'm stopping her from seeing her son and that not seeing him will literally make her sick herself. The family called me later to get me to back out of this decision but I told them she breached my privacy and took advantage of the situation, they said I'm taking it too personally and that I can't blame a concerned mother for wanting to make sure her son's fine, especially since she listed things she thought I was doing wrong. I ended the conversation but my husband is upset telling me I'm being vindictive and that if his mom can't come then he'll move there with her. We argued then I went outside and he's been silent eversince.

AITA for my response after my BIL said my dress was inappropriate for a family gathering?,"
Ugh! Hear me out!


So My bil (my husband's brother) was married to a women from Greece, Her name is *""Nana""*, and the reason for their divorce was because of how much my conservative bil tried to control her cloths and the places she went. He didn't want the divorce and was hopping Nana would accept the life he offered and stay but she didn't.


This happened 2 years ago, he now moved back with my inlaws and we'd see him more often. He tried to comment on how I dress on multiple ocassions and it's unbearable. but since my inlaws said he's struggling and depressed then I let it go.

On friday my inlaws celebrated my husband's 30th birthday at their home. I wore a heart-shaped blue dress and had my hair up. While we were eating my BIL pointed at me and said that my cleavage was showing and that I shouldn't have wore this dress because it looked inappropriate for a family gathering. I was utterly shocked, everyone was staring at me and I felt so embarrassed and on the spot. He looked at me waiting for me to blow up probably but I laughed and told him ""Knock, knock! he said ""Who’s there?"", I said ""Nana"". Now he paused and seemed confused at the mention of this name. He then faked a laugh and said ""Nana who?"" I said ""Nana your goddamn business what I’m wearing! ok!"". He got upset and quickly left the table. My SILs laughed but my husband and his parents were upset and later said that I was way out of line for bringing up Nana to my BIL knowing how heartbroken and depressed he is because of her. His mom said that I was petty and didn't need to dig at him just to prove a point.

AITA for returning the shoes I got for my husband after he accused me of stealing from him?,"
My [29] husband [36] is the breadwinner of the family. I stay home with the kids who are preschool age. He pays for the mortgage, bills, household needs, food, kids needs.....etc he has set a monthly budget for each category and handles getting everything done. Recently, he has become overwhelmed and told me to handle grocery shopping but before he let me, he asked me to write a list of all the stuff we need so he could calculate the total and also so he'd have an idea how much I'll be spending when I take his credit card. I didn't have an issue with that because this way we'd watch our spending habits. however, he said I'm never allowed to get something that isn't on the list unless I'm paying for it some other way.



On friday I was doing some grocery shopping as usual and saw that the store had some nice shoes on sale. the price was insanly low for this brand and so I decided to grab a pair for my husband thinking he'd be happy with them since he needed new sneakers anyway. I bought them and when I showed them to him he flipped out on me saying I made a huge mistake by buying something that was not on the list. I agreed with him but I thought that since the shoes were for him then it'd be different, he said I screwed up and shouldn't have bought those sneakers without even telling him. but in my defense I said that the price was low so it's not like I spent $100 on shoes, and also I saw this as a great deal and wanted him to have those nice sneakers. He plainly said that what I did is considered ""stealing"" since he never consented to have those sneakers purchased and said that I'm being irresponsible with money that is why I no longer have an income and my spending habits need a ""grib"". I felt hurt by what he said. We argued about it for hours and he avoided speaking to me the rest of the day.

The next day I went and returned the sneakers and took the money back. He got home in the evening and lost it when he found out I returned them. He said he couldn't believe how petty and childish I was to do actually do this. I explained I was just correcting my ""mistake"". he tried to contact the store and was told the sneakers were already sold. He got even angrier with me but I told him that he accused me of stealing for him when I was just trying to do a nice gesture for him, He yelled that I had a lot of nerve calling what I did ""nice gesture"" while using his money to do it. I told him he had no right to yell at me after I corrected my ""mistake"" and gave back the money he accused me of stealing.


He threw a fit then went out with his friends and came home late at night still not talking to me.

AITA for disinviting my siblings from my wedding,"There's me (25f,) sister (27f) and brother (28m) involved here.

We were raised together and until 2019 we believed we were a nuclear biological family. Then we found out our dad wasn't our bio dad, which even he didn't know, it then turned out my older siblings shared a bio dad but I had a different one. We were also first cousins because their bio and my bio were brothers.

Dad left our mom, hurt, betrayed, and overall disgusted that she had lied to him for two decades. I was equally mad that she lied and hurt my dad. My siblings were less willing to cut her off but their relationship strained majorly.

Dad moved in with me and my then boyfriend, now fiance, and Covid hit. At this point all three of us agreed he was dad no matter what. And there was nothing that could change that.

I meant it; they didn't.

They found their bio father and mine by extension, and have decided that he is now ""real dad"" and that our dad is just a stepdad. My brother has even corrected his two little girls who called dad grandpa, into saying he's stepgrandpa and that's what they call him, while bio gets called grandpa.

It broke my dad's heart and he decided it was too much for him to accept. This is after talks between them where he was essentially told to know his place, stay in his lane and demoted with the clear message being nothing would change. I am so pissed at them. They have tried to push me to meet my ""real dad"" and have told me it's okay to go back on what we said.

Initially, they were invited to my wedding but with this whole mess I told them they were no longer welcome and I did not want them to show up. They told me that just because they have a relationship with their ""real dad"" doesn't change things between us. I told them it does. That if dad isn't our real dad after EVERYTHING he has done for us then we're not ""real siblings"", because technically we are HALF siblings and cousins. That my dad is till my dad 100% and biology is meaningless to me. And so it was best for them not to come, because I no longer want them there.

What I said hurt them. My SIL (married to my brother) told me I was an asshole for throwing half in their faces and cutting them from my wedding like we haven't been siblings our whole lives. I think that's almost more annoying to me, because that's our dad. But he can be shit on and discarded like he's nothing.

AITA for removing the bedroom lock after my husband ignored a family emergency?,"Background about my husband : He stays up late at night and has to wake up early to go to work. So when he gets home at 5, he has to get his 2hrs nap so he could both make up for lack of sleep and also be ready to stay up late to play with his console. 

He values his sleep and has one rule in the house that he enforces strictly, which is to not be interrupted while sleeping. He literally put a sign on the bedroom door saying 'DO.NOT.WAKE.ME.UP"" under any circumstances, just no, unless someone's hurt or dead though; in this case he said he still wouldn't be of much help anyway. The kids and I would sometimes wake him up but for serious reasons. He got mad and started locking the door. I get no access to the room for 2 hours but that's not the main problem.


This past tuesday, my 3yo son had hot oil spill on his hand while his 14yo sister was cooking, I heard him scream and saw that the oil was covering his hand and half of his arm, I brought the first aid kit but he was in so much pain and his skin looked really bad. I rushed to wake my husband up, I kept knocking but got no response so I tried to open it but it was locked. I spent a while between knocking on the door (he had his phone turned off) and getting dressed after my daughter asked the neighbor to drive us to the hospital. I couldn't wast more time cause my son was crying. The neighbor took us to the hospital and I couldn't help feel livid the whole time. We got home and my husband was pacing around asking wherever were and why I didn't answer his texts. I blew up on him after I showed him our son's injury and told him that I pounded on the door to wake him up but he said had his earbuds on and didn't hear a thing. I called him reckless and neglectful for ignoring a family emergency. He said I could say the same thing about myself for leaving our son unsupervised and causing him to get a burn. I stopped arguing and went to remove the bedroom door lock, he started yelling at me saying I had no right. I refusedto respond I just walked off to calm down. He didn't stop complaining calling me bossy and saying that by removing the lock I've destroyed his peace and quiet and caused him sleep deprivation. He's insisting I put it back but I refused.

Now they want to live together but they both approached me and asked me to let her fiancé take over my lease and for me to find a new place as soon as possible. I have a few problems with this I feel like they should find a new place together because I’ve lived here longer. I also told V a few months ago that I spoke to the landlord about once our lease together is up that I’ll be living alone since I can now afford it. At that time she agreed and said that her and her boyfriend would look for a place together. I told her this but she said that when they started looking for a new place that everything else was too expensive and it made for sense for me to move out and not her. I refused and told her that she can always ask the landlord if there will be units available for them in our building. She started cussing me out and has had her fiancé and their friends harassing me about it.

AITA for allowing my terminally ill daughter to smoke and drink?,"Hello, I am the (42) father to a 16 year old girl.

About 3 months ago we found out via a visit to the hospital that our daughter had a late stage form of brain cancer and were told that survival was not likely. We tried anyway, but despite our best efforts we found no improvement in the cancer. My daughter is aware of this.

Well, recently, my wife was looking for a hair straightener my daughter had borrowed and found a few grams of marijuana, an elf-bar vape, as well as a partially empty handle of Tito's Vodka in her bedroom. When confronted, my daughter confessed to have been using these substances for about a month at that point. She said that since she knew she wasn't likely going to survive past 18, she wanted to try these things socially, and assured us she was being responsible with them.

I myself am a user of these substances, as we live in a legal state. I do not vape, though I do smoke cigarettes, drink, and will occasionally roll myself a joint. While normally I would not want my children using these, I thought I could make an exception due to the circumstances. My wife, however, disagrees. She only drinks a glass of wine every now and then, and dislikes nicotine and marijuana.

We had a conversation and came to the conclusion that she would be allowed to do these things under my supervision, as long as they are from retail stores and dispensaries and not street dealers, though my wife remains adamant she should not be doing them at all.

AITA for sneaking out of the restaurant after my fiance told me to pay for his and his friends meal?,"


I (F33) have been engaged to my fiance (M37) for 5 months. We don't share finance because that's what he wants. I got a raise on my salary. now I earn 30% more than he does and I noticed that he's been using this to ask me to pay for him and his friends. Whenever I say ""no"" or ""why should I pay for this?"" he'd respond with ""the 30% that's why"". he acts as if the 30% is unfair or that I'm not dserveing of it.


Several times he has tricked me to pay for his and his friend's meals by asking me publicly. Let me say that I'm too nice to say ""no"", I hate confrontation especially when we're at a public place like a restaurant so I just grin and pay.


Last tuesday, he asked me to join him and his buddies for dinner. I told him from the start I wasn't paying for their food and he shouldn't expect me to. He said he ""got this"" and ""no worries"".


We got to the restaurant. Met his friends, ordered food. And in the middle of the meal he leaned in and whispered that I would be paying for everything he and his friends ordered. I got so mad I whispered back ""noooo"" but he probably relied on me not causing a scene in public and infront of his friends. he said ""you have enough money you could pay for everyone's food, 30% remember?"".


I was fuming inside. instead of reacting negatively and losing my temper. I waited til the bills arrived (they were already split from the start when we first ordered) I paid for mine then I excused myself to the restroom. I then sneaked out from there, got into my car and went home.


I started getting phonecalls from my fiance then texts asking where I was. I texted back saying I didn't appreciate how he put me in this situation and basically tricking me into paying for his and his friends food. I told him I went home then stopped replying. An hour later he came and started yelling at me calling me selfish, irrational, cheapskate and childish for sneaking out like that and leaving him stuck with a bill he could not pay (He had to call his brother for help). We had a loud argument then he walked out.

"AITA for kicking my sister out of our family dinner after she made a ""practical observation""?","My brother 'Fred' and his wife 'Sarah', are not very financially stable, so it was a bit of a surprise for my sister, 'Katie' and I when they announced that they were pregnant. However, we kept it to ourselves. A few months ago, Katie planned a family trip. Brother and SIL decided to opt out as they were cutting costs for the baby. At this, mom and dad decided to cancel the trip altogether and have another one later, since mom's health wasn't too great either. This greatly irked Katie as she was really looking forward to this trip and made some very unsubtle remarks that Fred and Sarah shouldn't be having children if they don't have money. This very clearly upset both of them.

Unfortunately, due to several complications, the baby was stillborn. It has been a month, and my brother and SIL are understandably still devastated. Especially my SIL's mental health is not very well as of now.

Yesterday, I hosted a little family dinner at my home, with sister, brother, SIL and our parents. Some time before dinner, SIL went to the bathroom, and meanwhile, my husband asked Fred if she was doing well. Before Fred could reply, Katie jumped in and said, ""Well, though the loss is very sad, think of this as a good thing. At least you don't have to worry about money anymore. As I said, you shouldn't be bringing kids into this world unless you are sure you can provide for them.""

Fred went red-faced and said that they WOULD have been able to provide for their child. They may not have money for extra luxuries, but they would do everything for their child. He was almost crying and purple with anger, so I quickly dragged Katie away to the kitchen and demanded what had possessed her to say something so insensitive.

She got incredibly defensive and said that she had made a very practical observation and she was 100% correct. It was better to see straight than be clouded by emotions. By that time, Sarah had come out of the bathroom and was shocked to see Fred in tears. She kept on getting hysterical and asking what was wrong. I knew that Katie's presence would ruin things further, and I asked her to get out. She looked incredibly hurt and angry, but went out anyway.

Fortunately, our parents were late and didn't have to see the whole spectacle. When they came home and found out what had happened, they were shocked and upset at Katie too, but mom thinks that perhaps I shouldn't have kicked Katie out like this. AITA?

AITA for going “bridezilla” after my bridesmaid spilled wine on my wedding dress?,"I (27 F) got married a month ago. My dress was this long, lacy gown that my mom wore at her wedding. My mom passed away about 2 years ago. 

Because the dress was so important to me, I had a big plan to keep it safe from any damages. I would only wear the dress at the wedding itself, and I would switch to a more casual dress for the reception. When I was wearing the dress, I wouldn’t eat or drink anything except water, and I would stay inside at all times.

I promise I’m not usually this crazy about cleanliness, but this was my mom’s dress, and the thought of it being damaged broke my heart. But I also knew I wanted to wear it when I got married to have a piece of her with me. She adored this dress and always dreamed I would wear it. 

My bridesmaids knew very well about my particularities with the dress. I had a room above the venue where I was getting ready. My dress was hanging in a safe place in the room. 

On the day of the wedding, I went down to check on something for the wedding, leaving my bridesmaids in the room. Here’s what happened, as they told it to me:

They opened a bottle of Pinot Noir (my favorite) as a celebration. They poured themselves glasses and began to walk around checking out the room. One of my bridesmaids, “Anna,” (27 F) wanted to get a closer look at my dress. She got really close to it, and she started touching the lace. Somehow, her hand holding the wine glass slipped, and wine spilled all over the bottom of the dress. 

When I came upstairs, they told me what happened, and I started sobbing. My maid of honor called several professional cleaners, and they said there was no way they could get the dress in before the wedding. They told us ways to save the dress until we could get it into them, so my MOH started doing that.

After that call, I became extremely angry. I asked “Anna” what the hell she was doing holding red wine so close to my dress when she knew how careful I was being. She dismissed it and said it wasn’t such a big deal because I was planning to wear the dress, so it could have gotten damaged that way too. 

I couldn’t believe she said that. I called her thoughtless and careless and stupid. I told her that she was no longer part of the wedding and that I wanted her to leave. She left, and neither of us have reached out to the other since. 

I got married in the dress I had planned to wear for the reception, and I was heartbroken not to be wearing my mom’s dress. After the wedding, my bridesmaids joked that I was a bridezilla for kicking “Anna” out after she made a “honest mistake.” 

I absolutely don’t think I’m the AH or a bridezilla because Anna’s reaction was so horrible and insincere. But I wanted to get the story off my chest and ask some people who might be more impartial, AITA?",24834,w4jwp3,"NTA at all.

AITA for not spending this Christmas in the hospital with my daughter?,"My (39F) daughter (16F) has had a sensitive stomach ever since she was a kid. There are certain foods that will upset her stomach to the point where she's unable to stop throwing up.

We've seen countless doctors, but so far nobody's been able to give us a clear answer. The only advice we keep getting is to identify all trigger foods and cut them from her diet. We have a pretty good idea of what those foods are: soda and other carbonated drinks, chips, cheetos, and other similar processed snacks, anything oily or fried and most sweets. Unfortunately, this is exacty the kind of stuff my daughter loves to eat the most. And as horrible as she feels after she has them, she still refuses to cut them out of her diet, which in turn led to her spending a lot of time in the hospital during the past few years.

When she was little, it was easier to keep all these foods away from her because I simply wouldn't buy them. But now that she's older, I can't always be there to check what she eats. She eats the greasy pizza at her school's cafeteria, she trades her lunch with her classmates, she goes out with her friends and stops to eat at KFC and so on. And it always ends with her in the ER, crying and shaking because she can't stop throwing up.

This was the case on this Christmas eve as well, when our whole family gathered at our place. And of course, among the many dishes at our Christmas table were some of her main trigger foods, like chips, soda, chocolate and sweets. Now mind you, these were far from the only foods available to her. We also had a variety of home-cooked, traditional dishes on the table, with ingredients that don't upset her stomach, like vegetables, meat, dairy etc. All of them delicious and well-seasoned - my daughter herself says she really likes most of these dishes. 

Despite this, my daughter chose to eat nothing but her trigger foods. I reminded her that they'd make her feel awful, but she said she didn't care, because *Christmas is only once a year* and she *just wants to live a little*. Well, this ended with her violently throwing up in the ER a few hours later. She had to be hospitalized for a few days and only just got out of the hospital a few hours ago.

And unlike all the previous times when something like this happened, this time I chose to spend my Christmas relaxing at home with the rest of our family, and not in the hospital by my daughter's side. I kept in touch with her through calls and texts, and told her that if she needed anything I'd ask a family member to bring it to her, but I made it clear that I would not be visiting her during her stay.

And well, my daughter didn't take this too well. She cried every time we talked on the phone, begged me to come over, told me how horrible I was for 'abandoning' her there all alone and so on. Most of our family didn't take my side in this either, and during the past few days I got called everything from 'a little extreme' to downright cruel and heartless.

AITA for calling my husband unreasonable for canceling the holiday trip just because me and the kids coupdn't help him in an emergency?,"My husband and I have been together for 4 years. I have two kids (17m /19f). and their half brother is 3 years old.



this past week. My husband had an emergency (dad had a medical emergency) and wanted someone to watch our son. he asked my older son and he refused because he was going out with friends. he also asked my daughter but she locked herself in her room to study. I was at the restaurant with my brother meeting his girlfriend for the first time. My husband ended up taking our son with him to the hospital and his mom watched him from there.


He came home and was lashing out on everybody. Calling us selfish and unfeeling. I tried to explain that the kids were busy but he told me to get the f out with that bull because my older son could've skipped the hangout and watched his brother and, my daughter could've watched her brother while studying instead of locking herself in her room. He scolded me as well but I told him I couldn't leave lunch with my brother since he was visiting town and this was my only chance to meet his girlfriend.

He yelled some more than told us that he was canceling the family holiday trip for christmas this year. The two older kids were upset and said it was unfair. I called him unreasonable to cancel the trip and punish the kids (and possibly me) like that. he refused to discuss it later. Now me and the kids aren't speaking to him and he's saying ""good riddance""


*edit My husband was supposed to watch our son at the time. That's why I went to see my brother at the restaurant. The kids aren't used to watching their brother when neither parent is home.*


*update My husband just told us that he'll be spending christmas with his family saying he needs to be around his dad anyway. the kids said they will just go to their dad since they and my husband are still not talking. neither of the kids are happy with how things turned out. so I feel like things have gotten out of hand and the problem got bigger. He's now choosing to basically abandon us on christmas and also keep our son away from me and his siblings.*",24716,zbguxp,"Just to add, the 3yo is your son too.

AITA for saying I won’t coddle my infertile sister any more?,"My sister “Julie” has tried to have a baby for 5 years. She had a miscarriage 2 years ago and outside that, has been unable to get pregnant. My heart hurts for her. However, one thing I don’t agree with is how my family has handled it. We’re not allowed to talk about babies around Julie. Any kids younger than 3 can’t come to family events that she’ll attend. She won’t attend baby showers, baptisms, etc. The last one I understand, but the rest feels overkill. 

I got pregnant last year. I told Julie first and she reiterated her boundaries. I said I understood. The first hurdle came with my baby shower. My MIL was throwing it. I didn’t expect Julie to come. Then my mom told me I shouldn’t have one period, “out of respect”. I said that was ridiculous. She didn’t have to come so what did it matter? Only 3 people from my side of the family came to the shower.

When my son was born, I posted a birth announcement on Facebook. My parents lectured me for this and said it was going to hurt Julie. I said she could just block or mute me. They said I should make the effort. Julie echoed that if I cared, I’d stop. I ended up blocking her just to save drama. 

My aunt’s 70th birthday party is next week. My husband and I planned to go, bringing our son. Julie called and asked if we were going. She then asked for me to get a sitter for our son. I said no. She doesn’t want to miss the party. My aunt is one of the few people who agree that Julie’s boundaries aren’t fair and wants my son there, as she doesn’t get to see him often. Julie got upset and started crying, saying that I was unfair. 

I finally snapped and asked what would happen when she got pregnant? Would we all be expected to shower her with the love and attention she’s refused to give other people’s kids? Will her baby be allowed to attend events? She said that was different. I said no, I’m not coddling her anymore. My son exists, he’s family and he’s coming. She can decide if she wants to or not.

My parents yelled at me for being mean to Julie. They offered to pay for a sitter but I said no. It’s not even her house. AITA?",24706,xcj282,"NTA

Good lord. Wow. She's trying to cut off all family event related contact for your side of the family?

She needs therapy badly. That's just so unfair to you and your child and the other relatives who do want to see the baby.

AITA for telling my ex his lack of money is not my issue?,"I (36F) have a daughter Sadie (12) with my ex-husband John (39). We got divorced 5 years ago and I have primary custody while he sees her two weekends a month. Last year, he got married to Amanda who has sole custody of her kids (10&8F) from a previous marriage. Amanda is a SAHM (not for any health reasons or so on, she just doesn't want to work) while John works at a 9 to 5. He makes good money to support them, but not enough to live in luxury.

I have a much higher-paying job. Since it's just me and Sadie,  I make sure she has the best possible life. She goes to a private school, set her up a college fund, and she has much better things than most kids (phone, clothes, etc). I still managed to raise her to be humble and not take things for granted, and she's one of the hardest working people I know, always making sure to get good grades and keep her room tidy. 

Well, the last few times she came back after a weekend at John's, I noticed that the clothes she was bringing back in her duffel are a) not her size and b) much cheaper and poorer quality than what I usually buy for her. I asked her why that is and she told me that while she's at her dad's, Amanda takes away her nice clothes and gives them to her kids while Sadie gets the clothes they buy from Target. I asked her if she wanted them back but she said she didn't mind sharing since all her favourite clothes were kept here.

The problem came when I went to pick her up last weekend.I had a business meeting and couldn't drive her over, so Amanda offered to just pick Sadie up from school, which hadn't happened before. When I got there on Sunday, John and Amanda asked me to sit down with them and when Sadie came to hug me, Amanda sent her to her room quite harshly saying her punishment wasn't over yet. I was confused because Sadie very rarely misbehaves.

They sat me down in the kitchen and said that it was unfair for Sadie to be going to a private school while her kids go to a public one, so they'd decided that Sadie would be pulled out of private school and put in the same school as the girls. They also said I should keep up Sadie's punishment because when they told her she blew up at them, told them it wasn't fair, and yelled that Amanda and her kids weren't even her real family, that all they did was steal.

I told them in no uncertain terms to fuck off. I would not be pulling my child out of a school she likes, away from her friends, because they can't afford it. I told them they could easily make as much money as me if Amanda started working in her field because she has the qualifications and the job market is very good. I told them their money problems are not my issue, and if Sadie's items get stolen again or they try to pull her out of school, I'll be taking this to court.

They've been blowing up my phone ever since, calling me a selfish AH, and after telling the story to a friend, he told me I was rubbing my success in their face, but I still don't feel like I did anything wrong. Still, AITA?

EDIT: I got temporary guardianship while waiting for a court hearing. We're going to try to get full custody and have John get one day a week of visitation, supervised for at least the first few months, and no contact with Amanda or her kids.This way, he still sees Sadie just as much and they can try to repair their relationship, but she doesn't have to go back there. All contact between us is made through emails which are CC'ed by my lawyer, and I've asked for Sadie's things back. I've talked to Sadie and we've decided that she's going to try therapy for a little while to help deal with everything that's happened.

UPDATE: We've had the hearing and our custody arrangement's been modified. Any and all decisions relating to Sadie are made by me, and me alone. John has supervised visitation once a week, and Sadie will continue in therapy to deal with all the issues Amanda and co. have caused her. 

They tried to push for 50/50 custody split on grounds of alienation (so me trying to put Sadie against her father), but we made it clear from the start that we wanted to keep Amanda and her children away, and wanted supervision only because we don't feel safe leaving him alone as of yet, but that we were open to modifications. Thanks to that, the proof of stealing, and Sadie's therapist's testimony, their claim was thrown out pretty quickly. 

Amanda's pissed, and has tried to contact me and Sadie, but I made it clear to her that if she keeps harrassing me or my daughter, I'll have to make this known to the authorities. Sadie and I have blocked her everywhere, and any communication between John and us is made through text messages or emails only. 

I'd like to thank you all for your support throughout all of this, it really means a lot to us. Sending you loads of love!",24698,wa9h2l,NTA - And I would make the school aware that any decisions about your daughter need to go through you so he doesn't just do it behind your back,25332,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wa9h2l/aita_for_telling_my_ex_his_lack_of_money_is_not/
AITA? For cutting my niece off college fund because of what she said about me.,"
I'm just going to be direct and quick. 

I (M35) have 2 sisters that I'm close with, I also have a niece (Leah), Leah's 16 and after my ex wife decided to split up and divorce due to inferitility problems that lasted for 5 years. I started a college fund for Leah to help her go to her chosen college. That was in 2019 

Now I visit my mother's home (where my sister and Leah are living) every week to spend the weekend together. 

This past weekend I was asleep upstairs while my mother, my sister and Leah were in the kitchen. I came downstairs to grab a glass of water and heard my sister talking about my ex wife expecting a baby with her new husband. This struck a nerve and I kind of froze from shock. I then heard Leah react to the news repeatedly saying ""I told you so I told you so"" then explained she's always thought that I was the one with a problem for not being able to have a baby with my ex, but that I was too ""afraid"" to admit due to fragile masculinity. I could not believe what she said but what made it worse is her following statement about how my ex was smart to get a divorce before it was too late. I went upstairs and into the room and shut the door and stayed there for hours. 

Mom and sister saw me about to leave and insisted to know what the problem was. I didn't want to argue but I told them that I heard what Leah said about me. Leah stopped eating and got quiet. My sister tried to play dumb but I told her I heard their entire conversation about my ex wife and her pregnancy news. My sister tried to backpaddle saying Leah is just a kid who doesn't know much about this stuff and was just ""spouting nonesense"". I told them I don't wanna talk about it and they refused to let me leave but I left eventually.


I later sent my sister a text telling her about how hurt and devastated I was because of what Leah said, and told her I will no longer be responsible for funding her education. My sister kept trying to call then texted saying Leah didn't mean what she said and offered to make her apologize but I didn't feel comfortable being in the same room with someone who, blamed me for something that was out of my control and, something that literally turned my life upside down. 

My mother tried to get me to come over so we could talk saying Leah doesn't deseve me turning my back on her like that.


ETA So this went off unexpectedly, I read a lot of insightful comments but couldn't keep up (I'm sorry). I haven't seen my sister nor Leah after what happened. but they are still trying to contact me, which means there's still a room for a discussion and so I've decided to go see them tomorrow, sit down together and have a long conversation but this. Now I admit I'm not the type of person that feels comfortable talking about what's bothering me. especially when it comes to sensitive topics, but like some of you have said, this is my family, my niece and her future. I admit that I was mad when I told my sister about the college fund cancelation, I love Leah so much and see her as my own daughter. Unfortunately her dad, my BIL is deceased and so I understand losing a parent at a young age and relate to the kind of hurt she carries inside ( lost my father in an accident when I was 11) And I think that...sitting down and talking things out is the best option before I make any decision. Hopefully this will get resolved soon and I'm so sorry for the long ETA but I just wanted to let you guys know. I might update on what happens after we talk so we'll see how it goes.


Thank you so much for bearing with me. Also, one more thing to clarify, both my ex wife and I were having these fertility issues, both sides but since my ex wife got pregnant soon after her new marriage then my family thought that I was the problem ""originally"". It is what it is and I'm learning to not words get in my head so easily. I'm not mad at anyone, I'm just trying to move on with my life like anybody else.",24692,uq4hu3,"NTA, they let her sit there and have an adult conversation, but want to call her a child when they are consequences of that conversation. You're not responsible for paying for her education. And you're only 35, it's possible that you can find someone else and have your own child. So save that money for your own potential future child. 

And your sister has a lot of nerve, if the girl doesn't want to take it upon herself to apologize, a forced apology from her is not going to mean a damn thing.

I'm childless and my brother has two daughters, and I like to send them stuff and contribute to their college funds, but it's only because I choose to, I am not obligated to. They have two parents with jobs who can help contribute to their education and other extracurriculars.

AITA for refusing to give this woman her grandma's wedding dress and jewelry back?,"I(26F) bought a hoarder house back in May 2018. It is a big 6 bedroom 4 and a half bathroom house.

When I bought it, the contract stated that I take ownership of the house and everything in it. The lady who owned it died, and her heirs could not deal with the stench and literal mountain of junk and waste in it (you could only open the door not even 8"", and some rooms had the junk filling them wall to wall and floor to ceiling).

Well it took me these last 4 years to finish cleaning, fixing and updating it. While doing the cleaning I made sure to check everything before throwing it out. Ended with more than $20k of money, some nice jewelry and antique furniture, and finally a stunning 40s style, lace covered wedding dress. This woman took care of that dress untill she couldn't anymore, and it took just some minor work to restore it.

I currently don't have a partner, but I decided that it would he the dress I will be wearing if I ever get married.

While doing the cleaning, I reached to the heirs to pass on some pictures and momentos (Christmas personalized ornaments, some kid artwork...), and because of that, I had one of them (30s F) in my FB friends list.

After repairing the dress, I put it on with the jewelry and posted a pic on FB. Well this woman saw it and asked for the dress and heirlooms back.

I refused to give them back, and legally they can't do anything. Also if they meant that much to them, they should have cleaned the house on their own, not sell it to me.

The rest of the apartment was so full of crap that my 5 foot 2 inch sister had to stoop to walk into the apartment.  You couldn't even get to the bathroom. They were using grocery bags and soda bottles as toilets. We know because they hoarded these too.

AITA for showing my missing eye to the new teacher after he told me my bangs are disrespectful?,"I had an accident when I was a baby and I lost my left eye. I don't have an eye socket I could put a fake eye in, it's just normal skin and some scars on a big pach of my face (they reconstructed my face with a later surgery this way). The right side and the bottom half of my face is completely normal. 

I have big side bangs that hide the left side of my face so I don't freak anyone out and I don't get weird looks. I've been going to the same school since I was 5, so the teachers and the kids know about it. 

We got a new teacher this week. He started by asking us to go around and introduce ourself. When it got to me, he was rude and asked me ""do your parents know you come to school looking like this? It's extremely disrespectful, fix your bangs, I want to see your face!"" 

So I obeyed and tucked my bangs behind my ear, showing the left side of my face. He gasped, his face turned red, my classmates laughed and he told me that I can let my bangs down. 

Later that day, my head teacher came to me to scold me. She told me I was wrong to ""shock"" the new teacher and I should've just told him about it.

AITA for telling a family to fly private?,"I was recently flying from NYC to LAX for a work trip and I had the displeasure of sitting next to a family and a little boy (9). I got on the plane in the midst of issues with my diabetes and I needed to eat within two hours so I began snacking. I immediately began receiving dirty looks from the parents and the mother said “can you not do that? Our son.” so I put my food away and figured I’d wait until the flight attendant came around so I could buy food from her and eat at an acceptable time just to show some respect for their wishes.  

So the flight attendant comes by with her beverages and snacks, I start to ask for a Coke and a snack box, but before I can finish the sentence the father says “nothing for this row, we’re all set here” and she continues on. I go up to press the call light so I can get my food and my drink because I actually need it and the father says “our son has prader-willi, we’d prefer it if you didn’t eat because it causes tantrums when he doesn’t know he can’t eat and he’s always hungry”. I’m close to a tantrum myself at this point and so I look him in the eye and say “I do not care, fly private if you want to control your surroundings”. 

The flight attendant comes back and I get my food and my drink, I snarf it down and chug my soda, and I sit back. As soon as I’m calmed and I’m able to open my laptop and get back to work the mother leans in and says “I feel a calling to educate you about my son’s disease” and I felt my entire body clench up. She keeps talking to me and explaining how I’d made her son feel and I said “listen lady, I don’t fucking care, I’m going to handle my T1D the way I see fit and you’re going to handle your son the way you see fit. I’m not endangering myself because you don’t want to deal with a tantrum, if you want to control other people then you book all the seats in a row or you fucking fly private.”

AITA for refusing to to let my husband's infertile friend name our son?,"

My husband (m33)s best friend (m37) Will is infertile. He got divorced 2 times because of it and because he lied and hid his infertility. And his life hasn't been the same the day he was told he can't have kids. He has always had a soft spot for children and when he found out that my husband and I are expecting, he was so thrilled and started buying us gifts and decore pieces that he made from his woodwork for the baby. My husband thinks that those are all nice gestures but I couldn't help but feel uncomfortable especially with how much he keeps mentioing the baby.


A few days ago, my husband and I found the gender of the baby. The minute we told Will, he started calling the baby a random name he picked and was going to give to his baby if he wasn't infertile. He then started begging us to use this name and my husband said it was a ""done deal"". I refused but my husband called me heartless and asked me to do this one small, nice gesture for his struggling friend to give him closure and honor him after all the things he has done for us. I flipped and said it's my baby not his. Will heard this and left immediately. My husband yelled at me saying it's his baby too and my behavior towards Will was abhorant. He left after him and didn't come back til the morning. He kept saying the same thing and pressuring me to agree on the name but I refused.

AITA for dropping him and his daughter off at a rental car place states away from home?,"Long story short: I (27f) started seeing 44yo ""Dave"" 3 years ago. I have 2 sons, 9 and 6. He has 1 daughter ""Ann"", 17. I booked a road trip for me and my sons roughly 3 months ago. A road trip consisting of roughly 26 hours worth of driving with stops in between. This is the first time I've ever been financially able to do much of anything with my children so I went all out. Planned to stop at every place they had ever asked me to go, basically. I was beyond excited to surprise them with this trip. We got home 4 nights ago.

A week before leaving my Dave decides he wants to go with me and bring Ann as a ""bonding"" experience. We do not live together and Ann has never liked me because I'm ""boring"". She has said this to my face. So Dave thinks it will be good. I didnt really want either of them to go but thought what the hell, why not. This could be good for us. Boy was I fucking wrong. From the moment Ann got in to my vehicle she started complaining about absolutely everything. It was too crowded, too loud, we were taking too many stops, the boys were ""too annoying"" and ""need to quiet the fuck down and chill out"". 

We get a hotel 9 hours in (PA). Its around 3pm at this point. Dave asks if he can take a drive with Ann because she was getting irritated with the kids. I told him he could if he makes it quick because I needed to go get dinner supplies. 3 hours later he shows back up. Him and Ann went out to eat. So I make a comment saying ""you didnt think we wanted to eat too?"" And Ann snaps back with ""I dont think we asked."" 

After comments like this for days I finally snapped. My body are now saying they just want to go home because several times Dave told my kids to be quiet because of his kids comfortability. At this point I havent done anything with my kids because the queen would have a fit if we pulled off anywhere AND Dave at this point basically refused to let me drive despite me arguing. IN MY CAR. So I snapped, told him to pull the fuck over. When he finally does, I drive to the nearest car rental and tell them to get the fuck out of my car. Dave and Ann both start flipping out. Ann saying she isnt going to get in a car that has ""bed bugs"". Dave saying he didnt want to take separate vehicles and didnt have enough money for a rental because the queen spent over $1500 in 4 days. So I say ""I dont believe I fucking asked."" And take off. They were close to 800 miles from home. It took them 4 days to get home due to lack of money and needing to borrow. I'm being told I'm a selfish cunt. AITA?",24395,tg1fhu,"NTA.

Anyways, He always go on long rants about his exes and say stuff like ""I hope you don't have this awful habit my ex has"" or ""hope you like XYZ cause my ex didn't"" and the list goes on.


I found a 2nd job recently and he's been having me pay every time we go out. When I protest he'd say he's going through a rough patch and is seeing how much help I cam offer.


Last night he invited his family to join us for dinner. We got to the restaurant first. He asked me if I ""brought"" enough momey, I said why and he told me that he told his parents that I'd pay for their meals. I said why would I and he went on about his parents going through a rough patch just like him. I said ""I'm sorry this can't be a coincidence!"" he asked what I meant and I told him that I would not be paying. He insisted, I refused and said no. He then leaned back and said ""well, you're here, so not much of a choice you have anyway"" while laughing like it was funny. I silently got up, took my phone and purse and walked right out. He was shocked he started shouting after me to stop and wait but I didn't.


I went home and he called me enraged saying that I did a horrible thing walking out on him and his parents, while I could've just paid. I told him that their unfortunate financial situation isn't my problem and that I wasn't obligated to pay for their food. If they couldn't pay for their meals, then they should not go out. He got offended and said and I qoute ""you're making money a priority just like my ex did"" then went on about how disrespectful my attitude was and how I made him look small infront of his parents and forced him to lie about why I wasn't there when they came.

We've been going back an forth about it til now. He's mad and is refusing to speak to me til I apologize. AITA? I feel bad because his parents are lovely and I been doing my best to keep a good relationship with them.",24356,xf3my2,"NTA. There’s a reason why he’s divorced. So many red flags in this post. 

1st : refusing to say divorce bc it looks like he was dumped 

2nd : treating you like a personal ATM 

3rd : wanting to make you his parents’ ATM 

Do yourself a favor and break up with him. He’s clearly a gold digger. Like seriously don’t invite your parents to eat out when u dont have money and make ur partner pay. That’s just disgusting.",1304,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xf3my2/aita_for_leaving_the_restaurant_before_my/
AITA for leaving after being told to be quiet at dinner?,"The title probably makes it sound worse than it was, but I’m still conflicted.

My (f21) boyfriend (m24) of almost a year, invited me to dinner with his family. (Mom, dad and his 16yr old brother.) Never met them prior to that. The only thing I knew about them is that they’re conservative and christians but lovely people. 

And they were. I got along really well with them, before dinner. They were lovely and talkative. When it was time for dinner, my bfs dad wanted to pray. After praying he said, something alone the lines of “let us dig and let the food keep us quiet.” This is a pretty popular saying in our country, mostly told to young children in school. My understanding of this has always been that you shouldn’t speak with food in your mouth or be extremely loud at the table. I wouldn't say its a cultural thing, though.

I dug in, took a bite. It was fish soup. Absolutely delicious. And y’know, like a good guest I wanted to compliment the cook. “This is delicious - is it saffron? A perfect autumn soup!” My bfs brother looked surprised. My bfs father hushed me. Big time. A really aggressive SHHH with a finger over his lips. And then he said, again, “Let the food keep us quiet.” I aplogised because I thought I had accidentally spoken with food in my mouth or something. But a few minutes passed and nobody said a word. Super awkward and weird, especially since they had been so talkative before. My bf was also unusually quiet. 

After a few minutes I was too weirded out and asked about their day, and how nice it was that they invited me there. And his mother did the hush thing? So awkward. I think this is when it clicked, no speaking at all at the table. Let the food keep us quiet. Really quiet. But this was a super awkward situation, and I couldn’t deal with that. Imagine sitting at a table with 5 people, everybody eating soup looking dead serious. So I laughed, it just slipped out. Ended up being told off by bfs parents that I was being disrespectful etc. and if I didn’t respect how their household worked I could eat alone in the kitchen. (We were eating in like a separate dining room.) Sooo I thanked them for the food and left to the hotel me and bf stayed at.

My boyfriend later told me that was an asshole move, that I should’ve just kept quiet or eat alone in the kitchen. I understand their family traditions and rules, but it was so weird. I just couldn't take it anymore. Was I being an asshole though?",24329,yu8tm5,I would not want to be a part of this family.,6585,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yu8tm5/aita_for_leaving_after_being_told_to_be_quiet_at/
AITA for leaving my best friend and his friends stranded in an unfamiliar city?,"So for background, my best friend has gotten into going to these Spartan races. He and a small group of his friends have started going to local ones but recently heard about one in another state they wanted to go to and compete in, but they didn't have anywhere to stay. So they asked me if they could borrow my truck and trailer (I have a tow behind camper) for the weekend. I said no, I wasn't comfortable with them taking my truck and trailer but that I'd drive them and the camper to their event. We made the three hour trip and set everything up in the area where the race was taking place the next day. 

I have a habit of leaving my keys on a hook next to the door to my bedroom in my camper. Remember this. 
Come nightfall, I went to take a phone call outside and ended up wandering around the grounds for over an hour. When I got back to the camper, the door was locked, and I was told by my best friend's older friend through the window that there wasn't enough room for me in MY trailer. So I reached for my keys to unlock the door, but realized I had left them inside the camper on the hook in my room. So I called my best friend from outside and all I was told was ""sorry bro, nothing I can do"". So I ended up sleeping in my truck that night, which I had fortunately left unlocked by accident.

Their race began at 8 am, and at 7, they came meandering out of the trailer and woke me up. No apology, by the way. 

So while they were in their race, I hooked my truck back up to the trailer, closed and locked everything, and waited until just after they finished and had started walking back to the trailer (think really wide open field). When I saw them coming, I started the truck and drove off the property. With them chasing behind. I made the three hour trip back home declining call after call. When I finally got home, I finally took my best friend's call. He started yelling at me saying ""why would you do this? We have no way home now"". I just said sorry, you shouldn't have made me sleep in my truck after I did you this solid. 

He told me that there were better ways to handle this than by leaving them in an unfamiliar city with no way home. I think he ended up calling his dad to come and get them. 

Is he right? Was there a better way to handle this? I felt justified until he said that. I am kinda doubting my decision now. 
Am I the asshole?",24298,uptyk1,NTA… who tells someone they can’t sleep in their own camper? He’s not your best friend.,10982,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uptyk1/aita_for_leaving_my_best_friend_and_his_friends/
"AITA for ""making"" my boyfriend eat fast food for a week?","My boyfriend grew up in a house that valued outdated gender norms. The women were always responsible for cooking and cleaning, so he didn't learn how to do any of that for most of his life. That is, until he moved in with me after college. 

He's been good about a few things. He doesn't mind helping with dishes or handling the laundry, but the one thing I can't seem to get him to do is learn how to cook. The only thing he can do is microwave frozen meals. I've been trying to teach him the basics, but it seems like it goes through one ear and just comes out the other. He still can't turn on the oven or use the stove without help. The toaster is too complicated for him to use he claims.  Doesn't know how to boil eggs, cook rice, or even how to measure out ingredients using cups. I just don't understand why he can't grasp this but is fine with other things. 

Here's the part where I may be an asshole. I went on a trip two weeks ago for work. I'm in charge of buying groceries (we have separate accounts) and I realized how expensive his frozen meals actually are. Three to four dollars for each. I said screw it and bought the easiest ingredients I could find for a lot cheaper for him to cook on his own. He doesn't like leftovers, so me cooking ahead for him was out. Before I left, I sat him down once again and gave him a very long lesson on using the oven, toaster, and stove, as well as how to boil/scramble eggs, toast a piece of toast, boil rice/noodles, and heat up pasta sauce. I also taught him how to pan fry things like onions and other veggies, and how to tell when they were ready. In case he didn't want to cook both lunch and dinner, I also bought things to make salads and fixings for sandwiches. 

I come back a week later, and he is angry! He claims I practically left him to starve, and how I know he has trouble cooking. I retaliate, saying I showed him what to do, and I get a whole range of excuses. ""Setting the oven/stove temp is too complicated"" ""He cut his finger chopping onions and couldn't chop any until his cut healed"" ""He only likes the salad kits so everything is balanced"" 

Apparently he only ate sandwiches, canned goods, and fast food for a week. He thinks I'm a major asshole for not telling him I'm not buying his frozen meals, and leaving him alone to fend for himself. On one hand, I do think it was shitty of me not to tell him I didn't buy his meals, and as someone who grew up in a home pretty much only boiled hotdogs and veggies, and only properly learned how to cook after moving, out I do feel for him, but at the same time, after a few months of not getting the simplest concepts, I'm left feeling partially justified in my actions. So Reddit, AITA?",24281,wk815y,"info: how can he work the microwave but can't put bread in a toaster ??

this goes beyond outdated gender norms, OP. NTA. you could've told him you didn't get his TV dinners but you sure as hell didn't leave him to fend for himself.

AITA for responding to my father’s request for a relationship with a detailed PowerPoint on why he will never be forgiven?,"If I’m the AH here, I’ll own it.  I’m not sorry, but like it would be good to know because the rest of my family thinks this went too far.

My (24F) mom died when I was 7 from leukemia. I have very few memories of her from before she was sick and I didn’t get to spend a lot of time with her in her last year but she was an artist and until she couldn’t anymore she would make me little collages when she was in the hospital with drawings and photos and messages for me. My grandmother put them all in a book for me after she died.  I wanted to be like my mom and my counselor thought it would help, so I started a journal where I would do kind of a similar thing and I’ve done at least one page a week all these years ever since my mom died, more when I miss her or have something hard going on. So, I have kind of a unique record of my mental state over the last 16 years.

My father remarried when I was 9.  My step-mother really leaned hard into the “I’m your mom now” and my father didn’t stop her.  It improved when they had my half-brother because she basically forgot about me then. Unfortunately he got cancer when he was 3. And I pretty much ceased to exist for my father, he was either working or gone with my brother and I spent all my teen years mostly at home alone or with my grandparents. The mantra was that my brother needed to be the focus because he might die so I needed to not be selfish since I was healthy. I stopped trying to talk to him when I was 16 and it was a dark time.  I moved out when I was 18 and cut them off completely.

My grandparents let me know that my brother died a couple of years ago but respected my desire to remain NC with my father. He recently reached out to them because he wants to see me and talk.  I went through my old journals and made him a PowerPoint with images of the entries where I had talked about being frustrated and feeling abandoned and unwanted, some with literal quotes of things my dad had said to me during arguments. Even the really dark stuff from when I was seriously depressed. Then I ended it with a photo of one of my mom’s collages where she had written “Remember that your dad and I are always here for you” and I wrote “You failed. Go away.” underneath. I felt like him being able to see it from my literal perspective would communicate why I don’t want him back better than I could.

Evidently it worked, but a little too well because I’ve been bombarded by family telling me that it’s understandable that I don’t want to see him, but what I sent gutted him and he’s completely fallen apart after reading through it and it was unnecessarily cruel.

Maybe it was, I know my bar for that is kind of weird sometimes, so AITA?

Edit - A couple of follow up notes, since it came up the comments:

1.  I loved my brother.  I don’t resent him.  He was a good kid and I wish he was still with us.  None of this is his fault, to me it is completely my father’s and to a lesser extent step-mother’s. The parents prevented me from spending time with him as he got sicker so I wouldn’t have been allowed to be there for him even if I had been able to (which I wasn’t towards the end because I was also struggling to stay alive).

2.  I have empathy.  I understand what my father lost, I was there.  I also lost those same people plus effectively my father.  Even so, to me there is no excuse for completely shutting your own kid completely out of your life while also preventing them from getting any kind of help.  I understand depression and freezing up, I’ve been there, and I still even not being an adult managed to consider the impact of my behavior on other people.  If he was that bad off, he should have given me up to be raised by someone else.  My mom’s parents asked and he wouldn’t agree to let me stay with them full time.  I could have had a dad that was able to occasionally tell me he loved me even if it was just a text message.  Alternatively, I could have lived with my grandparents and had people around me who cared about me every day even if that wasn’t my father.  I got neither and every request for help of any kind was met with “suck it up”.  I can empathize with having to function while breaking down inside, but I can’t empathize with what he did.

3.  I gather from relatives (who have backed off after some hard boundary setting) that my father and step-mother split not long ago and are in divorce proceedings, which is why he reached out now and why the rest of the family was upset with how I responded at the time - he wasn’t in a good place already.  I’ve told them that if they care about him to encourage him to keep away from me, refuse to pass on any messages, and try to get him into inpatient care or something if they’re that worried he’s going to do something rash.  I don’t want anything to do with him and I’ve told them that I don’t want to hear about anything that happens after this point, but the rest of his family love him so for their sake I hope he pulls himself together.",24205,zh2g3s,"NTA he failed.

AITA? For not wearing a wedding ring and making my coworker think I'm single?,"
I F30 started working at a company recently. I get along with most of my coworkers but been having some issues with this guy ""Morgan"". Morgan from what I understand is what everyone call ""the handsome"" guy in the office. He dated 2 of his coworkers and hit on several others. He seemed friendly when we talked, he seemed respectable and never asked questions outside of work.


He offered to buy me lunch and internet and kept sending me funny memes and stuff. It was nice but felt a bit too much so I asked that he stop and he did.


He started sending me pics of him that were inappropriate. I texted him saying that I'm married and he was being inappropriate. He texted saying I was lying about being married to get him off my back, then went on about how nice and attractive he is, and how I'm trying to act like I don't like him to get him to try harder. I felt frustrated especislly after he kept sendig me pics. Days ago he sent me a d&ck pic and told me to ""suck it"". I decided to let my husband deal with it. He sent him a text back saying ""sorry bud, small objects are a chocking hazard for her"". Then blocked him.

The other day he came into the office looking furious and ""confronted"" me about being misleading by not having a wedding ring on when I'm married. I said I didn't need to prove anything to anybody and didn't lead anyone on. He said he was trying to get close to me and I should've told him I'm married from the get go. I said I was sorry but he maybe he shouldn't have basically tried to enforce a relationship with anyone regradless if they're in a relationship or not. He said that my husband and I were rude and offensive then rushed out. Other coworkers said Morgan was an asshole but I too bare the blame for having my wedding ring on and being somewhat misleading. I said I don't think I owe anyone an explanation and refused to apologize for what happened just to keep the peace in the office.

AITA for calling out step-family’s dirty laundry at Thanksgiving after they criticized me for being unmarried?,"I’m still getting shit for this from my family so it’s possible I may be a bit of the AH here.

I’m 29F, the players are my mom, step-dad, and four step-siblings (35M, 37M, 40F, 42M) and their families.  I’m the black sheep in that I’m the only one not married with kids, but that’s by my preference.  I love living alone, I don’t want kids, and having a partner just isn’t that important to me.  My family has been asking me when I’m going to get a boyfriend and settle down since I was 19 and the answer has always been “ew, never”.

I was going to skip Thanksgiving, but my mom insisted that she wanted everyone home this year if possible so I went. It was the usual drill, but youngest step-brother and his wife are having another kid so that was the big announcement.  This was fine until around the end of dinner one of the SSILs asks if I’m not anxious to have kids since I’m almost 30 and time is running out.  I laughed and said “Nah, I’m good.”  That led to one of the step-brothers saying that every family needs an old maiden aunt and some other comments I didn’t appreciate. I said let’s move on, but my mom said “We’re just worried about you.”

This is where I’m possibly the AH.  I know all the family dirt so I said, “Well, I’m the only person at this table that’s not an alcoholic, a cheater, or constantly broke af because I have more kids than I can afford so I’m not the one to worry about.”

AITA for eating at the same restaurant as my husband’s family?,"I (32F) have been married to my husband (35M) for 3 years. We dated for 2 years before that. I want to start this off by saying that he really is a good guy in other areas. 

My husband’s parents, his 2 brothers (ages 38 and 40ish), and his brothers’ girlfriends/fiancées have a tradition of going out to dinner once a month. I am invited about 50% of the time. I’ve talked to my husband’s brother’s fiancée, and she says she is invited every time. 

When I say I’m not invited, I mean that my husband tells me “I’m going to the family dinner. It’s probably best if you sit this one out.” When I expressed that I wanted to come, he told me that it would be for the best if I didn’t. It has caused several fights.

About a week ago, my husband went to a family dinner that I wasn’t invited to. I was very pissed. So earlier that day, I called and made a reservation at the restaurant they were going to. My husband left the house, not knowing about my reservations, and I left 15 minutes after him. 

I ended up seated at a table where I couldn’t see his family. So I got up as if I was going to the bathroom and walked right past them. They were all there, including his brothers’ SOs. My husband looked completely shocked and asked me what I was doing there. I told him that I had just been dying for a steak, so I came and got one at the restaurant. 

My mother in law said it was very rude of me to interrupt their family dinner. I pointed out that I wasn’t trying to join them, I was just going to the bathroom. I told them to have a good meal and I left. I went and finished my steak by myself.

My husband was really pissed when he came home, and he told me that he couldn’t believe how much of an asshole I had been. I said that he was an asshole for not inviting me to his dinners when his brothers’ SOs got to go. My husband said that the decision to invite was between him and his family, and I should respect it.

AITA for getting mad at my husband because he laughed when I told him to reheat his own dinner?,"

For context_ I'm a sahm with 2 kids (3yrs old & 6months old) My husband is an ambulance driver, he works odd hours and comes home unexpectedly, he expects dinner or lunch ready whenever he gets home, whether I'm sleeping or busy with the kids. It's exhausting but do it because I know how hard he works.

After struggling with this for long, my mom suggested that I start pre-making meals so that dinner or lunch can be ready when he's home, all he's gotta do is just reheat it. I immediately got to it and went grocery shopping and spent an entire 2 days making meals and storing them in the fridge. His response to this idea is ""whatever"". I was sort of relieved cause now I could sleep properly, the kids care won't get interrupted etc.


Well, at 11pm last night, he comes home while I'm sleeping after putting the baby to sleep. I wake up to him shouting for me from the livingroom. I rush out and ask what was happening and he tells me he's hungry and wants dinner. I tell him it's in the fridge and just needs to be reheated and he didn't have to wake me up for it. He tells me I need to go reheat it for him. I say no, not happening and he needs to reheat his own dinner. He starts laughing sarcastically which got me mad. He then tells me I'm ridiculous to assume that after working no stop for an entire shift that he should be ""expected"" to do a chore aka reheat dinner himself, when I'm here and I can do it. I start arguing with him after he complains I'm not doing enough and refuse to reheat it then I go back inside the bedroom and shut the door.

He comes an hour later yelling about how I've basically made him almost pass out from hunger just cause I'm petty trying to prove a point, I tell him he's being unreasonable to expect me to reheat his dinner when he could do it himself. He gives me a nasty look then tells me he's going to bed hungry and I'm responsible for this then heads out. This morning he silently gets dressed and leaves while turning his phone off.",24044,tikg9a,"NTA and I’m so upset and angry on your behalf. 6 months means no sleep and broken nights, still being milk on tap, no clothes fitting still, and wild hormones. A 3 year old means getting no rest during the day even when the baby sleeps because 3 year olds +do not stop+. Both together means no privacy, no space, constant touch, constant shouting, and complete exhaustion. You’re doing amazingly to do what you have.

He is unreasonable. Utterly. This is not fair, healthy or good behaviour. It is utterly dismissive of what you’re doing, shows no care or consideration towards you and is completely selfish.

Depending on your relationship you could try and talk to him about how tired you are, what you do because he might not realise. If you’re more of a “show don’t tell” and can trust him to pull his finger out, go away for a weekend without the kids when he’s off so he can feel what it’s like and then have a talk. If neither of these are possible, then take the children and go and stay with your mother (or another family member) if possible. That’ll give you some space to work out what you want, and someone to help you so you’re not alone.

AITA for getting mad at my mum for making my girlfriend sleep on the floor?,"Throwaway.

My girlfriend, “Rose,” and I have been together for 4 years and she is 5 months pregnant with our first child. My mum seemed to really like Rose (or at the very least tolerated her) - but after we announced that we were expecting, something definitely switched in her. 

She has become extremely rude and disrespectful towards my girlfriend. She makes passive-aggressive comments at every chance she gets. I’ve had to take a step back from my mother until she fixes her behaviour.

Rose had gone to visit her family who lives far out of town. It was a very last-minute trip, and she drove herself to the destination and back. Unfortunately, at around 6pm, her car broke down and she was forced to pull over. Fortunately, my brother, “Chris,” who’s great with cars and lives about an hour and ½ from where Rose was stranded, was willing to pick her up and sorted everything out. I was out of the country, so I’m grateful that my brother sorted everything out for her.

Chris moved back in with my mum about a year ago. Obviously, the situation wasn’t the best, especially considering the tension between Rose and my mom that exists for no particular reason, but I hoped my mum could put her pettiness aside for at least a night.

It was too late for Chris to drive Rose back home, so my brother told her that he would drive her back tomorrow morning. An arrangement that my mum seems to not like, but one that she managed to keep her mouth shut about (my girlfriend tells me)

Rose helps prepare dinner, wash up, and actually engage in a decent conversation with my mum for the first time in ages. However, they mostly avoid each other. Chris goes to bed earlier, leaving my mum and Rose.

My mum lives in a two-bedroom apartment and since both bedrooms were taken. Rose assumed that she would be sleeping on the couch.

She apparently assumed wrong.

My mum gives Rose the thinnest blanket ever and basically screams at her, telling her that she has to sleep on the floor to not “ruin her couch.” She tells Rose to “make do,” with the pillows on the couch and the blanket that provides zero warmth. 

Rose thought about protesting, but ultimately decided against it. According to Rose, my mum kept opening her door to check if she was sleeping on the couch, so she couldn’t even try to sleep on the couch.

At 5am, Chris found Rose on the couch and let her sleep on his bed. He ended up telling me, but told me to not make a “big fuss out of it.”

I did the exact opposite.

AITA for exposing my ex to his mother about our kids?,"I (45f) am currently divorced from my ex Thomas (47m) of 30years.  We ended up seeing a lawyer to help with dividing stuff. Everything was pretty much wrapped up till he said he no longer wanted any part of our kids' lives (5m) and (12f). I didn't argue with him about it since I already know what it's like having a parent who doesn't want you around or wants to be in your life. I asked what he wanted me to tell the kids and he just said ""whatever you think is best I don't care. I don't want to parent anymore."" Everything was in agreement and signed with no fuss.

A few weeks later I get a call from my ex Mil asking if we could meet each other. When I came over she broke down crying and begging to let my ex see his kids again. I was confused about what she meant because not once did he contact me after meeting the lawyer. She went on about how my ex said ""he really missed them and that I was just a petty b*tch for taking full custody."" Also that he was crying for days about it. I told her my version of events and she called it bs saying her son wouldn't lie like that especially not about his kids. Then I decided to call him in front of her. He didn't know she and I were meeting that day.

I said ""hey (5m) has a soccer game in a few days (which he did) and I was wondering if you wanted to go? I know he'd really love it and be happy to see you."" He instantly said ""No. I already said I'm not doing this anymore."" I raised my voice a bit saying ""well what about holidays and birthdays because we never discussed any of it and your family might want to see them."" He just said "" my family already thinks the kids aren't mine anyways so it doesn't matter."" I asked""well how do you think this is going to effect Denise (his mom)? She is over the moon about them."" He just said "" She loves me more than the kids so I doubt this will be an issue for her."" After a bit more talking we finally hung up. Ex Mil was straight faced and nodded at everything that just happened saying ""mmm okay."" She asked me to leave and said we would be in touch.

Later that day I got a call from my ex saying how it's my fault he was kicked out of his mom's house and possibly will be taken off her will. Also that none of his family members will talk to him because of what ex Mil heard. He threw a lot of insults at me before I hung up and now him and his mates keep calling and texting me. My friend is saying I shouldn't have said anything in the first place and I ruined his life.

Edition: hello thank you for your support and the gold reward. Yes, I plan to let Denise see the kids because I know she just wants to give them the world along with the rest of his family. (I was honestly confused with what op meant at first and my daughter told me overpowered like in anime but my sister clarified.)

2nd edition: hello again, I want to address something because this keeps coming up and I can't keep up with everyone. Due to actions he and I took when we were younger my Christian parents thought it would be best he and I be married at the time.",23923,u9od79,"NTA. He made a decision for which he knew his family would judge him negatively, so he lied and made you the scapegoat. You didn’t go seeking out his family to tell them what he’d done, you were blindsided by the whole thing. No way were you obligated to carry that water for him. Not at all. I can’t understand how anyone would ever take his side in this. He abandoned his children, blamed you, and now is angry that his malfeasance and subsequent lies have been found out. If I were you, I’d reach out to ex-MIL and see if she would be interested in seeing the kids and maybe having a relationship with her (unless there are toxic things about her you haven’t included).

"AITA for insisting that my boyfriend pay me for breaking my $3,500 model ship?","
My F/33 Dad passed away and left me one of his last and favorite ship model, I had it on display in my living room. but for some reason I never actually mentioned it to my boyfriend M/37 of 6 months. Maybe because we don't live together and he don't visit often.


The other day he and his friends came over to my place to celebrate his birthday. They got drunk and started throwing the sofas pillows at each others. I told them to stop then went into the kitchen to clean up.

I then started hearing loud noise, I walked out the kitchen and saw my model ship in my boyfriend's hands. I rushed to get it but he passed it on to his friend, and then his friend passed it on to the other friend.

I started running around trying to catch it while yelling at them to stop then my boyfriend grabbed it again. I was so angry I told him to hand it over but he said I needed to kiss him first. I yelled at him and he tried to threw it to his friend who tried to catch it but it missee and hit the wall and broke.

I lost it!! kicked all of his friend out then had a fight with him telling him this was a sentimental item from dad and demanded that he pay me $3,500 because this is how much it costs. He left then called in the morning asking if I was serious about wanting him to pay $3,500 and I said I was dead serious. He started making excuses saying he was drunk and also, I never told him about this ship and how important it was for me before both monetarily and sentimentally so that's on me. we had another fight and then I hung up upon telling him I'm expecting the 3,500 and that I wasn't afraid to take the legal route if I have to. He kept texting asking me to let it go and saying it was cruel of me to threaten him with the law. he had his friends apologize thinking this would be it but I insisted that he pay me.

AITA for leaving my inlaws christmas dinner after I found out that they didn't make accommodations for me?,"



I got invited to my fiance's family christmas celebratory dinner. It's my first christmas with them. I have always been picky about what I eat. Can't help it and it has to do with psychological factors, childhood, and personal likes and dislikes. Before accepting their invite I let FMIL know that I wouldn't be eating the traditional food at their celebration, and showed her a variety of dishes to choose from to accommodate me. She refused and told me to bring my own dish. I said if I had to bring my own dish when I'm a guest then I better stay at home then. We went back and forth and I insisted I wouldn't come if accommodations weren't being made. I just thought it was a simple request and FMIL could've agreed if she really wanted me there. My fiance agreed that I shhould bring my own dish but I didn't.


When we arrived there and I saw that no accommodations were made I got up, go my things and walked out and went home. My FMIL and fiance were shocked. I got tons of calls and texts from them both and my fiance came home lashing out calling me selfish and spoiled to walk out like that over a dish that his mom didn't have to make for me. and, that it was my responsibilty to feed myself. How is it my responsibilty to feed myself when I'm a guest? Makes no sense to me. I told him this and he accused me of starting shit and ruining my first christmas with his family and disrespecting his mom.



Now he's continuelly saying I fucked up and should've sucked it up for the family's sake.


ETA to clear few points:


* For those saying I have no respect for my inlaws. I do, especially FMIL. I respect her but this is so far the biggest conflict we had.


* I work long hours even on holidays so not much time to cook.


* I wasn't asking for an elaborated dish or several dishes. Just one simple option.",23850,zybgw7,YTA. Holy entitled. Pretty sure you don't need to address her as FMIL.

AITA for wanting to tell my brother's fiancée about the tracking app he secretly installed in the new phone he bought for her?,"

Pretty much the title, My f22 brother m27 is currently engaged to his fiancèe f25. he bought he a new phone for valentine's and asked my boyfriend who's trained in computer and software to install a hidden tracking app on the phone so his fianceè won't see it or notice. I overheard them talking and when I entered the room they went silent. I waited til my brother left then talked to my boyfriend, he denied having this conversation with my brother first then, admitted to installing the app on the phone. I told him he and my brother were in the wrong because this is huge breach of privacy. he said he has nothing to do with it and advised me to stay out of it as well. but I said I want to tell my brother's fiancèe. my boyfriend argued with me about being nosy and intrusive and told me to stay out of it and let them deal with their own issues. But I thought that was unfair to my future sister in law since she's the one working, paying bills and rent and this is how she is treated? My boyfriend told me gtfo with this attitude and again, said I should stay of it because it does not in any way concern me. I don't know I feel horrible after hearing about what my brother did and since I have a good relationship with his fiancee I can't help but feel guilty and wanting to tell her.

AITA for sitting on my husband's lap during Thanksgiving dinner because all chairs at the table were taken?,"


I (f, 28) have been with my husband ""Shaun"" (m, 33) for 2 years, Married for 5 months. Most of his family are decent people but his mom can be a little of a passive-aggressive and tends to criticize me a lot. Shaun sees it as ""her still not getting used to me being around"" but IDK because she treats his ex ""Julissa"" good. MIL says that Julissa has been around the family for age and her past with Shaun never affected her relationship with her. Fine, I never minded her attending every holiday and being around til yesterday.


We had Thanksgiving dinner at my MIL's house. Shaun went there before me and when I arrived it was already dinner time. Everyone was seated and I saw that all chairs were taken. I asked MIL why she didn't save me a seat and she said ""sorry"" and that one of her granddaughters decided to show up last minute and the chair was taken. I looked at her then at Julissa who was sitting next to shaun and tried to point out how I was more deserving of her chair since I'm the DIL (I know shouldn't have said it I know..I know) MIL flatout said that Julissa is as much FAMILY as me, and that it was rude to imply otherwise. Julissa was nodding confidently while glancing at me. I was so upset I wanted to leave but decided to just sit on my husband's lap and act as casual as possible. I sat on his lap asking if he was okay with it (don't worry I'm petite, he's strong built) and started eating so casually while smiling and complimenting the food and mentioning to Shaun how warm and comfortable his lap was now and then. The table went awkwardly silence. BIL would try to break the silence and change the subject but it somehow goes back to being awkward. MIL AND Julissa were barely eating and were staring at each other than at me eyes wide open.


Minutes later, Julissa excused herself to the bathroom and so did MIL. It was still awkward but I did my best to focus on dinner. Shaun was eating as well. Later, there was just so much tension and MIL was barely able to speak after Julissa left (early, like right after dinner). Shaun and I went home and MIL tried calling but then called Shaun and texted me saying what I did was inappropriate and that I ruined Thanksgiving dinner and made it awkward. She said it wasn't her fault chairs were taken and I could've dragged a chair from the kitchen but acted childishly and made Julissa (and family) uncomfortable with how inappropriate I was.


EDIT: I need to mention that even if I took a chair from the kitchen. There was not enough space at dinner table to fit the chair. Everyone was sitting next to each other.",23844,z55m2b,INFO: Why did your husband not notice there was no chair for you until you showed up? Did he just forget you existed??

AITA for evicting my sister and her daughters after the hid my wife's wig and embarrassed her?,"
First of, I want to start by mentioning that my wife is a cancer patient, She unfortunately started losing her hair due to chemo therapy and she's been incredibly insecure about it, her lack of hair in particular. She got a wig and started wearing it, I don't mind it, I 100% support her since she only wears it around family and friends.

My sister lost her apartment after a messy divorce and moved in with her twin daughters (16) almost a month ago. Things been going well except my nieces constant remarks about my wife's wig. They got so hung up on it and kept asking lots of questions about it. They asked to take turns to try it on, suggested they ""strighten"" it with the strightner and so on which was exhausting. They even pressured to see her without it but my wife was uncomfortable and refused.


Yesterday I got home and found that my wife was locking herself in the bedroom and crying. I asked what happened, She told me she woke up and didn't find her wig, then discovered my nieces took it and hid then urged her to come out so they could see her without it. My wife repeatedly asked them to give it back but they started laughing and recording , my wife got had to lock the door to keep a distance cause they didn't stop. I was fuming I went into the kitchen and confronted them, they acted confused but I was able to get the wig back. I lashed out telling them they humiliated my wife and barrassed her by taking away her wig. They said it was just lighthearted prank which made me go off on them. My sister got involved and said my wife was just being too sensitive and the girls were just curios to see her without a wig but she overreacted. I told her her daughters were recording her! She saw nothing wrong in it and said I overreacted as well. I lost it on her too and told her she and my nieces are no longer welcome to stay at my home and they needed to leave. I later let them know about the eviction since they thought I wasn't serious and they started crying begging that I let it go. But my wife is no longer comfortable around them after what they did.
My sister called our eldery dad and he begged that I let them stay and insisted my nieces were just acting like typical teenagers. He offered to speak to my wife but I declined.

AITA for scolding my struggling sister when she gives us grief about adopting a baby?,"My sister (35f) and her husband (37m) have been struggling with infertility since they got married 12 years ago. They've tried absolutely everything, from medical to spiritual, but unfortunately, nothing works. Now that she's approaching late 30s, they're starting to look into adoption, but it's also been a slow going, since their financial condition isn't exactly stable from multiple rounds of fertility treatments they went through. I can only imagine the struggle, and I sympathize with her, but the stress this situation is bringing her and her husband honestly puts a strain on our relationship.

My husband and I (both 30) lost our best friends, Mason and his wife, Kate, two weeks ago in a horrible car accident. They left behind their son Pete, who isn't even two yet. It was so sudden and so heart-wrenching. We're still grieving, which lowers out contact with a lot of people, including my sister and BIL. Our main concern right now is ourselves and Pete, whose custody has come to us because we're both his godparents, actively engaged in Pete's life since his birth, and because Mason and Kate have neither left a Will nor have immediate living relatives who can take him in.

We've decided to adopt Pete as soon as we can stomach the process. My husband and I never planned on having kids, and even if we did, this is absolutely not the way we want to go about it. The situation is far from ideal, but we're starting the adoption process yesterday, for Pete's safety if nothing else. We broke the news to our extended families and friends, letting them know that my husband and I won't be very available for a little longer because of this.

I know my sister and BIL will have something to say about this. I'm prepared for a few heated text messages or voice mails. However, I didn't expect them to turn up on our doorstep, crying about how ""unfair"" it is that we were given everything they wanted, and how we didn't deserve to be parents because we didn't go through what they had to. I've never seen my husband so angry before. He's usually very mild and gentle, but recent events have stretched our patience to the limits. We kicked them off of our porch, and I told my sister before she left that since our pain inconveniences her so much, I won't have her around me and my family at all anymore.

I know she made a fuss about it, and now everyone has something to say to us. We turned off our phones, so we don't know which ones are cursing us and which one aren't. I know some did/are. My husband and I are both in pain and grieving, and we can't trust ourselves to be objective. Did we go to far?

Edit: I originally did not want to put this information in, because I don't want everyone to point at it and say this is the reason we're not in the wrong. For the sake of disclosure: My husband and I are both men. No, this is not a case of homophobia. My sister, for all her fault, was the first person to accept me for who I love, and I will not hear a single word about this in the comment. ",23812,tnj5jr,"NTA

I'm sorry but that's just disgusting behavior from your sister. You got everything you wanted???

AITA for leaving the restaurant after my bf refused to pay for my meal?,"I had lent my bf some money few weeks ago because of something he needed and he promised to pay me back asap.

He was supposed to pay me back 5 days ago but something came up and he didn't. I tried to be patient.

Yesterday we had planned to go out with some friends at night for dinner. Yesterday after I came back from work I was robbed in the bus and I had all my money and cards stolen. I cancelled my cards but the bank customer service  told me my new card with my new details (both physical card and the digital details for apple pay) would be available the following morning because the banks were closed that afternoon. So I had no money.

When we went to dinner with my bf and friends I told my bf if he could just pay me back the money or at least pay for my meal since I have no money. He didn't exactly say yes or no, just a simple ""don't worry"". As we ordered he only ordered for himself and told me that he can't cover for mine at the moment so I better not order anything and just have some bites from his meal.

I was so mad and frustrated because he had promised to give me back the money, he then claimed something came up and couldn't give them back but then ordered a nice meal for himself and just told me to get his scraps because he wouldn't pay me back or at least for my meal. I'd be the only one sitting there with no meal in front of me. I said this is ridiculous and I got up and left.

UPDATE AITA for kicking my brother and his family out after his son stole my engagement ring?,"My [OG Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tzyzd1/aita_for_kicking_my_brother_and_his_family_out/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

So many of you have asked nonstop for an update, sorry it took me a while to log back on but lots of stuff have been going on. 

Yes I found the ring!! It was a stressful day doing a deeper search in my house trying to think like my nephew and looking in places where I think he’d hide something if he really didn’t want it to be found. And the decision was if it really wasn’t found and my brother wasn’t able to get him to talk, or they wouldn’t be able to pay back what I’m owed then the police would get involved. He did beg me not to but I told him then you better pray I find it or you come up with the money to pay me for it. 

Guess both our prayers worked because guess where I found it? In the freaking sink. The SINK. And that’s thanks to the comments who told me to look in those places. Idk what I would’ve done otherwise. It was the sink that was in their guest room, I’m glad he didn’t just throw it away. 

You guys don’t know how freaking relieved I was to find it. Took some work to remove the p trap under the sink to get it out but I was just so happy to find it!! Same night my girlfriend (fiancée 😉) got back I proposed to her and she said yes!! After a nice romantic dinner just the two of us at home…
The plan was to wait but after all this shit I thought fuck it I’m proposing ASAP before anything else happens 😅🤣

After my brother heard about me finding the ring he thought this meant they could come back. I said no. He wanted to argue about this again. All I told him was he’s lucky I haven’t gone to the cops since there was already video evidence of his son taking the ring and there’s no way I’m letting them back in when my nephew wouldn’t even say what he did with the ring. I talked with my nephew myself after I found the ring but he just said he didn’t want to tell anyone because then I’d be mad at him for hiding it. Honestly I just don’t have the energy for them anymore, his problem is their problem and hopefully they get him help before it’s too late. 

Only thing important to me is my fiancée and I starting our lives and planning our wedding 😁 Thank you Reddit for your help!! Seriously you guys were my life savers 😅

Edit to add: I just received this news after already submitting my post for approval and just wanted to add because I’m so happy, but girlfriend also informed me she’s pregnant!!! 😆😆 She found out while she was on her trip and was waiting for a good time to tell me.

My husband invited his new coworkers over for dinner. When they arrived he introduced me by gesturing at me and saying ""this is mrs Smith (didn't even say my name)...the housewife!"".

I looked at him for a second then I started laughing hysterically. I then told said ""no honey I work full time and YES I still act like a housewife when I'm home because you simply can't bother to help"". His co workers were staring at him as he tried to laugh and change the subject and ask what they wanted to drink.

Dinner went super awkward with him giving me looks and stares.

AITA for demanding my husband to pay me the $1000 dollars he spent behind my back?,"My husband (33) and I (31) used to have a 2 income home but in 2020 we've lost our home and one of our incomes (his). We moved into a smaller apartment, had to sell many things and give up most of our ""costly"" habits.

My husband has an expensive habit of going to the spa for a weekly massage session. we live in an urban area so this stuff is ridiculously expensive. A single session is 250$, and he has to have it every week so that'd be nearly 1000 a month!. I offered him to have his session at a regular spa but no, he has to get it from that luxurious spa near the restaurant we used to go saying the lady who gives the massage is an expert and he's used to her.

Problem is I'm the only income earner and I'm struggling to make ends meet. I'm also pregnant and need to save money to prepare a nursery. I told him to cut his sessions but he refused. I told him I won't be paying for them anymore and he said he'd get the money himself.

Yesterday I checked and saw that he's been using my credit card for his sessions for a whole month and had maxed out completely. I found that out when I went shopping for baby essentials and the cashier said I had no money. I had to return everything then went home and went off on him. I told him he maxed my card out and made me look like an idiot at the store, he said he didn't tell me cause he knew I'd have an issue with it. I demanded he pay back the $1000 he spent but he refused, I yelled at him calling him irresponsible and he got upset and called me selfish and told me to stop playing victim and that this is affecting both of us since he's going to be a parent too and it's stressful for him and I keep dismissing his own needs as a human.

AITA for telling my wife it was a mistake to stay at a baby shower?,"So my wife (26F) and I (28M) have been married for a year and began trying to conceive in September. No luck so far but the doctor did say at our first appointment that it typically takes close to a year for most couples to conceive. She’s been telling people that she’s infertile (which isn’t true, doctor said she isn’t). 

My wife and I went to my work Christmas party in mid December, where my wife met my coworkers wife (let’s call her Mary) and they took a liking to each other. Mary was pregnant and invited my wife to her baby shower (which was yesterday), and my wife sounded excited to go. I asked her when we were alone if she thinks she’ll be fine. I know my wife and I know what typically bothers her. I knew she wouldn’t bask in happiness over someone else’s pregnancy so I urged her to think it through. She said she’s fine and she was excited so she went.

The baby shower was yesterday. About 40 minutes in, she calls me and asks me to come. I was at a cafe nearby because I knew she wouldn’t stay long. I find her at the entrance of the house crying and a BUNCH of women consoling her. When she saw me she came to me and pulled me to the garden to talk. She said she was dancing and looked at Mary’s pregnant belly and couldn’t take it anymore, started crying and ran out. All of Mary’s friends followed her out to console her. I consoled her myself, and said “ok let’s go babe. Where do you want to go? We can go for a drive so you can feel better”, she looked at me weird and asked why she would leave. I asked why she would stay. She said she feels better now and can go have a good time. I sighed and said “babe, you know that’s not going to happen. And I doubt the attention will be on Mary after this and that’s not great. It’s her baby shower and she deserves to be celebrated.

AITA for telling my sister there’s a reason her kids chose to live with their dad?,"Throwaway. I (32F) have a 14 year old daughter Jess. Her father and my husband died in an accident when she was young, so it’s been just us two for a long time. As a result we are very close and she’s a lot more open to me then most kids are with their parents. Around a week ago she asked me if I could take her to the movies on a date with a guy in her class. I know the guy distantly because they’ve done some extra curriculars together and I was thrilled he was my daughters first ‘boyfriend’. I took them a few days ago and they ended up hanging out at our house for a bit afterwards. He was extremely polite and maybe it’s just the mum inside me but I couldn’t be happier for her. 

I went to my older sisters house for coffee earlier this morning. Backstory, my sister has two teenagers (16 and 17), who live almost full time with their dad. They had a very messy divorce around three years ago, and both kids choose to live with their dad. The reason for this was because my sister was extremely over bearing on them. She was the kind of mum who believed kids should have no privacy and she should run their lives until they were adults. I know she had many arguments with them because she would take away their doors, not let them hang out with friends, search through their phones every night etc. This was the primary reason for her divorce, although she won’t admit that. While I love her, as someone who grew up with little privacy I fully understand why her kids don’t want to live with her. 

My daughter came up in conversation and so bought up her first date. When I explained how it went, my sister laughed and told me that I must be joking. When she realised I was serious, she told me I was a terrible mother for letting my daughter walk all over me and not setting boundaries. She ranted on for a while but she basically said that 14 year olds are incapable of going out themselves and that I was being lazy and neglectful by allowing her to do that. She also said ‘I would never allow my kids to do that,’ so I replied by saying ‘That’s exactly why your kids drive with their dad.’ She got very quiet and then told me to leave. When I got home I started thinking more about what I said and while at the time I thought I was simply telling her what she needed to hear, now I’m wondering if I crossed the line.",23581,w3hz2u,"NTA.

"AITA for cancelling dinner when my boyfriend brought a bell to the diner to ""grab"" the staff's attention?","


This might sound bad but I don't know if I was TA here.


I (F30) have been dating my boyfriend Rhett (M31) for 4 months, we live in different town and he's not from here, (he's american living here) he usually visits on the weekends, This time I decided to visit his town and eat out at a diner.


Rhett was already there when I arrived to the diner, we talked some, checked the menu, then when it was time to order he pulled a small bell out of his jacket pocket, lifted it up then started shaking it. it produced a loud, annoying sound my ears started hurting. I was so confused I asked what he was doing and he said that he was trying to get one of the waiter staff's attention. I said it was embarrassing and he should stop right then but he kept shaking it. I can not begin to explain the looks we received from everyone.

I demanded him to stop but he said not til someone came and took our order. I threatened to leave the place and cancel dinner if he wouldn't and he kept doing it. Someone came already, but I'd already gotten up, took my purse and started making my way out. He followed me and started arguing about walking out but I told him that I couldn't take being embarrassed by him and he got upset and said that he didn't get why I thought the bell was embarrassing, explained that it was a perfect solution for no longer be forced to wait til someone shows up. I asked if it was acceptable to do this in america and he said ""yes because it's a free country and people there usually don't give a shit"" but I said it's inappropriate and embarrasding here. he said I was being too sensitive and overreacted over nothing. He insisted we go back inside but I refused.



We ended up leaving, he kept on about how I ruined dinner by cancelling it and offending him by acting like his behavior is shamful. I said I had a right to give an opinion on what he's done even if he thought what he was doing  but he basically told me to get off my high horse and stop calling his ""genius"" idea embarrassing.

AITA for refusing to dye my daughter’s hair because her school complained?,"My daughter(15F) dyed her hair dark reddish brown for her birthday.I didn’t let her dye her hair in middle school but said she could in high school. The school has a dress code for hair that just specified “natural hair colors only”. Which I took to mean browns, blondes, reds, black etc basically natural tones. Her natural hair is black but I don’t think it’s much of a change. The hairdresser that did a bleaching on her hair said it was not lighten enough to cause significant damage. 

But then one of the teachers in the beginning of the oct last year began complaining to me during parent teacher meetings that her hair didn’t meet dress code. I said her hair color grew out of people’s heads so why was it out of dress code? She told me it was clearly not her natural color and I shot back tons of her students that I saw that evening had blonde hair and highlights when they clearly natural brunettes. She claimed they look like they could be blonde but my daughter’s hair was suppose to be black. My daughter is Asian so it’s pretty racist to say she can’t dye her hair and I brought it up with the principle but he agreed with her saying it was against dress code. But I saw tons of white kids in her class with obviously brown hair that dyed it blonde and even red but no one said anything. They want me to darken her hair again so it looks “natural”. 

This went on until the end of the school year. I contacted the superintendent several times but she never got back to me. It’s almost the start of school again and I get an email from the principle reminding me my daughter is only allowed black hair. She still has her reddish brown hair and doesn’t want to dye it back.

UPDATE: AITA for not waking my partner up and causing him to miss a family trip?,"https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uuhzi2/aita_for_not_waking_my_partner_up_and_causing_him/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

After posting this I received messages expressing concern and advice so I thought I'd update about how things turned out.

The morning after this incident my partner got out of bed when the kids did and took the older girls out for breakfast. Later I asked him if he'd be willing to read the thread and he agreed. He was very subdued afterwards, and didn't say much except for agreeing that he was an AH. The next day he took off work and saw his GP, started on anti-depressants, and we had a long talk.

He was ashamed by how he was acting and to see strangers comparing him to children. He cried when realised how much he was letting everyone down, especially his daughters who will grow up thinking this is normal behaviour.

He confirmed that this all started when we lived with his parents a few years back. He left home at 17 to get away from his mother, and she told him he'd fail as men need a woman to look after them. He felt like a failure so it was easy for his mother to feed him other ideas, and she would also manipulate things I did to look like he was incompetent as a person (eg. I'd tell him to relax and I'd handle the dishes, and his mother twisted it into me thinking he was incompetent) so he should just stop helping at all. He'd wake up feeling useless, and she managed to convince him that he was unhappy because I wasn't taking care of him the way a wife should.

He decided to got no contact with her which didn't go well. She cried and told him he was a horrible son for abandoning his mother, and that I was trying to control him by 'forcing' him to do it. He blocked her but she'd just use different numbers to continue calling him. After a week or so he ended up changing his number, and we haven't heard from his family since.

He bought up that he was unhappy at work as it wasn't stimulating enough, but he felt like he couldn't leave. I offered to pick up some part time work but he said no. He talked to his boss and took some time off, and eventually quit.

He spoke to my dad who used some connections and got him a good job at his company. The new job is a primarily work from home position, so he is able to help with the girls more and has more free time. He is able to take the girls to school and watch them play while he works which they all enjoy.

Before he started the new job he booked a trip for us to go to the snow for a week. We had a blast and it was lovely to see him relaxed and happy and enjoying our girls and life. He's promised to be more honest about how he's feeling and our relationship has improved immensely.

AITA for refusing to help my partner financially?,"I(43F) have been with my partner(50M) for 6 years now. We have been living together for 5 of them. We are not married and we do not plan to marry in the future.

I have a son(19M) that is currently a highschool senior. My partner has a daughter(21F) who is going to college.

The background you need to understand the issue: when I met my partner I was a widow of 3 years. I am lucky enough to have a very lucrative business and some family money. Also my late husband left a substantial estate, including the house we live in. The house is a family home so it passed to my son as the only heir.
My partner also makes good money and the difference in our lifestyles was pretty much negligible.

But while I and my late husband made sure to not spoil our son (he was responsible for keeping his room clean even though we have a house keeper, he had chores during the weekends, we taught him how to cook, his allowance is reasonable, he has to save for expensive purchases like a car, a PS5...etc). My current partner and his ex-wife spoil their daughter rotten.

Due to an incident when we first moved in together (she demanded my son's bedroom since it was the second biggest, got rejected since it was his home and she only spends the weekend), and after some family therapy we agreed that she will be treated like a guest by me. She will have to follow the house rules and that it the extent of our relationship.

Now while she is spoiled she is a good girl, academically excellent, except for the aforementioned incident very respectful and just a pleasant young woman.

The probelm is that I did not know the extent to which my partner spent money on her. He pays some money as ""rent"" that I put into my son's college fund and we split the common bills in half. Everything else is our own responsibility so we don't know much about each other's finances.

Now my son is planning to do a tour of east Asia during the summer and I was happy to give him the money to do so (as a gift for getting into a very prestigious college). When my stepdaughter heard about it she asked her dad to pay for a tour of Europe since he didn't send her on one after she got into college.

He agreed because he never says no, but he came to me asking me to lend him close to $30k because he can't afford the trip on his own. I am not even giving that much to my son and his plane tickets are more expensive.

I refused. I said that since this wasn't an emergency he can save and send her on the trip after she graduates college. Now he is not talking to me, saying that I am chosing favourites (I have no relationship with his daughter so I don't know how that even is applicable) and that I am putting money over his happiness and relationship with his daughter.

So AITA? I can easily afford to lend him the full amount I just don't want to, because his reasons are not convincing enough.",23428,udy594,"In your split financial setup, you aren't 'playing favorites'.

AITA for telling my husband off for wanting me to let my infertile BIL and his wife experience child birth by being with me in the delivery room?,"


Pleased read the full story.

My husband's brother (BIL 37) and his wife (SIL 35) struggled with infertility for years after trying so much for long they decided to stop. But started...sort of living the experience of having a child by doing the things that parents do like getting a nursery (they removed it now) buying bany cothes, toys, attending school shows etc etc.


I'm 7 months pregnant, and BIL & SIL has been asking many questions on what's it like to be expecting. It was bothersome with them getting involved but I grin & bear til they requested to be with me in the delivery room to experience child birth. I said no and stood firm but later discovered that my husband ""volunteered"" his place to give his brother and his wife both a chance to have this experience. We had a fight and I told him off.

BIL & SIL came over later to try to ""talk me"" into it, I nicely said no but they pushed me so I blew up telling them their fertility problems aren't my fault (harsh I know and regret saying it) and told them to get therapy. Sil started crying, Bil asked me take time to think but I rudely said there was nothing to think about and my mind's already been made. 


They left and my husband starte raging, after yelling at me about how this is his child too and how rude and dismissive I was to his grieving and strugglig brother and wife, he told me to look him in the eyes and tell him if I would be happy to ruin his brother's marriage when I can do this small, yet graceful deed and help BIL and wife ""process"" their trauma and finally make peace with it. I felt so much anger I cried, he told me to get over myself already and stop being purposefully selfish and petty.

AITA for telling my step-mom that she can use the missing child-support payments to fund my part of my dad's gift?,"Sorry for the wordy title, my (18M) dad left my mom when I was 6 (not because of my step-mom), four years ago he met and married my SM Aida, she had 3 kids from a previous marriage that my dad loved to parent instead of me, after they got together I saw him, at best, 7-8 times every year because they moved 5 hour away. A year later he had ''a change of heart'' and demanded his 50/50 custody, which made me miserable, he built a room for me at his new house, tried to fill the missing years with new gifts, even planned a big birthday party for my 12th birthday, at 13, I stopped going to his place. 

For me, he wasn't my dad. After he left, mom's brother (who was only 25 at the time) took me in as one of his boys, mom and I moved back to  my grandparents place and my uncle lived next door, he already had a kid, and he was always there for me, he's my father while my aunt is like a second mother for me and my cousin is like the brother I never had. When I stopped going to my bio-dad's my mom had to get a second job so I used to sleep at my uncle's pretty much every day, I didn't understand why until last year, when my grandma told me my dad had stopped paying child support out of spite and my mom didn't had the money to take him to court. 

Ever since I turned 15, father's day is about my uncle for me, my cousin and I make him breakfast and plan a fun day with him with a small gift, now that I'm 18, my step-mom sent me a fb message saying that I'm old enough to give my part for my bio-dad's gift, this year, his step-kids wants to give him a car and that I should put 10% (like 1,800 to 2,100).

AITA for not inviting my kid's whole class to his birthday party?,"I(28F) am a mother of a wonderful 8 years old son. This whole thing happened last April, but I am still getting complaints. So here I am asking strangers for a judgement on the internet.

So last year was my kid's first year in ""big kids' school"" like he calls it, since his first grade coincided with the pandemic. We are not in the best place financially; like most families, our consumer debt piled on and we are throwing every spare cent at it.

So when it was time to throw him a party, I only invited 5 of his classmates, the ones he considered his friends. For the others I sent 2 dozen cupcakes and juice boxes to class.

The invites were delivered to their houses and not in front of the other kids.

Like I said, money was tight so I got creative. I made 9 small cakes (box cakes, vanilla, chocolate and funfetti), buttercream in different colours. Also made big sugar cookies and different coloured frosting and sprinkles. And finally bought tortillas, made pizza sauce and had a variety of toppings. I asked that the kids bring swimsuits and water guns.

We had a make your own pizza station for lunch, then they played with their water guns. Then they decorated their cakes and finally their cookies to take home with them. That was a Saturday.

Well the next Monday, the kids would not stop raving about how fun the party was, how it was the best birthday party ever. The other kids were not happy to not be invited.

At pick up Tuesday, a couple moms confronted me about not inviting their kids. I said that I am sorry, but it was a small party for his close friends only. They kept complaining about me excluding their kids.

I didn't take it seriously then, but now it is a new school year, almost 6 month later, and I am still getting the occasional comment thrown at me. So AITA?",23350,wy7cud,"NTA.

AITA for announcing the reason why I didn't invite my brother to my wedding and exposing him to the entire family?,"

I (M30) got married 2 weeks ago. I was married before but it ended after I found out that my older brother Thomas (M34) got involved with my first wife. It was devastating because we were close and had a great relationship. I also helped him so much while he was struggling and seeing how he repaid me hurts to this very day. 

I stopped talking to him and Mom and dad forced me to keep it a secret and because I was too weak to argue with them, I just kept my owm distance.


Then I met my now wife. my family loved and embraced her as their own. mom and dad treat her like a queen which helped repaire and soldified my relationship with them. However, as the wedding was approaching they told me they expected me to invite Thomas. I of course refused but they kept guilting me about what the relatives and other guests would think and say when they don't see Thomas there. I fought with them about it til the day of the wedding. Turned out they'd invited him behind my back but I found out and stopped them in time.



They came to the wedding looking pissed asking what we were going to tell people when they ask about Thomas. I told them I'd take care of it. and what I did was take a moment while everyone was paying attention, grabbed the mic and flatout announced this and said ""the reason I didn't invite Thomas to my wedding is because I was worried he'd steal my now wife just like he stole the first one"" I said it playfully to not make it sound so tense but most of the guests looked shocked and started mumbling then it went awkwardly quiet for a moment. then we moved on but I saw Mom and Dad walk out while looking at me grudgingly.


Later they started lashing out about how I just exposed Thomas and caused him to be shunned by the family in the most hideos of ways. I told them that I already said I didn't want him there yet they tried to push him on me repeatedly saying ""what are people going to say"" so I told them the reason why he wasn't there in a playful way but they (the guests) still got the message. Mom started yelling about how everyone will now look down on and shun Thomas, she called me pathetic and cruel for still punishing him and gradually ruining his life despite him apologizing and trying to reconcile but in my opinion? somethings are just unforgivable.

AITA for making my parents choose between my sister going to jail or replacing my car with their vacation money.,"I (f17) live with my parents. I have an older sister (29) that they had when they were super young. Like I think my mom was 19 and my dad was 18. 

They did not do a great job with her and she has a lot of problems.  She is chronically unemployed and she is a thief.  

She has two kids that are okay. They live with us as well because her boyfriend didn't want them around.  I like the kids but they are spoiled little brats my parents dote on to make up for being shitty parents to their mom.  

My parents won't let me put a lock on my door because it is their house and they don't want that.  No problem. I talked to the kids and explained about what would happen if they came into my room without permission. We have an understanding.  

Well my sister broke up with her boyfriend and she needed a place to stay. I begged my parents not to let her stay with us.  They declined. So I begged again for a lock for my door. No dice. 

I have to go to school so I can't guard my stuff at all times.  When I came home on Friday I found my car absolutely trashed and the side of it destroyed.  

My sister had gone into my room, found my spare key and taken my car.  Then lost control on the ice after a day of eating crap and tossing fast food wrappers everywhere. She sideswiped a tree. 

When I saw my car I was livid.  I told my parents that I expected her to pay to fix it.  They said she didn't have any money. So I said that I would call my grandparents. They had helped me get the car and insurance.  

After talking with my grandfather I came back to talk to my parents.  I said that the insurance would cover fixing or replacing my car depending on the damage. But that I would have to file a police report. And that my sister would probably be charged for stealing my car.  They begged me to tell insurance that she had permission.  I said nope. 

So rather than go through insurance they are replacing my car. But they are using money that they had sett aside to take me and my nieces to Orlando next summer for my graduation.  It's fine. I can do without seeing Disney World again.  But my parents, sister, and nieces are upset with me and saying that I'm an asshole for denying my nieces the opportunity to go on a vacation that they have never had.  

I just asked them if a lock for my door would have been cheaper.  

AITA?

AITA for getting angry when my partner announced she’s pregnant?,"My partner (34f) and I (28m) have been together for 5 years. She has a daughter (8) from a previous relationship. Right off the bat, it was made known I had fertility issues and likely wouldn’t ever be able to father a child. I moved slow in the relationship, although I had fallen in love with her fast. When things got serious, I overheard her telling her sister she was concerned that I might be an ‘aggressive type’ person because of the amount of scars I have. I didn’t want her scared away so I told her I had a bad childhood and left it at that. 

A little over two years into our relationship, I felt somewhat comfortable opening up and for the first time I told her exactly why I’m infertile which is a direct result of an injury I suffered due to trauma as a child. She was really empathetic and I was just thankful I had found the one I want to spend my life with that also came with a kid I adore. 

Fast forward to last summer. My partner and her friend decided to play an impromptu prank on me. I came home from work, there were multiple positive pregnancy tests in the bathroom. My partner announced she was pregnant, I started freaking out…a happy freak out cause I thought I had hit the lottery with the slim to none chance I have. They both started laughing, the tests were from the friend and not my partner. 

I was pretty much devastated and felt really let down that my partner would actually pull a prank like that. At first she was shocked by my reaction and said, “I thought you’d know it was a joke considering your circumstances.” She ended up apologizing after realizing how hurt I was. 

Now for the point of the post. Three weeks ago she arranged a huge dinner with her entire family at our house. She had us play this stupid mystery game and ultimately announced to everyone she’s pregnant. Her mother and sisters were deliriously happy. Immediately I got pissed thinking this was yet another prank, so I showed absolutely no emotions which everyone caught on to. I said to my partner, “Either you’re just mentally disturbed or you’re cheating.” That’s pretty much when all hell broke loose. 

My partner’s POV is that she was sincerely apologetic about the prank and I should know her well enough to not think she’d ever pull that stunt again. She’s also livid at me for ruining the announcement, embarrassing her in front of her entire family, causing them to think I’m a horrible person and then finally insinuating that she’s a cheater. 

I still stand by my claim that had she never pranked me, my reaction would have been different. I do find it odd she decided to tell me along with her family. Things would have likely went over better had she told me first, and then we announced it together. But I’m starting to think I acted immaturely causing scene in front of her family, and I think that’s maybe where I’m wrong.",23301,wau52s,Who the fuck announces pregnancy to their partner and family AT THE SAME TIME???,503,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wau52s/aita_for_getting_angry_when_my_partner_announced/
AITA? I reported my car missing after my husband took it to attend his brother's wedding.,"
My husband (35) does not have a car. He sold his old one to help pay for his brother's wedding. I did not agree on this but he had this car before we got together so it's a shared property. besides that I have my own car so that did not affect me til my husband started complaining about having to commute to work and hangout places. He tried to get me to let him drive my car several times but I stood firm and put a boundary making him understand that my car will never be driven by him (one of the reasons why is because of how bad his driving is).


His brother lives out of town. My husband asked if he could drive my car to the wedding but I refused but not because I'm not imvited (another story for another day) buy because like I said my car is off limits. He threw a fit calling me unreasonable to let him take public transportation because he can barely stand it for 10 minutes let alone hours.  I said it wasn't my problem which irritated him but made him stop arguing about it.


The day that he was supposed to travel out of town. I woke at 10am and couldn't find my car key. I went outside and couldn't find my car either. I was beyond pissed. I called him and like I expected, he took it and was on his way to the other town. I lost it and told him I gave him no permission to take it for whole 5 days and said that if he won't turn around with it and come home then I'd call the cops and report it missing. His response was ""You wouldn't dare do it cause you know what would happen"" I hung up on him then immediately called the police and told them about my situation. I did NOT tell them my husband took it because they'd think it's a family dispute and decide to not get involved. I just reported it missing.

2 hours later I got a call from my husband saying he was back in town and was being held at our local police station. I went to the station and talked to the cops. My husband made a scene there swearing over and over that I gave him permission to take it and said I was acting out of jealousy and spite because he was going to attent a wedding that I was not invited to. I took my car and went home but he had to stay a little longer.

He came home in the evening and went on a rage fit about how I created an awful situation and almost caused him to miss his brother's wedding. He called me vindictive, bitter and a lunatic to call the police on him and try to accuse him of stealing my car. He had to leave the same day to be able to be there with his family and decided to extent his stay and he still hasn't gotten back yet.

Right now his mom and brother are blasting me for what happened and calling me spiteful.",23290,v4no1d,I can’t see your marriage lasting much longer,1666,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v4no1d/aita_i_reported_my_car_missing_after_my_husband/
AITA for putting a private conversation on loud speaker which cost my brother his 18 year relationship,"Ok guys I’m extremely tried and it’s been a long ass day so please excuse any poor grammar or spelling mistakes 


To begin my brother Ben (39m fake name ) has been in a relationship with Abby(39 fake name) 18 years. They’ve been engaged 8 years they’ve nearly gotten married 3 years ago but months before the wedding Ben chickened out. 

They went to therapy and basically because our dad left us he has issues with commitment.
We thought over the last year he was finally gonna step up for Abby and be the partner she deserves. He did seem a bit anxious leading up to the big day but assured everyone he was ok 


Today they were meant to get married but as abby and us bridesmaids were about to enter the church Ben was no where to be found 

Everyone tried to calm her down saying it was traffic or he probably had a monster hangover.
Well an hour passed, than two, than three and than after the four hour mark Abby said fuck she was going back to the hotel call her when he landed.

My family looked panicked and nervous trying to get through to Ben or the groomsmen who had not arrived yet 

My other brothers and brother in laws (sister’s husband) went looking for him thinking he got hurt or arrested the night before 

I went back to the hotel with a very broken looking Abby. We drank and ate food for another hour before I got a text from my brother in law saying they found him in a bar and they were trying to talk him into GOING TO HIS OWN WEDDING. My sister rang her husband and heard him in the background  he was literally acting like a 5 year old who didn’t want to go to the doctor 

Honestly guys I had enough at this stage he mess this girl about too long and frankly leading someone along for 18 years is just cruel 


So he’s here’s were I maybe the asshole of the century. I walked into Abby’s room and told her be quiet than I rang my brother in law put him on loud speaker and asked him what was going on than for him to put Ben on the phone the drunk fool started saying shit like he didn’t think she was the one and he is only with her because they’ve been together to long and he is scared to be alone 

I let her hear everything I won’t lie I felt like a monster when she started crying. Abby than grabbed the phone told him he had one hour to get to the church or it was over for good 


Long story short Ben ended up at the Church 20 minutes later and Abby took off her dress than left the hotel alone 

So he ended being left a the Alter and she went on the honeymoon alone. I’ve been disowned by everyone expect two siblings (sisters) and I had to get Abby’s maid of honour to collect my suitcase from outside the hotel (mom dumped out when she found out) 

I’m the full blame for ruining their relationship and 98% of my family hates me",23233,u90414,NTA personally I think she needed to hear his true thoughts.

AITA for refusing to watch my sister's stepkid and exposing her lies to her husband?,"

My f/21 sister Jess, f/30, is married and has a 5 yo stepson. her husband works full time and she is a sahm.


Every monday, she'd call my mom at 9am to get her to go over to her house and watch her stepkid for few hours, I live at home with my parents and so I've noticed this routine for weeks now.

Last week mom went out of town to visit some relatives, and yesterday (monday) at 9am my sister called asking me to come watch her stepkid for few hours because she had an important thing to do. I said no because I had to go study and also she does this every monday so clearly it wasn't important or urgent but she insisted it was, I told her sorry but no. She ended the call then I went to the university.


Hours later, I got a call from my brother in law asking where my sister was, I said I had no idea. he proceeded to tell me he just came home at 1pm and found his son by himself at the house. I was in shock that my sister left her stepkid by himself so she could go God knows where. I told him about the conversation I had with her and he got angry.

In the evening my sister came over and started making a scene by yelling at me for bailing on her after she sent me a text message telling me she was already out the house to force me to come watch her stepson. I didn't see the fb message til she told me but she said I did this deliberately and also, exposed her to her husband because she told him she'd be at home with the kid. Not just that, but I also told her husband that mom comes over every monday morning to watch the kid for few hours which caused a huge fight between him and my sister. She yelled that I was petty and selfish and just stirred shit and caused issues in her marriage by tattling to her husband. I couldn't keep arguing I went into my room and started playing music. My dad and the others said I was to blame for not helping my sister and now being the reason she and her husband are in conflict.


AITA?

Okay guys so I saw few questions asked multiple times so I'll just put the answers out here for all to see.

1) My brother in law's wife is deceased.

2) brother in law is always at work when my sister calls my mom to get her to come over and watch her stepson.

3) most of you guys are asking where my sister goes every monday, and I even saw someone mention that I was YTA for not finding out, but I don't know anything, I have no idea what's going with my sister and I thought it was non of my business.


UPDATE: Guys! I've decided to try and find out what is really going with Jess. I'm not the type to snoop and it's not my business but she already made it my business by turning the family against me because of something she did. Ngl I came here thinking I was going to get toast but I wrong, thank goodness for that. I'll update as soon as possible.

"AITA for tipping our waitress 20 dollars despite her poor service, because my date was playing a ""game"" with her tips?","I met a guy on a dating app, we hit it off and we arranged for our first date. Things were going well, we had sat down and had started some small chat. Our waitress comes over asking us what we want to order.

I say what I want and gesture to him so he can order. He orders and then pulls what I think is about 15 dollars on the table. He says ""This is your tip. Everytime you mess up, I take some away"".

The waitress looked nervous immediately. I'm sitting there a bit shocked, but mostly embarrassed because I wasn't expecting this. She must have been new as well, because she did spill some drinks on our table that night, gave us the wrong food, and overall just seemed lost. He took away 13 dollars. 

I asked him why he thought doing tips this way was a good idea. He said it was the best way to ensure ""good service"". When I disagreed he said ""Cant always be nice to these people, it's not a respectable job"".

I decided then that I wanted nothing to do with him, and called the waitress over to get the bill. I slapped a 20 dollar bill in her hand and got up to pay for my own meal. 

Later that night he had demanded to know why I had given her the tip despite her poor service and I told him it's because he decided to treat her livelihood like it was a game. He said because of me she'll never improve her service and that I'm just a people pleaser. 

I blocked him, but I've wondered ever since if that was really the right thing to do.

AITA for refusing to split rent with my boyfriend?,"I (F23) have been dating my boyfriend “Jake” (M23) since our freshmen year of college. In our last year of undergrad, we decided to rent an apartment together. We split everything 50/50, including utilities, groceries, and rent. We continued living together in the same town as our college after graduation, but recently, we both got jobs in Chicago and we are currently living downtown. My dad works in real estate, and he has multiple investment properties. My dad generously allowed me to live in one of his properties rent free, but he said that my boyfriend would have to pay him $400 a month for rent. My dad is very protective, but he has been nothing but kind to my boyfriend. My dads reasoning for making my boyfriend pay rent is that he wants to be sure that my boyfriend is with me for me, and not because he will have a free place to live. (Keep in mind, if my dad was renting this apartment out to tenants, he would charge $2100 a month for rent. Very ritzy building in the middle of downtown Chicago). 

My boyfriend is mad at me because he asked me for my half of the $400 for rent, and I explained to him that I will not be paying rent. My dad is only charging him. He says that we have been splitting rent for the past 2 years so why would we stop now? 

Our rent in our college town was $1200, so we were both paying $600 a month. Our apartment in Chicago is significantly nicer and he is paying $200 less a month than what he was in college. 

Is the idea that my DAD doesn’t charge me for rent, but charges my boyfriend so crazy? Should I suck it up and pay half because I can afford it?

AITA for tricking my husband into eating the food I cooked by making him think his mom sent it?,"My husband ""Mickey"" loves his mom's cooking. He always praises her for the food she makes and even mentioned it in his groom speech at the wedding!


I consider myself a good cook. In fact, I'm going to just say that I'm even better than his mom. but the problem is he doesn't even want to try my cooking or give me a chance to prove it, I thought this would change after marriage but 5 months later nothing's changed. What does he eat if he's not eating what I'm cooking? He has requested that his mom send him a meal everyday to eat for dinner after getting off work except for the weekend where we go over to her house and eats breakfast, lunch, dinner and DESSERT there. 


Every single day he'd come home and ask if his mom sent him a meal. I grew irritated of this and whenever I try to offer him to taste any of the (wasted) food I cook, he'd lay in bed and say he's full.


So I came up with an idea. I cooked him the same meal his mom sent him that day and put it aside til he got home. He asked if his mom sent a meal for dinner and I said yes and served him my own version of the meal - not hers. He didn't notice anything different. he ate the whole thing with no hasitation while I sat across from him asking him questions about how good the meal was. He went on and on praising it saying how perfect, exceptional it was, and how it was just what he needed after a long day at work.


I smiled and said ""You're welcome"". He froze and looked at me for a minute. Looked down at the plate then back at me and said ""wait, you made this didn't you?"" I said ""With my own hand and from scratch"". His face suddenly went red and he got upset and said that this was not cool. I told him he never even gave me a chance to show him how good my cooking is and that he's probably just used to his mom's cooking and is rejecting any other alternatives which's unfair to me. He said that I shouldn't have lied to him and basically tricked him into eating food that he had no idea where it came from. I said he liked it and admitted that it was good so what's the issue. He got up from his seat, threw the napkin and said that I was unbelievable then walked out.


He got quiet the rest if the evening then posted about it on his FB in a vague post about being tricked into eating ""someone's"" food like that. I felt guilty and bad thinking maybe I really shouldn't have done this but I was frusrtated with how he kept turning down every meal I tried to cook him and then say ""No thanks, I prefer mom's food"".

AITA for getting back the money my husband took from our IVF treatment and gave to his friend?,"
To start off I want to say that my husband (36M) has an old friend (33M) that he's known since highschool. they're inseperable and spend the entire week together. like they're really really close.

My husband and I struggled with fertility issues for years. we recently started new method (IVF) in hopes to get at least one child together. Note that I saved for the majority of treatment while my husband only paid 2-3 thousands. We saved up for another round after the huge disappointment and heartbreak from failing the first time (that's just how it goes). This time I'd put all the money (including dad's inhertance) and my husband didn't pay a cent.


Last week I found out that he secretly pulled out 7k (we had 11k in total). I was completely and utterly shocked I confronted him and he casually reminded me of how many times his best friend complained about his ""old junk"" car and he decided to ""lend"" him 7k to buy a decent car, his argument was that his friend would've done the same for him. I was beyond livid I asked if he really thought that was okay and he said that I shouldn't worry and guaranteed his friend will pay us back in time. I lost it on him and immediately demanded his friend to send the money back and threatened police involvement in case he refused. His friend immediately returned the money but told my husband about the polic thing and my husband came home and yelled at me calling me unhinged and selfish. I told him I saved up some of this money/used my inheritance for this treatment while he contributed nothing even though we're in this together. He ""corrected"" me saying I'm the one with the problem and he thought it's only fair that I ""make up"" for it by paying for the IVF myself. This hurt so badly and I couldn't argue anymore. He went to stay with his friend while constantly shaming me for how I treated them both and for the police invovlement like they stole from me or something.",23100,vm861k,"NTA and I think it's evident at this point you are no longer in a committed relationship. Your husband has finally revealed several things to you. Something I don't think you realize that he revealed is that he no longer thinks you will have a child no matter what. If he was in it to have a child he wouldn't have pulled that money out to begin with. It was a hit or miss on whether or not the friend could repay that 7 k in time. If he needed it then its not something he can easily acquire back. On top of this your husband is now outwardly hurting you by saying you are the one with the problem and is effectively saying it isn't his fault. Your husband no longer wants to have a child with you. And his lack of cate and feelings for you, as well as how ready he was to steal money from you, just shows that this relationship is over. 

For your own mental safety I recommend leaving him and finding someone to love who is mentally available to take this journey with you. Your husband is not this man.",3189,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vm861k/aita_for_getting_back_the_money_my_husband_took/
AITA for refusing to put my fiance on the house title after he kept handing me empty pens as a prank?,"I F, 34 have been with my fiance M, 37 for 3 years. Getting married before the end of this year and recently moved in the house that I inherited from my mom. The house is in my name and it took a lot of talking and convincing from him to have his name on the title as well. Now honestly part of me doesn't think this is a good idea, at least not right now maybe after marriage? But anyway, I've decided to go ahead and put his name on the title so he could go ahead and start contributing towards mortgage more and light my burden a little bit. 

We've made appointments, decided on which form of ownership we were basing this on. when it was time for me to sign the deed, My fiance stopped me and gave me a pen saying this pen was his ""lucky"" pen and told me to use it to sign the deed. I took it and tried to sign but turned out it was empty. He was like ""oh I must've forgotten"" while laughing and then pulled out his ""other lucky pen"". I took it, tried to sign and that one too was empty. Honestly, seeing how he was laughing I figured he was messing with me but he swore he wasn't and pulled out ANOTHER one of his lucky pens. I tried that one too and it was empty. my fiance started cackling and I felt humiliated especially with how the gentleman next to him was staring. I got pissed and asked him what that was about and he said it was a prank. I asked ""really? Did you really think this was a time for pranks?"" He was like ""it's alright you can use ""a real pen"" now"". I pushed the paper away and said ""you know what? Never mind because I no longer want you on the deed"". He lost it completely saying we had a deal and I can't back out of it just like that, and that it was a stupid joke that I took too seriously. We had an argument and I refused to sign the deed at least not then and there. 

At home he blew up again saying I was the one who ""delayed the process"" and that he already gave me a real pen and all I had to do was sign the ""damn paper"" and get it over with. He accused me of looking for an excuse not to have him on the deed and started the silent treatment saying there's nothing to say til those papers are signed.

Did I really take this too seriously?",23047,w4gcao,"Please don't add him. He pressured you before marriage and after your bereavement -  he should be supporting you.

Put the house into a trust,  that will protect it and get a pre nup to protect your asset. Not legally binding in the UK at the moment but influences a divorce decision.

Personally I wouldn't marry him because of the pressure exerted when you are most vulnerable and the stupid prank at a legal appointment when it's costing you several hundred pounds for the advice and actual appointment. He uses this to humiliate you.

You've got an appreciable asset in your name entirely. He hasn't. Perhaps he's expressing his jealousy and acting up?

AITA for doing the absolute minimum chores after my girlfriend parents implied I wasn't a man and she agreed with them?,"Sorry if some of sentences feel awkward, I am not a native speaker.
I work from home and my job is relaxed and doesn't require me to be glued to the screen, my girlfriend works in a stressful customer service job and most of her days are terrible. In the 2 years we've been living together, I do practically all the chores around the house and I try to treat her to like a queen when she comes back home. However, the one thing I can't do is be a handyman no matter how easy the task is. A few months ago, the bathroom door hinges needed replacing so I called a friend to help.

Last week during lunch with her parents, I asked her dad about the project he was working on (he does woodworking as a hobby). He showed me the progress on his phone and suggested I should help him with the last touches.

My girlfriend told him that I can't even replace door hinges let alone help with that. Her mom said that every man should know how to fix things around the house and her husband agreed with her. The remainder of lunch was very awkward, it was like they were my real parents and were disappointed of me for being a huge failure.

After we left, I told my girlfriend that I didn't expect their reaction. Instead of taking my side, she said that they were right because it was embarrassing that I need to call a friend to help with something trivial.

I reminded her that I get nervous and anxious everytime I touch a tool. I admitted it was stupid but it's just the way I am and has been very honest with her since the start. Still she didn't change her mind.

I told her that since their idea of being a man is twisted I must share the same view and start working on being their version of a man. I told her that I will stop cooking for her.

AITA for letting my MIL and SIL find our (hubby's and mine) bedroom toys because I suspected they snooped in my drawers?,"My (27F) husband (32M) and I have been dating for 6 years and married for 4, we have a 3 year old baby boy and since we don't plan on having more children, I told my husband that I wanted to get my boobs redone because I wanted them more perky and I had surgery last year. 

My MIL has always been sniffy because my husband is her only son, we've gone LC over the years because she's overbearing with him and dismissing with me, things got a little better when our baby was born, but after my surgery? oof, it's like I wrote in my forehead ''LOOK AT MY BOOBS, I WANT TO CHEAT ON MY HUSBAND'', she's always implying that I did it for male validation (yeah, your son's ffs), that I'll leave my husband, that I look like a hooker because I wear stuff that shows cleavage, that I could've gotten them a little smaller, everything. She also complaint about my clothes (and underwear) a lot, because ''no married woman with a child should dress like this''.

And see, that's what stung me because, how could she know? I suspected she was going in my drawers, but my husband told me that *she could never*, she made a comment about a cute set of lingerie that shows basically everything and I was confused, I asked how'd she knows I have it and she said ''she saw it in the washing machine'' but I prefer to wash my sets by hand so the lace last longer.

We heard my MIL calling us and when we went to our room they were standing next to my open drawer, I just snorted, looked at my husband and said ''see? she snoops.'' My husband got red in the face, berated my MIL and my SIL and they both left after calling me indecent.

AITA for going into the ladies room?,"I am a 31 yo man and was at a large store yesterday with my 5mo son when he did what babies do. I went over to the restrooms and saw that there wasn't a family/companion restroom, just a men's and women's. I went into the men's room and saw there was a cubicle and a few urinals, but no changing table. The sink didn't have a counter either.

I walked out and hunted down an employee to ask where the changing table was. She said it was in the bathroom, and I asked where, assuming there was a family/companion restroom on the other side of the store. She took me back to where I just was. I asked if there was another bathroom, and she said no. I told her I was just in the bathroom and there was no changing table. She asked if I was sure and suggested I look again.

I was annoyed, but I went back in the men's room. No changing table. When I came out the employee was gone. Keep in mind, my son has been in his poopy diaper this whole time. So I give up and head into the lady's room which sure enough had a changing table. There was a woman in there washing her hands, and she said ""wrong bathroom, buddy.""

I gestured to my son and said ""no changing table in the men's room."" She laughed and said ""bro, that sucks."" Then she walked out. So I rush to change him, hoping to be done before anyone else walked in. I'm almost done when a woman walks in and starts screaming at me. I tried to explain what I was doing, but she kept screaming ""Get out! You can't be here!"" Then she ran out.

I finished putting the diaper on and rushed out of the bathroom. I saw the woman talking to an employee and decided to leave without my stuff. The employee tried to wave me down and stop me, but I rushed out to my car, buckled my son into his carseat and left.

From the nature of my work I also have a large and valuable collection of jewellery but also gem specimens that I keep in a safe I specifically bought and had installed to keep them safe. I also have a second smaller safe for keeping important documents like passports. 

I own my home and my boyfriend (33m) of 2 years recently moved in as he was renting before. I gave him the code to the smaller safe so he could put valuables in it, but he also wants the code for my gem safe. Not to put anything in it, but he says because we are living together now I should trust him and give him the code. I’ve said no because he has no reason to open the safe as the only thing it’s used for is storing my collection, he’s said he has no interest in my gem collection, doesn’t want to look at them, but still wants the code to access them. 

This is causing tension because he says I should give it to him as a show of trust, and I said no, because he literally has no reason to go in there so he doesn’t need the code. This is a 6 figure collection so I’m not being difficult over a few little gems here. I am the only one who knows the code. 

So Reddit am I being TA here? 

*also we are in the UK so we spell jewellery differently to the US

Edit: holy hell this blew up way more than I ever expected! Im sticking to my guns and I’m not giving him the code. All you lovely internet strangers are right, it’s a huge marinara flag and I’ll be telling him to pack his stuff. I’ll update you later. Thank you all for your comments!!

Edit 2: this keeps coming up, the safe weighs nearly half a ton, it’s bolted to the floor and wall and is from a company who make safes, vaults and strong rooms for jewellers. You could bring the house down around it and it would still be intact.

Final edit: I think I have phrased it badly but all of the gems and jewellery in the safe are mine and mine alone. I do not keep any clients jewellery at home. For my other business doing valuations I rent a separate space and keep client items there. 

I will give an update once things have panned out

Another edit: I’ve checked for cameras (thank you for the suggestions people) and there aren’t any aside from the ones I already have fitted which he doesn’t have access to. I’ve moved all of my personal docs out of the little safe and into my gem safe. I’ve told my colleague what I’m doing and she is going to come around for when I do it. 

Update: 

Firstly thank you so much for the insane amount of comments and support, it meant so much to me.  For all of your messages and questions I’m really sorry if I didn’t get to you there were just so many! 

I probably didn’t emphasise in my last post that we had a couple of conversations about this and me explaining why he had no reason to go in there etc. 

Short version is I told him he isn’t getting the code and I will die on this hill. He has no reason to have it and his continued lack of respect by the pushing of my boundaries wasn’t ok, I felt like he was trying to manipulate me by making it about trust.

After a lot of back and forth he finally admitted that he wanted access to the safe because he didn’t feel like I was sharing the whole house with him, because I insisted on a tenancy agreement rather than just letting him move in, and he didn’t like that part of where he lived was off limits to him. He was also insecure and resented that  I have more money than him and own a home whilst he doesn’t, he had made a few comments about this before but I didn’t realise it was such a big issue for him. He also said that by keeping him out of the safe made him feel like I thought he was lesser than me and that it made him feel like I was treating him like a child. 

I told him if that’s how he feels then this is not the right relationship for either of us and that it was best we break up. He was shocked that I was ending things over this, cried and asked me to reconsider, when I said no he then got angry, called me a stuck up b*tch said he was better off without me anyway and went to his friends. I told him via text he had 30 days before he had to leave (as per the tenancy agreement) so he didn’t need to stay at a friends, he said he would be gone by the end of the week. 2 days later he came back and packed up all of his stuff and left, he’s staying with his friend now. 

I have changed all the locks, I have an alarm and cctv system that’s professionally monitored and I have changed the verbal password I have to give when you call up as a precaution. I’ve checked all of my collection and it hasn’t been touched. I also took your guys advice and am giving my solicitor the code and safe deposit details to be passed to my executor in the event of my death. 

I feel horrible because despite all of this I love him, but lot’s of the comments said how I should have a partner who not only respects my boundaries but takes an interest in my passions and that really got to me because it’s true, so may of you reached out with questions and it made me so happy, but also sad as he never asked me stuff like that, I think this is what pushed me over the edge to end it more than anything. 

I’m pretty cut up right now and missing him, but I know I’ll be ok, I have great friends and family around me, also diamonds are a girls best friend and I have a few knocking around to help cheer me up!",22933,v9tw6c,"NTA.

"AITA for ""forcing"" my husband to sleep on the couch.","


This conflict is pretty recent. I (f29) used to use tampons for my periods but due to medical reasons couldn't do it anymore. now I'm using pads which isn't that big of a deal but my husband disagrees. He firstly complained about me not ""consulting"" him first but like I said it's not a huge deal like BC. He then said he doesn't feel comfortable with me sleeping in bed wearing pads. this threw me off hard because I wasn't expecting him to have an issue on that regard, but he said it just doesn't feel comfortable *for him* and he would like me to use tampons at nighttime or sleep somewhere else. I laughed him off and kept sleeping on the bed while wearing my pads like there was no issue. This made him so uncomfortable he basically took the couch then started complaining about how I forced him on the couch by making him uncomfortable after he already offered me compromises. but I told him he was being a drama queen because his compromises are illogical, I wouldn't stop using pads and free bleed on the bed nor risk my health and use tampons when the doctor advised again them. he's still upset with me even though I'm no longer on my period saying I owe him for making him uncomfortable and brushing off his complaints.",22916,u9vtvq,"‘He firstly complained about me not “consulting” him—‘ Automatic NTA.

AITA for not wanting my husband to go to his ex's funeral?,"I'll admit I'm biased right off the bat. I couldn't stand her.

I call her ""his ex"" to myself and others. He called her ""his friend"".

We're all in our early 40s. She died recently - aneurysm. 

I've been with him 10 years now, but he'd known her for 20+.

The way he tells it: They were friends in college, decided to date, got married, then realized they weren't a great couple and decided to just be friends. All that happened years before I met him. He was clear early on that she was ""important"". 

A couple months into dating, it came up that his *friend* was actually his *ex-wife*. He explained the above to me, saying she was one of his closest friends and that it was purely platonic. I expressed some discomfort at him being so close to an ex, and he told me ""That's fine. If you have a serious issue with it, let me know now and save us some time. I'll choose her. I like you and all, but I've known her for over 12 years and she's one of the most important people in my life. You'll have to be ok with that if you want us to be a thing."" 

When we were engaged I asked again. He gave me this perplexed look & asked ""Why would us getting married affect my friendships?""

I sucked it up & went along. I resented every moment of knowing her, especially when we had to be social. She understood some part of him I couldn't. Her husband was friends with mine as well, so it's not like I could use him as an angle.

He'd have lunch with the ex, they'd go to their geeky movies, and whatever. 

The few times I brought it up he said ""We had this conversation before. You had your chance to back out.""

She died after they had lunch the other day on the way to her car. He spent a bunch of time crying, but honestly I was relieved.

He was working with her husband on funeral planning. I told him ""You don't think you're going, do you?""

My argument, summed up: She's dead, so she's not a factor anymore. He doesn't get to use his ""she's my friend"" excuse since she doesn't exist anymore. He had his cry for a couple days, he gets to be done with mourning her already. There's no need for him to go to her funeral, since I wouldn't want her at his.

He was the angriest I've ever seen him when I told him that, replying that he'll be going no matter how I feel, and that he's ""willing to burn this to the fucking ground"" while holding up his wedding band. ""Besides you, she was the closest friend in my life.""

Him, her husband & my sisters are calling me an insensitive asshole over this, all saying that there was no romantic aspect to their relationship, & that I'm heartless. Her husband went so far as calling me a ""ghoul"" for how I've reacted.

I never felt their relationship was appropriate, and I hid that for years because I wanted to be  with my husband. Now that she's gone, I don't feel I should have to hide it anymore, and can speak freely. 

AITA for just wanting him to be *done* with her, and for him to not attend the funeral?",22903,zpz8tc,">She died after they had lunch the other day on the way to her car. He spent a bunch of time crying, but honestly I was relieved.

AITA for getting my interviewer fired?,"I (f27) went to a job interview for a potential job opportunity at this company. The interviewer, we'll call him ""Eddie"" (30ish) welcomed me into the office and had me sit down. First thing he did was look at my CV then started asking me questions that seemed a little to personal and unrelated to the job. like if I was in a relationship, wether my eye color was ""real"" or just 'lenses"", also asked about how I spend my time when ""alone"" and what type of dudes I like. Like legit personal questions. Don't know if he was testing how I react but I kept it cool til he asked me the question of what my greatest weakness was. I responded by saying ""keeping up with your inappropriate questions and answering them politely!"". He looked at me upset and then told me I had an ""attitude"". it was clear that the interview was over. He told me I didn't get the job which I found unfair because I don't think I desreved to lose the job over what? nothing. I got into an argument with him then told him I was going to report him.

I went to speak to the supervisor and filed a complaint against Eddie. the supervisor apologized to me and tried to reschedule a new interview but I was hasitant about it. Later I was told that Eddie got fired which made me feel guilty. My mom and dad agreed that his questions were inappropriate but said that I went too far by reporting him and having him fired. Eddie tried contacting me via email saying that what I did could've been resolved between us and even said he could've arranged a new interview for me but I ""ruined"" it for myself and cost him his job.

"AITA for giving my son's new bike away after the ""prank"" he pulled on a girl he was friends with?","So recently I found out my son ""Jacob"" (15) pulled an incredibly cruel ""prank"" on one of the girls I'll call ""Ashley"" that's in his friend group. I know this girl, she's been to our house and even attended Jacob's birthday party a month ago. She seemed incredibly sweet if not a bit shy. So when my oldest son ""Mark"" (17) came to me and told me Jacob had asked Ashley out on a date as a prank I was stunned.

I of course asked how he could know this, hoping as any mother would that it wasn't true. But Mark showed me the family tablet we all use (but mostly my sons do) and it seems Jacob forgot to log out of his chatting app, discord. I read the long series of messages between Jacob and his friends as they mocked Ashley all through this heartless prank. I was speechless. And that's not even getting into HOW he was talking, like he was some thug and not a 15 year old living in a gated community.

At first I couldn't figure out what to do, or how to proceed. I'll admit that I never once imagined either of my boys would be the type of person to do something like that. But there was no way in hell I was letting this go. So after a day of thought I decided what was going to happen. First things first, he was grounded, for how long I'm not sure. Secondly, I'd gotten Jacob a bike for his birthday but it hadn't arrived until the day previous and I'd planned to give it to him when my parents came to visit since they'd been unable to make his party.

But instead of that I showed him I knew about the ""prank"" and told him he was grounded, then I made him carry the new bike out of my bedroom closet and to the car before driving to Ashley's house, him crying the whole way. I'd called her parents earlier and explained everything and so once we got there I had him cart it to their front porch and ring the bell. Then in front of me, Ashley, her parents, and God I had him give a sincere apology and gift her the bike. Even I apologized to her, saying I didn't raise my boy this way and what he did was unforgivable. I also called the parents of the other boys who were apart of this little stunt and they all seemed rightfully horrified by their sons' involvement.

I felt I'd handled this all as best as I could, and my friends agreed. Though once my parents found out that I'd made Jacob give his birthday gift away they said what I did went too far. I still feel like what I did was right but having my parents more or less dog pile on me like this actually made me wonder if how I handled it was too extreme? AITA here?",22865,su4efr,As someone who has been ‘pranked’ like this it’s very refreshing to see you stand up for her and not just excuse away what your son did.

AITA for not moving back home with my parents?,"My (18M) parents planned on being a child free couple, but because of religious beliefs they kept me even if I was an unwanted pregnancy.

I don't remember when exactly I was told, but I always knew that I would be expected to move out as soon as I reached 18 years old. I have been working and saving since I turned 13 and have a respectable ammount in a savings account.

Now to be fair to my parents, they provided for me financially, they were distant emotionally but they have never been abusive.

A week before my 18th birthday (January 13th) they sat me down and asked if I have found a place to move into yet. I said yes and that was the extent of the conversation.

I was planning to live in an apartment with 4 other guys, but a friend's family heard about it and offered me their finished basement with separate access for a very cheap price ($150 a month utilities included, no down payment required). So I jumped at the opportunity even though I know it is a pity offer. It is relevant that both his family and mine are of Indian descent.

I moved out the day after my birthday and my parents haven't contacted me since. I admit that I did not reach out to them too.

Yesterday my dad called to invite me to dinner. It was awkward even before they asked me to move back in, said I don't have to pay them rent or anything. But here's the thing, I like my new living situation, it lacks the awkwardness and tension that I didn't even know was there untill I moved out.

When I said no, politely at that and thanking them for the offer, my mother started crying and left the room, while my dad started scolding me and saying that their friends are excluding them because of the ""rumour"" that they threw me out and another desi family had to take me in.

I said that that was exactly what happened, and it isn't my job to save them from the consequences of their actions and decisions.

Now my whole extended family is calling me nonstop and saying I am being an AH.

So AITA?

Edit: first I want to thank you all for the kind comments and well wishes, I was hesitating for a moment there and you all made me feel so much better about my decision. I read every comment and appreciate every award. Didn't think this post would explode like this but I am happy because of all the nice comments.

To answer a question that was asked by a lot of my fellow desi Redditors: I think my parents thought that I would be moving with strangers and they could say that I was trying to be independent and they were supportive of that. But when I moved with people from the community they couldn't pretend anymore.

Also I think the aunty and uncle I live with are the ones who told people about the situation, they are extremely nice and were very upset about what my parents did. They have offered me to live with them as long as I wish and were not even going to accept any rent except I insisted.",22830,scxsv8,"“ saying that their friends are excluding them because of the ""rumour"" that they threw me out and another desi family had to take me in.”

NTA they don’t want you to move back because they care for you they just want to look good to their friends.

UPDATE: AITA for telling everyone to leave me the fuck alone?,"Wow. I have never felt so supported and loved in a very long time. I wasn’t even going to post anything but I’m so happy I did. 

I don’t know how to explain just how big of an impact everyone’s comments and dms had on me. It was so lovely. Thank you so much for all the offers of friendship, and more. 

So as of a few weeks ago, I moved in with my father. Being alone with my son had me going crazy. The loneliness was literally killing me. I needed help and I am no longer ashamed to admit it. My dad made the offer.

I work Mon-Fri and have the weekends off and well I’ve been following everyone’s advice and signed up for a mommy and me thing nearby. It was nerve wrecking but so many moms were so friendly and came up to me themselves. I got three numbers and they’re all inviting me to a dinner party. They’re really sweet despite being at least 5 years older than me. They’ve sort of adopted me lol (their words not mine).

I’m also going for walks after work. My dad and son come along sometimes. Me and my dad also cook together and we make some pretty neat stuff for his girlfriend who has also been really kind. 

As for my mother and sisters, I still don’t know why they dislike me and my baby so much. But I took that step and left the GC. This might sound ridiculous but it was really hard. I even shed a tear. But I did it. They haven’t spoken to me since.

I contacted my in laws one last time. Idk why but his parents said they were willing to meet. They won’t try and take him from me but my dad got me a lawyer just in case. I’m meeting them this weekend and depending on how it goes, I will let them see my son eventually. 

Finally, I saw a doctor and I’ve been diagnosed with PPD. I’m currently seeing a therapist that was recommended to me and have started a treatment plan. My son, father and his gf have been my biggest supporters and I‘m trying to be better for me but them as well. I’ve also been missing my fiancé a lot these days but his memory is kind of calming. Idk.

It hasn’t been very long but I’m already seeing improvements in my life. It’s crazy how making my original post kickstarted this change. Thank you so very much for everything.

Edit:

Thank you so so so much for all the nice comments and messages. I’m trying to read them all but there’s too many and I cannot keep up haha. I’ve shed a few tears as well.

The meeting with my in laws went well and my fiancé’s mother cried a lot and said she was so sorry. I didn’t give too many details but I did show them pictures of my son. They still won’t be meeting him till a lot later and without me but it’s progress. Also I call my fiancé my bf and fiancé because well he passed away a week before proposing to me. I found the ring and his friends told me. So although he was never “officially” my fiancé, it’s just comforting. And I call my in laws my in laws because it helps with the word count.

AITA for refusing to answer to a nickname I don’t like?,"Throwaway account and fake names. I don’t think I’m TAH here but one of my coworkers does and we both follow this reddit, so we’re letting reddit decide. 

I (28F) was named after a really obscure character from Greek Mythology. My preferred nickname is taken from the end of my name. I always introduce myself with “I’m (my name) but you can call me (nickname).” None of my coworkers in the small business we work for have ever had a problem with this before, until Megan(25F), the niece of Jeff(50sM) one of the two owners, was hired. Jeff and Dave(50sM) co-own the business but Dave does the actual day to day running of the business. I introduced myself and my nickname as usual but she immediately said that “Bessie” (not the actual name) would be a better nickname because it comes from the beginning of my name and that she liked it better. I told her I really didn’t like that nickname and wouldn’t answer to it and asked her to please not call me Bessie but she insisted that it was so much prettier and that I just needed to get used to it.

For the next two months she tried to call me Bessie but I completely ignored her whenever she addressed me that way, even when I knew she really needed help with something. She would call my desk phone and say “hey Bessie” I would reply “you have the wrong number there’s no Bessie here” and hang up. She then tried to get some of the employees outside the office to start calling me Bessie, but I quickly shut that down. I usually finish my work early and help them with a lot of tedious little things that aren’t part of my job description and threaten to stop helping them unless they used my preferred nickname.

Friday she decided she was going to get me to respond to Bessie no matter what. We have an open office design but are at opposite ends. She started calling out Bessie in a singsong voice over and over again to try and annoy me enough to respond. Other coworkers got annoyed, most telling her to stop and one Lisa(43F) telling me to just let her call me Bessie already. I refused and she kept calling out Bessie louder and louder, until Dave barged in. He’d been on a conference call with an important client and could hear her yelling from his office down the hall. He told her to be quiet and that if she called me Bessie one more time, he’d write her up and dock her pay. 

Later, Megan cornered me in the break room, called me an AH for getting her in trouble and called me Bessie again for good measure just as Dave was walking in to heat up his lunch. He gave her a stern look and said “I warned you.” Then he walked to HR to have her written up. Lisa is saying I’m the AH for never helping Megan and that, if I had been nicer or hadn’t fought her so hard on the nickname, she probably would have given up on it a while ago but because I made such a big deal out of it, it became a challenge. So reddit, AITA?",22772,t28sn2,"Lisa thinks you should just give in and let the bully win?

AITA? For refusing to let MIL spend the night in my bedroom and lock the door?,"

Context: my husband (m34) and I (f26) got married 9 months ago, we live in a different town from his parents, and his mom visited us unexpectedly on friday. 

Now to give some context about my MIL, She is okay-ish but has no respect for her son's privacy and by extension, mine. 

When it was time to go to bed, MIL requested that we let her sleep in the bedroom, on the master bed, not just that but lock the door as well because she explained she can't feel comfortable enough to sleep without locking the door. I found this bizzare but I politely declined and suggeted other options like the guest room, couch and air mattress but no she turned around and presented these options to me. My husband agreed but I said no. This initiated an argument between her and I. During the argument I pointed put how I didn't want to be keot out of my room and away from my stuff but she lashed out at my husband saying ""Don't you just stand there! Say something!"". My husband told me to let her it's just one night, but I told her those were all the options I had for her and if she didn't like them then I could book her in a hotel. She took it as in I was kicking her out and started crying which made my husband upset. 

She left at 12am and my husband blew up saying I disrespected his mom who was a GUEST at our house and treated her poorly, he then reminded me it's our bedroom not just mine and I acted horribly to her causing her to go stay at a hotel in the middle of the night. He went to book a room in the same hotel as her and turned his phone off. The next day she went home and told the family who berated me calling my behavior towards MIL abhorrent and loathsome, now my husband is complaining about how I keep trying to ruin his relationship with his family and push them away.

AITA for demanding my son take his daughter on his family trip to Disneyland?,"I got pregnant with my son Julius (28) about a month after my 18th birthday. I tried to do my best for him and he got into a good engineering school but at 19, he got his then girlfriend Iza pregnant and they had Annabella together. I've been the one who has mostly raised her (Iza got deported but they spend July together and FT every night). Julius got married to his girlfriend Katja after graduation and they have two wonderful boys together. Annabella lives with me and not with them.

The thing is, Julius never spends any time with Annabella. He doesn't even call to say goodnight. But she loves him so much. It's like once a month, he'll show up with a box full of toys, spend a day with her and then go back to his family. It hurts her so much that he doesn't spend time with her because he's her hero. I'm just grandma. And no, he doesn't act this way because of his wife. Katja would love to have Annabella move in with them, she once brought up the idea and she went on about all the things they could do together. She would love to be her stepmom, calls her princess, sweetie and so many nice nicknames. The only reason they haven't is because Julius has said she should stay with me.

A few days ago, Julius told me that he and Katja were planning a trip to Disneyland in August. I told him that Annabella would be so excited and he should tell her on her birthday and he just blankly told me she's not coming and the trip is for his boys. I made it clear to him that he needed to bring her on the trip and he just called me an asshole - which he's never done before - for trying to control him.

AITA for telling my son i’d rather have his ex wife as a daughter than him as my son after he got cut out of the will?,"16 years ago my son Matthew had a daughter with his now ex wife Josie. I have always thought of Josie as my own daughter, so when they divorced 7 years ago due to my son cheating, I was conflicted and disappointed. Josie wasn’t particularly close with any of her family, so My husband and I naturally took them in. Josie was an angel, she had insisted that we didn’t have to lift a finger more than before we had taken them in and though she was hurt, she kept civil around Matthew.

My husband and I held a huge hand in raising their daughter Ruth, because Matthew remarried less than a year later and now has a four year old son after disowning Ruth. Two years ago my husband was diagnosed with lung cancer, it was hard on everyone, especially Ruth. They were extremely close, she told him about her girlfriends and boyfriends before anyone else and has always wanted him to be the one to walk her down the isle at her wedding. Matt rarely ever visited and didn’t answer our calls often saying that we had other kids so it wasn’t like my husband was dying lonely.

Last night Matt stopped by to talk about inheritance, he never mentioned Josie nor Ruth and hinted that he thought he should get more inheritance than his siblings the entire time. My husband and I shared awkward looks until he decided to cut in, he explained that everyone would get a piece, but he’d focus more on Ruth and Bonnie (one of our other grandkids). Matt got angry and said that Ruth was just a bastard and that his son deserved more than her, my husband got furious after that and left the room saying that he wouldn’t include Matthew at all. 

Matt yelled back and turned to me saying that Ruth wasn’t worth it because she’d just grow up to be a whore like her mother, I told him that i’d rather have her mother as my daughter than him as my son and insisted that he leave. I’m getting phone calls from Matt’s wife and family friends saying that my husband and I overreacted and he was just angry that we were playing favorites.

AITA?

EDIT: To clear some things up: Josie did not cheat on Matthew, Josie and Matthew met later in college and Josie was known as a “party girl” before that, Ruth isn’t the product of an affair but we are planning on getting a DNA test because what Matthew said has gotten under Ruth’s skin (she was at the house when this occurred and over heard it)

When it came to taking in Josie and Ruth we didn’t hesitate because Josie is not from here, she and Matt lived in another country until he moved them here a few months before he got caught cheating and they had no where else to go as Josie was a stay at home mom. i had no intentions of “choosing” Josie over Matt, then and now, and I never discouraged Matt from visiting, i tried to make it very clear that we weren’t picking and choosing when we took Josie in, we just wanted her and our granddaughter to be safe and have a good home.",22731,s8uw0w,"NTA.

AITA for yelling at my boyfriend for making me leave my best friend's wedding?,"

My boyfriend, 27, and I, 26 have been together for 2 years. He's a good heart and is normally rational but his one issue is that he expects to accompany me in every ocassion nomatter how big or small. He even went with me to my ex boyfriend's funeral after days of begging. 

Now my best friend got married few days ago, it was very small and only close family and friends were invited, My boyfriend couldn't come because of the + one rule. He pitched a hissy fit saying my best friend has no respect for my relationship and was shocked when he learned that I was still going to attend, He told me that if he can't go then I'm expected to not go as well but that is my best friend and I had to respect her rules. He gave me an altimatum either we go together or I stay home with him. I ended up going cause again I respected my friend's rules. He was angry with me and kept calling the entire 2hr drive then stopped. Later I got a text from his friend telling me he (my boyfriend) got into an accident and was taken to the hospital. I freaked out he gave me the address and I had to leave the wedding and told my friends why. 

I was a crying the entire drive home and kept calling his friend but got no response. I arrived to the hospital and asked about my boyfriend and they checked and told me he wasn't there, My anxiety reached 160% as I kept calling his friends one by one. I just went home and there he was...along with his friend. He saw me and said that he was sorry but this was the only he can get me home after I left him alone. After the initial shock I just blew up yelling at him about lying and making me leave my friend's wedding and having me literally go to the hospital and freaking out cause of him. I kicked his friend out and we got into an argument. He kept talking about how much I love him thus I left which is my own doing not his and he was just trying to see if I really chose my friend's wedding over him. He then argued that my friend caused this and I shouldn't agree with her to exclude him, I said what he did was horrible and called him horrible and then went to my room. It was awful cause my friends kept calling to check in on him cause they thought he was really at the hospital. He said I overreacted and that I yelled at the wrong person.

"AITA for telling my wife she was ""so close"" to getting her dream job?","I'm a 33-year-old man and my wife is 27.

Since the start of our relationship, my wife has been very particular about how things get done, and tends to believe that she knows the one true correct way for anything related to anything. She has admitted that she can be a control freak. While this bothers me, it has never been a true dealbreaker in our relationship.

Very often when I do just about anything, whether it be a household chore, assembling a piece of furniture, taking a picture, or writing a presentation for work (in a field where I have a master's degree and she has no formal education), she'll do this thing where she'll condescendingly say ""You were *so close* to getting it right,"" really drawing out the ""so close"" part. I've told her dozens of times that I'd prefer for her to stop because it sounds so condescending, but she insists that she's complimenting me.

I do the dishes and place them out to dry in an orientation she doesn't approve of?

>You were *so close*. Next time, put them that way.

I take a picture of her?

>You were *so close*. Next time, angle the camera this way.

I complete a project at work and show her the results?

>You were *so close*. Next time, write it this way.

For the last two months my wife has been undergoing an intensive hiring process for a job in our city. She works in a highly niche field and seldom finds job openings, and therefore she was ecstatic to have the opportunity for a relatively well-paying job doing what she wants to do. She got to the very final stage where the company was considering two people, coincidentally the other of whom was her college roommate. Well, on Friday she got ""the call"" telling her thanks for her application but blah blah blah, record on file, all that jazz.

My wife came to me crying. I immediately comforted her and ""You were *so close*"" blurted out. Her head whipped up and she asked what I meant by that. I said she was *so close* to getting the job, but was just a bit off. She immediately walked out to stay at her friend's house, where she is currently sulking. She finally sent me a text this afternoon calling me a huge jerk. 

Was I unnecessarily being an asshole here?",22686,y60dq7,"NTA

You just confirmed that every time she’s thrown that line at you, it was never meant as a compliment. She got a taste of her crappy medicine and didn’t like it.

AITA for saying no to picking up my sons half sister from school?,"I am a single mom of two boys ages 11 and 10. Their father and I divorced 5 years ago after I learned he was cheating on me. He got her pregnant either right before he told me, and that was why he confessed, or right after. But our divorce was not an easy one. He wanted to stay ""friends"" and I could not look at him after what he did. He and I were together for over 13 years, he was also a friend before he was my boyfriend/husband and to have him betray me like that and treat me as he had was awful.

He married his affair partner. They had a daughter within months of our separation, followed by a son after the divorce/their marriage. Last year they lost a baby which led to the discovery that his wife had cancer.

What followed was a lot of fighting between the two of us again. He wanted me to help him and his wife out. He said their children (who are currently 5 and 3) needed family beyond just him and his wife. His own family disowned him for our divorce (they were extremely religious) and she has no family. I told him it would be over my dead body I would help him. He argued that it was for the children and if not for his kids with her, then for our boys, who could see their family heal and be one. I told him he stopped any chance of that happening when he cheated on me.

What I did not expect was for him to tell his daughter's school to call me when she got sick. He was at work at the time and couldn't leave apparently because he had already missed a lot of work due to his wife, and she was home recovering from chemo. I got the call, was asked if I would pick her up and I said no. Several hours later I got reamed on the phone by him for leaving his sick child at school when I knew they had nobody. This is when he told me how he couldn't leave and how his wife was resting. I told him the babysitter for his son should have been called over me. He told me he was in daycare and I should be fucking ashamed because she was a sick child who is going through a lot and I could have helped. He told me he hoped our son's were going to be fucking ashamed of me. They aren't. And I argued back with him over the phone at the time.

But I guess part of me does feel bad for the child. My son's also sensed an atmosphere while they were with their dad after the incident when they talked about me, and I hate that for them.

>He argued that it was for the children and if not for his kids with her, then for our boys, who could see their family heal and be one.

AITA for telling my estranged sister and our parents that she and her kids are not my problem?,"7 years ago I was married and expecting a baby when things went horribly wrong. Around 10 weeks into my pregnancy I suffered a miscarriage and then I returned home to find my husband in bed with my sister. The two of them tried to apologize and convince me that we could all get over it. But I wanted nothing to do with either of them and even less so when I found out she had gotten pregnant. My divorce was finalized quickly because I wanted nothing from him other than the divorce and was willing to leave the marriage with nothing but the clothes on my back. 

Pretty early I realized my parents were hoping I would want to still be part of the baby's life but I wanted nothing to do with the baby my sister conceived while sleeping with my husband (now ex) as I lay in hospital losing my own pregnancy. I refused any and all contact with my sister and ex. They married and had two more children after the one she concieved during my marriage to him.

I met my current husband when I had distanced myself from my whole family and he was amazing and his family were great. We got married two years ago and his family are nothing short of the best. I adore the nieces and nephews I have gained through my marriage to him and we spend a lot of time together.

Around three months ago my sister called me at work (using my work phone) and told me she needed me and could I please come to her. I hung up the phone and continued about my day. It was several hours later that I got a message from my parents saying I needed to be with my sister. A few days later I got another call and was told my sister had been pregnant, the baby passed away inside of her and she delivered a stillborn all while he was out sleeping with someone else. My parents and sister expected me to rally around her and I didn't. Now that some time has passed and she lives with them, I have been inundated with them saying I should meet her kids, be there for them like I am my husband's nieces and nephews and that I should reconcile with the family. My sister told me how sorry she was again and that she wanted us to make up. I told the three of them that she and her kids are not my problem and I still want nothing to do with them.

My parents are furious and they say I need to forgive because whatever she did, she is now suffering worse than would ever be deserved and her kids are innocent and deserve an aunt.

AITA for prioritizing my son's dog over my wife's pregnancy?,"When my son (14) was eight, we got a dog. He's half Great Dane and half some dog my friend's dog met during an unauthorized absence. My son loves this dog and does all the care for him (except vet stuff) and is a very responsible dog owner. This dog is pretty much his best friend.

My wife is 12 weeks pregnant, and ever since we confirmed the pregnancy she has been acting weird around the dog. She avoids him, puts her hands over her stomach when he is around and jolts whenever he makes noise. Today she told me she wants to re-home the dog. I asked her what she was talking about.

She said she has been having anxiety that he will jump on her. This is completely unreasonable. He doesn't jump on people. We trained him not to jump on people or run into people very young because he is half Great Dane and I felt this was important for all dogs, but especially one who could possibly grow to such a large size (which he did). There is no reason for her to think the dog will jump on her.

She said that there is no way to know for sure that the dog won't jump on her, and if he does our baby could be hurt. This dog has never so much as growled at her. She said even if the dog doesn't jump on her, her anxiety about it is bad for her health. She said she needs the dog elsewhere for her safety and the baby's.

I told her that there was no way. My son got this dog right after he lost his mom and imprinted on him hard. Sometimes I think he loves the dog more than me! I'm not taking his dog. The dog didn't do anything!

My wife said I am prioritizing the dog over her pregnancy. The dog isn't a threat to her pregnancy. If this were any other unreasonable request, I would just do it because she is pregnant. I just can't break my son's heart over a fear she has that makes no sense. Am I being an asshole?",22656,104hya7,"NTA. Don’t you dare give away you son’s dog.

AITA for leaving in the middle of celebration because of the toast my husband gave?,"

I f25 married my husband m31 3 years ago. I'm currently pregnant with our first baby together. We found out it's a girl and my inlaws wanted to invite us for dinner for ""gender reveal announcement and celebration"".

We got there, saw many relatives coming to congrat us and celebrate. It was bigger than expected which made me nervous because I'm not a fan of being around many people.


We sat at dinner table and I barely ate, I was feeling so much anxiety and was sort of upset my husband didn't warn me about how many people were coming, but I tried to stay calm and collected. Anyways, after the announcement and in the middle of the celebration my husband wanted to give a toast. He opened a bottle and poured a drink and wished that our daughter be ""healthy, happy, but look nothing like me"". Everyone at the table laughed. I sat there staring in shock while he kept laughing with them. I felt so much rage and my anxiety got out of hand ngl. I got up, took my purse and made my way out. His mom followed me asking if I was okay,  I told her I just wanted tk go home. He came to the door asking what was wrong that's when we started arguing. He said this was a ""joke toast"" and that my reaction was over the top, but the thing is eversince i got pregnant he kept hinting he doesn't want our daughter to look like me. He even once got up in the morning and first thing he told me was how much he wished our daughter look nothing like me. It hurt me while I'm already dealing with low self esteem and anxiety. I wanted to go home but he said I was being a baby and that I should learn to take a ""fucking"" joke. I said he made everyone laugh at me buy he defensively said it didn't warrant me to walk out of dinner and be so disrespectful to the re,ative who came to celebrate and share our joy.

I went home and he called many times telling me to get my ""insecurities"" in check before j pass them up to our daughter, he urged me to get therapy and stop acting so dramatically like how I did infront of his family.

Any idea why he was being cruel?  If he really doesn’t like your looks, then why did he tie you down from finding someone who *will* appreciate you?

AITA for bluntly telling a woman it’s dangerous to put essential oils in sensitive areas?,"My uncle’s new girlfriend came to family dinner the other night and it was the first time anyone in my family met her.

But then she brought up that they can be super good for yeast infections!!? I looked at her super horrified and asked “you mean you’re putting them *down there*??” And she said yes you just insert a few drops and it clears up right away! I told her this was very dangerous and could cause chemical burns as well as throwing off your vaginal ph and potentially causing other infections. She said “oh no you don’t have to worry about that they’re all natural!!” To which I replied “so is poison ivy but I wouldn’t suggest shoving it up your vagina.” She just looked kind of shocked. My sister laughed and my aunt said “well she has a point,” but other family members said that it was rude and crass.

AITA for laughing hysterically after a date kept insisting to me that women have periods from their butts?,"Throwaway. There was this guy(22M) who I(20F) have gone on a few dates with in the past couple of months. He's nice and so far we've only progressed to going on public dates, but about a week ago we finally decided to have a nice date at my place. Since it was going to be at my place I let him know before that I was on my period because I wasn't sure what expectations he had or where his boundaries were yet, and we agreed to just have a nice takeout dinner and watch a movie.

He comes over and we eat then sit down on the couch to pick a movie when he says that it sucked that I was on my period Then he said how he thought it was so strange that women give birth through the vagina but have periods from their butts. (This was a completely unpromoted statement from him and I'm still not sure how we got on the topic tbh) I asked him what he meant by that and he said again exactly what he had said before. I kind of smiled, assuming he was very much just joking, and said ""oh yeah, so weird"" thinking that he was going to start laughing soon to end the joke. He didn't, and instead started to talk about his first and only girlfriend he'd had in high school and how she used to complain about bad ""period poops"" all the time. At this point I ask him if he is being serious and he looks a little confused and says he is.

I ask him to explain how he came to that conclusion and he explained that his first experience being around periods was the hs gf and before then he had never received or seen much information. He understood it was something that happened inside the body and that blood came out ""somewhere"" but assumed it came out of the vagina until he heard her complaining and realized it actually came out of the butt. It was very unexpected coming from a 22 year old man. I somehow managed to keep my composure when I told him that periods do in fact come out of the vagina and not butts.

He looked confused and then a little frustrated and started insisting to me that was wrong and then kept saying ""are you sure?"" as if I was confused about where it came out of my own body. I explained to him the anatomy a bit and how it worked but he was very adamant. Eventually he conceded that most women must have periods like that, but some, hence his ex-gf, have their periods form their butts. He just could not understand no matter how many times I tried to explain it to him that he had just simply come to the wrong conclusion and misinterpreted his gf's words. The whole situation became so much that I started to laugh. I was doubled over, clutching my stomach, crying laughing over this whole debacle, and he sat there red-faced, continuing to try and argue with me. Eventually he said he was ready to leave and did before we could watch a movie. I felt bad for laughing after he left because I could tell that had been when he decided to leave and he also texted me later that night to say he had done a little bit of research ""on his own"" and that he was no longer interested in pursuing any sort of relationship because he couldn't stand to be with someone who laughed at someone for ""not understanding"".

I was watching my nieces while dinner was getting ready, we sat down and I happened to sit next to brother in law. I was wearing a skirt and it was accidentally lifted above my knee, my brother in law looked down at my leg and made face then loudly said ""Oh shooo, Op! This is gross, you should've shaved, that hair isn't supposed to be there"". Everyone stared, I told him ""if it's not supposed to be there then why does it grow there, can you explain?"" He was like ""it's just not supposed to be there"", I point at his mustache and say ""well, guess the same thing can be said about your little mustache then, huh?"". He looks at meeyes wide open, and awkward silence takes over though some laughed. My sister told me to knock it off as my brother in law got up from his chair and went inside the bathroom.

AITA for leaving a bad review on a small store,"So my boyfriend and I have a tradition for our anniversary that we each go to a store and separate, and after we buy each other gifts we exchange in the car. It’s silly and cute.

We walked into this new mom & pop anime store (I am a huge anime nerd and my boyfriend likes video games which they also sell)


We separate and I go look at stuff for my boyfriend. A worker walks up to me and starts chatting, then points at my leg. I have a pretty big tattoo of Kakashi from Naruto on my thigh, among other anime tattoos. 

He asks if I got that for my boyfriend and I said no, I’ve always loved Naruto and then showed him my other tattoos which included the leaf village symbol, Gaara of the sands gourd, and a piece on my arm of Asuma Sarutobi.

He started quizzing me on the lore of the anime and I told him I wouldn’t have spent $1000 on tattoos of an anime I didn’t know about, and I didn’t appreciate him trying to catch me in a “Gotcha” moment. 


He told me he didn’t believe a girl could ever fully understand the real story of Naruto and the depth behind it (lol) 


I told him I didn’t need his services and he can go back to the front desk. He told me I was a “rude wannabe bitch” and walked into the back and I continued purchasing my items. 

I left a review later, TLDR: if you’re feminine presenting enter with caution, one of the employees will call you a bitch when you don’t want to prove your “nerd cred” to him.

AITA for telling my SIL that I will call the cops for child abandonment the moment she steps out of the house?,"Me(25M), my brother Jack(27M) and his wife Jill(25F).

It all started when Jack and Jill got pregnant. Their lease almost ended and my parents invited them to stay at our house.
The day they came, Jack asked me why I haven't moved out of my room yet. I was confused, like wtf, and he told me that he and Jill will be at my room and I go to guest room. I refused, but my parents got mad, we got into a fight, I lost and ended in much smaller guest room.

Then Jill had a problem with my cooking. I eat scrambled eggs with mozzarela and avocado every day for breakfast and she couldn't stand the smell. She asked me to stop, I refused, my parents got involved, I had to stop. There were problems with other food too, and I had to stop cooking them. I was told I must be more accomodating cause she pregnant. Like that is my problem.
Then Jill started to boss me around. We were alone for 8 hours while my parents and Jack worked. She obviously tought I will be her personal maid. I refused, she trew a temper tantrum, like always, and I again
had big fight with Jack and my parents. I was told that she had a high risk pregnancy and was on bed rest, and I'm an asshole for not helping her. I told Jack that he knocked her up, it's his responsibility. I stood my ground and in the end Jill's cousin came to help her sometimes.

Than Jill gave birth to my nephew. I congratulated them when they came home, and that is it. I don't like babies, so I mostly keep for myself now. But that doesn't stop Jill to ask for favors. Please watch the baby while a take quick shower, please watch it while I make myself some food, etc.. I always refuse and we all have new fights over and over again.
It all came to head last Friday when she asked me to watch my nephew while she goes to pharmacy for baby formula. I refused. She got mad and we had a fight. She grabed her purse to go anyway and I told her, that the moment she walks out that door I will call the police for child abandonment. I was serious and she knew it. She broke down and screamed what a horrible human being I am, then she ran to her room. She had complete mental breakdown.

When Jack and my parents came home we had the biggest fight yet. Jack accused me of hating Jill and my nephew, upon other things. I told him I refuse to bond because they will weaponize him against me. My parents told me enough is enough. That they can't believe they raised such a selfish human being.

I've had her for 3 years and since then haven't taken any vacations or trips away as it would be too disruptive for her. She distrusts everyone and is very reliant on her routine. I love her deeply and I'm happy to make sacrifices for her. They are permanent toddlers and very intelligent birds.

I met my husband by the time his kids were older, my stepdaughter was 16 at the time. We married when she moved away for college. Nevertheless I thought we'd managed to have a decent relationship, until now... my stepdaughter is getting married in March, and naturally there's a lot of preparation involved. They're wanting a huge traditional wedding and she is stressed out of her mind. They live out of state, and she invited me recently to come visit her for a week to help make wedding plans and spend time with their 2yo. I declined and she insisted to know why, acting very hurt, and I explained the parrot... Well jt all went downhill from there. 

She caused a massive fuss with her dad, saying she never got a mother figure and I never accepted her as my full blood daughter and this is the ultimate snub for a silly animal. That I'm cold and emotionless... I feel really hurt and I can tell he agrees with her even though he's refusing to take sides. But I don't see why I should be expected to take holiday time off work to babysit and ""bond"" all of a sudden and I don't see how I'm a monster for this... am I the asshole here?

Edit: context of our relationship, we don't usually talk at all and she hasn't visited home in 4 years.

Edit 2: Beginning to think it was maybe a mistake posting this. Mostly because this is a real and nuanced situation and reddit is no place for nuance, and maybe personal relationships shouldn't be judged in the AH context in the first place. But also because I should be more understanding and a bigger person regardless of who is or isn't the asshole. Life is too short to be butthurt and offended.

I called my stepdaughter and told her that I understand this is a big moment in her life and she wants someone there to help and support her, and that I'm still willing to help her in any way I can to plan the wedding via zoom and virtually. We talked a bit and I asked her why she hadn't accepted me reaching out in the past and she apologised and said she didn't want to accept someone as a stand-in, ""fake"" replacement for her bio mom, but now she regrets it and would like a closer relationship, especially seeing how close her SO is with his mom. We ended the conversation positively and I'm hoping things can improve going forward. I told her I'm a crazy bird lady and asked her if she still wants a relationship knowing that and she said that after the wedding she's willing to travel to visit us if we have room... which we do. I'll leave this post up but I'm happy either way and I'm glad the feedback here motivated me to make the call.",22405,10dttwx,"INFO:  How are you going to attend an out-of-state wedding in March, if you can't leave the state in January?

AITA for refusing to let my daughter do an after school detention and threatening to pick her up?,"My daughter Amanda (F13) has Cerebral Palsy. She is able to walk independently but cannot walk for long periods of time and cannot walk on anything other than even ground without assistance (i.e stairs have to have rails, can't walk on rocks/sand/etc). She has an IEP for this - that states what she can and cannot do in PE, excursions, etc. It's relevant to note that Amanda catches the bus home - but can only catch a specific route as the other route the school offers drops her off at a road about a mile away that has no footpath.

I got a call at work at 11am today telling me that Amanda had spoken quite rudely to a substitute PE (gym) teacher who tried to make her climb the rock wall that her school has. Apparently Amanda did say ""I can't, I have Cerebral Palsy and I have an IEP"" but when another child said ""Yeah! Same here!"" the teacher didn't believe her and became insistent - standing over her so Amanda told him to ""fuck off"" and wouldn't repeat anything but ""fuck off"" until she was sent to the office.

It is in the handbook that this type of offence is a same day after school detention. But when the Principal called me I said ""absolutely not"". I told them that they were welcome to do a weeks worth of lunch detentions, or even schedule it so that I can change my work schedule - but absolutely not this afternoon. My husband is away for work, I have to work until 6pm and I need Amanda to be on her regular bus because I have nobody who can drop her off home at 4:30 when detention finishes. They told me about the ""late"" bus and I reminded them why Amanda couldn't take that bus and was told ""well, sounds like a natural consequence to me"". This isn't your average kid refusing to do something, being rude and deserving a long walk home as well as detention. This is a kid that could be seriously harmed if she was made to walk that far and on that road.

The Principal told me that I was ""making excuses"" and that Amanda needed to face consequences and I didn't technically need to give permission - they were making me aware. I agree that Amanda needs to face consequences for her language (which are that ~~she's grounded for the weekend~~, and has to serve any lunch detention the school gives her and apologising to the teacher for specifically her language - nothing else) - but putting her in danger is NOT right and that if they were insistent on this - I was insistent on taking my lunch break right now to drive over and pull her out for the rest of the day. (EDIT: The school called back and said she had 2 days of lunch detention - but my sister who lives interstate thinks I'm being one of ""those"" mums and told me I was in the wrong, hence posting) AITA?

Edit to update: I have since ungrounded Amanda and apologised and told her that I acted irrationally out of stress and anger at the school in the situation. I also told her it's up to her regarding the apology.

Holy shit, the PE teacher needs to face consequences for THEIR behavior. I would not be talking to the principal about this because said principal seems incompetent. I would be calling the SCHOOL BOARD and reporting everyone and their mother for this behavior. 

They tried to force your daughter to climb a rock wall because they didn’t believe her when she said she has an IEP. That’s INSANE. Imagine how many other kids they’re pulling that shit on??

AITA for calling police on a neighbour after she keyed my car because of books I write,"I am a single woman in my early 30s, making my living writing and self-publishing adult fiction. By adult fiction, I mean, ADULT fiction with majority of the ‘plot’ being steamy. I don’t typically tell people what I write but I do tell them I write books for a living under a pen name (and if you’re questioning my writing abilities, I have an editor to correct my mistakes). I am not hiding it per se but I am not telling everyone I meet what I do for a living and none of my neighbours knew, only a bunch of friends.

I live in a house alone, pretty much of all my neighbours are either young families or retired couples. My next door neighbour is a young couple. We’ve been polite to each other but haven’t been close or anything.

Lately, the husband, let’s call him Roger, became very friendly towards me which I tried to ignore but he’s been getting too flirty for my liking, and I started avoiding him.

They had a BBQ over the bank holiday weekend, and I was taking rubbish out to put in my bin, Roger looked at me, waved ‘hi’ and whispered something to his friend and they both watched me very carefully which was incredibly creepy.

On my way through my garden, I saw Roger’s wife (Dalia) leaving the house with her friend and they both looked at me with disgust and whispered something to each other. It was weird and I hurried back inside.


The next morning, I found some religious leaflets put through my letter box. They were just printed on normal printer paper and were warning about lustful behaviour leading to hell, etc. Threw them away but kept finding similar leaflets put through my letter box for the next week.   

Since I am working from home, I decided to see who’s leaving those leaflets and to my surprise, it was Dalia. I decided to confront her and ask to stop putting religious leaflets through my door. Despite me being polite, she was not happy. She told me that I should rethink my life because what I write is disgusting (it’s pretty vanilla) and she found her husband reading it at night and you can imagine doing what. She kept going on and on how I am going to burn in hell, how I have no morals, etc. Well, I told her to stay away from me and discuss this with her husband and I closed the door in her face. Don’t know who, but someone told them what I do for a living. 
A day later, I found the word ‘sl*t’ painted on my door. A few days later, I caught her keying my car, she was almost done with the word ‘wh*re.’ Well, I called the police on her and since I installed cameras after the ‘sl*t’ incident, she is being taken to court over keying my car.

I talked to my other neighbour (she asked about the police) about it and she told me that I went overboard, that Dalia was clearly insecure but she’s a lovely woman and great mother and I should have talked to her instead of calling the police and give her a chance to change her behaviour. AITA for calling the police and not giving Dalia a chance?",22334,ul1d7q,"NTA.

You *did* talk to Dalla.  You *did* give her a chance.

AITA for eating my cupcake outside?,"I have a 10 years old daughter who loves frosting. Every week I buy cupcakes for me, my wife and her and she always eats my frosting. These past few weeks I decided to eat my cupcake before going inside. She asked me where my cupcake is and I told her I don't like cupcakes anymore so I only bought two. It worked for a while but last night when I was enjoying my cupcake before going inside she caught me and ran to her mom to tell her how much of a Terrible dad I am to ""steal her frostings for weeks""

She is sulking and my wife thinks I'm the ah and I'm acting childish and should just let her have it but it's easy for her to say when she has never given up HER frosting. AITA?

Edit: everyone is taking this very seriously lol. My daughter is not an entitled spoiled brat. Honestly I think she doesn't even love frosting that much she only does it to annoy me. I made this post because my wife likes this sub so I wanted to show her that I'm not the ah

Edit2: a lot happened since I posted here.

My wife is getting a divorce. She says she can't live with a liar. Cps came to our home to take our child away. They said we are terrible parents for letting our child eat frosting but by the time they got here our daughter wasn't home why? Because the cops came and arrested her for stealing a car. They said frosting thieves always become car thieves so there is no need waiting. She should go to jail asap. When she got there she called me and said she is going nc because I lied to her and she can't trust me anymore. Meanwhile we are getting calls from her friends telling us horror stories about our daughter bullying them. Our life is ruined. All because of a cupcake

Nahhh lol

So my daughter and I had a serious conversation about this problem and we came to an agreement. She said she'll stop stealing my frostings if I stop stealing her chips so we're good

AITA for being hostile and rude to my sister's boyfriend over a joke he told my wife?,"
My sister (26) brought her new boyfriend (30) over to our parents house to meet him for the first time, My wife and I came as well.


We met the dude, he seemed ok-ish at first but he then started asking weird and personal questions. My wife had a breast cancer and got a single mastectomy last year. She told the story to my sister's boyfriend and he was like ""oh"" then he stared at my wife briefly then ""playfully"" said ""without even asking, I can pretty much tell which one got the blow"". We were floored, My wife could barely keep a straight face. she lied so she could leave the table cause she was literally about to tear up. I just looked at the dude and said ""Are you serious?"" he said ""What??!! I was just joking bro"" I started asking him to explain the joke to me, He just stared. I asked him again to explain it to me in details but still got no answer. My sister asked me to stop because clearly he got uncomfortable, but I insisted he explain the joke to me cause clearly....my wife and I didn't get it. Things got awkward with him avoiding eye contact while I just stared at him the entire time. I still insisted and asked him to explain the joke right there and then, but seconds later he said he needed to step outside to make a phone call. turns out he got in his car and left. My sister had a meltdown screaming and berating me for how I treated her boyfriend. Calling me hostle with anger issues to scare her boyfriend out of our parents house. I told her he was overstepping and made my wife uncomfortable to the point of crying, She actually called me wife ""such a princess"" and said she is soft and can not take some teasing. I had an argument with her and my parents intervened, I took my wife and left.


My dad called me later and said that he understood how hurt my wife felt but my sister's boyfriend was visiting for the first time and I showed hostility and agression instead of just ignoring him. He encouraged me to reach out to him and my sister later and talk it out but I declined.

AITA? Edit: My sister and my wife don't have a history but my sister tends to ""see"" the worst in people. When my wife announced her diagnosis, my sister actually thought she was ""faking"" because the family no longer brought up my wife's miscarriage months prior, I thought that was out of line and she apologized for it and we moved on.

AITA for grounding my 16yro son for a month after he called his stepdad a slur?,"I'm 43M, my son is 16M. I'm divorced (have been for a few years now) and my ex remarried recently. 

Her new husband (Jonathan) is black (we're white). He and my ex are now expecting a baby together. He also has 2 teenage boys himself. 

My ex and I share custody, but our son spends most of his time at my plase because he has more room and privacy here. 

Last weekend he was at his mom's and on Sunday, he called me all upset saying to come pick him up. I rushed over there and found out that he got into a fight with Jonathan over some chores and Jonathan locked him out of wifi and banned him from video games until he does his chores (which is how my ex and I also discipline him, and Jonathan has our permission to do the same if my son acts out - he can use the same methods he uses with his sons). More longterm/serious punishments are of course decided between my ex and I, but ""no video games today"" type of thing is totally fine for Jonathan to do. 

My ex and Jonathan then told me that my son got all upset over this punishment and told Jonathan to "" f*ck off"". Jonathan then told him to stop talking like that, to which my son replied ""you and your sons ruined my life, so you dont get to tell me what to do. I want take orders from a N anyway"". 

I asked my son if this is all true. He said yes. He actually called him the N word (because ""well isnt it true""). 

I lost it and told my son he is grounded for the whole month of December. My ex agreed. He is obviously annoyed and angry, because he had tons of plans with his friends. 

He said that I am overreacting to one word and am being unfair. My brother and mom agree with my son, and are saying that the punishment doesn't fit the crime.

AITA for holding my son's college fund hostage?,"I(48M) have a son that graduated this year from highschool.

We (my wife and I) started his college fund the minute we found out she was pregnant. Since we make good money (in the mid 6 figures), his college fund currently has almost $400k in it.

We have never told our son what to do with his life. We may have guided his decisions as any good parent should, but since he was still young we let him make his own decisions.

We also never expected academic excellence or forced him into sports or artistic activities.

Now that he graduated highschool, he said that he did not want to go to college. We said as long as he was sure, he could whatever he wanted. He refused trade schools too. He also did not want to work with us in our business.

He said that he planned to use his college fund to start a business of his own. I said that I will allow it only if he takes some Business Management, accounting and law classes in the nearby community college. I said that I would pay them out of pocket and not from the fund. And then I would expect a well made business plan before I would give him the money. My wife agrees 100%.

But he called us AHs for holding his college fund hostage to make him do what we want. We think we are just doing our best to make sure that his business succeeds.

So AITA?

Edit: Oh wow! I logged off 5 minutes after posting, logged back in expecting maybe 100 comments at most. Thank you everyone, I read every single one and decided to answer the most relevant questions here.

So the money is in my and my wife's name.
 
Some people said that this discussion should have been had earlier, well earlier he said he wanted to take a couple years off to work before going to college. It wasn't until earlier last week that he said he wanted to start a business.

Some people also say that he is spoiled and doesn't know how fast that money can disappear, and they are right. I ran away from an abusive home at 16, worked for my FIL and got paid under the table untill I was able to work legally. The only reason I have the money I do is that married the boss' daughter and her father left us a paid off house and a booming business (he moved to spain to enjoy retirement). I didn't even get my GED and go to college untill I had my kid. So I spoiled my kid like I wish I was spoiled.

That is also the reason why I asked, I live in fear of doing something that could make me like my parents, and I know this community is full of younger people who might give me a different perspective. So thank you everyone.",22322,vwuiw6,"NTA.

"AITA for telling the new neighbors that they got what they paid for, including being shunned by the neighborhood?","Where I live, real estate developers have started snatching up family homes, bulldozing them and building enormous 2 million dollar houses on the plots of land. The houses also stick out horribly in terms of aesthetics – think single level brick homes with a 3-level gigantic white and black box in the middle.

My home’s been in my family for several generations. We have always been known for having a large, beautiful garden. We invited over kids to help with gardening, we gave away so many veggies, we’d hold parties, etc. It’s been a neighborhood treasure for years.

Until developers snatched up the lot next door, bulldozed and erected an enormous house that blocked out the light to most of the garden. Many of us tried to fight it with the city but everything was denied. It was heartbreaking. Our neighborhood has been changed forever. This was a link to my family and I almost have had to go through a grieving process for it.

The new owners moved in and were not welcomed warmly by people in the neighborhood. I avoided them for as long as I could, other than politely waving or nodding. It was a young couple in their early 20s.

We finally came face to face and the woman asked if we could chat. She said that they felt like maybe they’d done something wrong when they moved in, or if they aren’t pulling in their trash bins or something, being too loud, etc, because people haven’t been very friendly. The guy says that he’s surprised considering it felt like a “nice” and somewhat “affluent” neighborhood, and given the price, he was expecting friendly neighbors.

I asked if they had done any research about the area. They said that they moved from California, so no. I said that maybe that was their mistake?

They said they didn’t know what I meant, so I asked if they’d ever looked in our backyard. They said yes and said they think the garden is cute.

I said “Yes, the garden that now has about half less sunlight than before that house was built was a neighborhood treasure.""

The guy said “Well it’s not our fault you built the garden there, is it?”

I said “Well, you guys got what you paid for. 2 million dollars for a house that everyone in the neighborhood hates.” I said that I hoped it was worth it and wished them a nice day.

When I told another neighbor about the exchange, she told me that she does feel bad for them moving without having any idea what they were getting themselves into.

AITA for losing it on my fiancé for disinviting my stepsisters from our wedding?,"

I'm gonna keep it short. I f25 am getting married to my fiance next month, We've had no issues with the wedding planning except the ""guest list"". Context: I have a large family, I have 2 stepsisters (18, 20) and a biological brother (27) and also a biological sister (30). My fiance argued that the guest list should be cut short and suggested I only invite my ""immeditate family"", I asked him to elaborate and he suggested excluding my stepsisters. I said no and got upset with him for implying that they're not family, he said ""well, This wasn't what I meant..I was just speaking from a technical angle"", especially since I didn't include them in the wedding party like MOH and bridesmaids. So he thought they were""unneeded"" but I said they are wanted, and will always be wanted and included by me. Well, days ago, my stepsisters called saying my fiancé cancelled their invitations and told them some lie about changing wedding location and telling them they won't be able to come. I was fuming, I went home and started screaming at him, He asked that I hear him out then explained he had no choice since we were required to shorten the list, and he just did my ""dirty work for me"" since I obviously was looking at the situation from an ""emotional angle"" and couldn't bring myself to disinvite my stepsisters myself. I called him a hypocrite cause he invited almost 6 of his friends who, as far as I know, aren't immediate family. I told him he hurt my stepsisters by going behind my back and excluding them from  y wedding which they've been so excited about. He got up from the couch and yelled that it's our wedding so my stepsisters feelings aren't really that relevant compared to H.I.S and called me controlling for wanting my way or the highway.

AITA for not going to my mom’s house for Christmas and refusing to make my little sister go too?,"I’m 17 and my little sister is 15. Our dad died about 10 years ago. It was sudden and devastating. One day he kissed and hugged me and sis and told us he loved us and then we never heard from him again. At the time I couldn’t fully grasped why he chose to stay away even though mom tried to explain it to us. I missed him and thought I did something wrong to make dad mad. I repeatedly called his phone hoping he would answer but it always went directly to his voicemail.

At his funeral, I realized I would never see him again and I broke down. I don’t remember much from that day except Uncle David held me the entire time. He held me throughout the funeral, during the drive home, and as I fell asleep that night. Uncle Alan did the same thing with sis.

It wasn’t easy growing up with just my mom and sis but not as tough as it could have been because the two uncles were always a phone call away. Whenever we needed help with school, one of the uncles was there to tutor us. One of them was always in the front row of every school performance and game. Whenever I wake up in the middle of the night and miss dad, I’ll call Uncle David and know he’ll always pick up.

My mom eventually remarried to Bob. I never liked Bob because he always have to be in control and placed us on a strict schedule. Dinner was at 7 everyday no matter what. If we came home late and dinner was over, we weren’t allowed to eat that night. Whenever our uncles gave me and sis money, we had to give it to Bob and he divided the money equally.

A couple of months ago, sis and I were eating with Uncle David and his family. Our dinner conversation eventually led to where I want to go for college and how to pay for it. Uncle David told me that the uncles decided long ago they were going to pay for me and sis’s tuition and cost of living on campus. I cried when I heard that and laughed when he jokingly said he hope I don’t get into medical school because that’s going to cost him a fortune.

I went home and excitedly told mom and Bob that the uncles are going to pay for our colleges. Instead of being happy, they both looked furious and Bob started screaming about how unfair it was to our step siblings and half sister that we’re getting a free ride through college. He wanted me to tell our uncles to divided the college funds equally among the kids but I refused. The next day he kept on screaming at us so sis and I packed our bags to go to Uncle David’s house. He kept on screaming and even followed us out to my car.

Sis and I have been living Uncle David and his family ever since. This feels more like home that it ever did at our house. Mom has been asking us to come home for Christmas for a month now and I’ve been refusing. Today is the 24th and she’s been calling all morning crying and saying how we need to spend Christmas with family.

AITA for locking the door to prevent my husband from getting involved in my job interview?,"

I (/F33) am unemployed but God knows I had been looking for jobs (I'm a sale's rep) for well over 5 months, right after I recovered from my knee surgery.

My husband has a high paying job, first he suggested I leave my career as sales rep behind [not up to his wealthy family's standards, they'd mocked me for it a lot] and stay home but I refused because I love my job and want to grow in it. he suggested he finds me a better job since he has connections but that's not in my field.

I've had several job interviews and my husband has ruined all of them for me and here's how: he'd walk into the room whenever I'm having a potential job interview and introduce himself and take over the conversation with the interviewer, he'd tell them about how good I am but slip in some bad stuff that eventually cost me the job. His argument was that he's just making ""recommandations"" since he's connections and ""influence"" but I told him to stop and let me handle it. He sulked saying he was just trying to ""guide me"" and whatnot.

Several days ago, I'd gotten a job interview and after getting inside the room and before the interview started I locked the door. My husband tried to come in and started knocking on the door asking why I was locking the door and telling me to let him in. I put my headphones on and used noise cancelling but he kept knocking telling me to open the door.

After the interview was over I unlocked the door and walked out. He went off on me calling me disrespectful and awful to lock him out like that. I said I was sorry I wanted to work for this company so badly and I couldn't let him ruin it for me. He got offended and said that I was being petty and childish and also ungrateful because of the stunt I pulled and said that he was trying to help me get the best deal out there.

AITA for leaving dinner at my husband's family's house over a comment he made about my miscarriage?,"


My husband and I have been trying to have kids for 3 years. I've had a series of MCs and not a single pregnancy was successful. Our recent MC was a month ago. And although my husband never said anything (up until now) These have such trying to times for me personally, the tension and emotions are very overwhelming and I've become too sensitive even at the mention of the topic.


He took me to his family's house for dinner last night and my MC was brought up by his mom. The look of disappointment on her face made me lose my appetite completely. She went on and on about what may have caused it then my husband chimed in and said that he's starting to come to a conclusion that ""maybe I'm 'incapable' of being a mom"" I was floored for two reasons. One is that he'd even say such thing. Two is that no doctor has told me that there was something wrong with me specifically so for him to declare I was ""incapable"" of bearing children and being a mom hurt like a sting. I looked at him and he was like ""what???"" Then told me to not get offended since he was just being honest. He said he loves me and thinks I'm perfect but still thinks that ""I'm flawed in that area"" referring to motherhood.

AITA for refusing to take my daughter to my ex husband’s wedding?,"My (42F) ex husband (45M) and I were together for 20 years. We had a beautiful daughter together, Joceline (14F). We got a divorce 5 years ago due to infidelity on his part. I was devastated. He was the love of my life and he betrayed all of the trust and loyalty we had built up. To make matters worse, he ended up in a relationship with the woman he cheated on me with. They got engaged one year later and are set to be married in two weeks. Honestly, I still am heartbroken over my divorce. It’s hurtful to me that we were together for 20 years, and he could just go fall in love with someone else, as if I was nothing. However, Joceline was only 9 when we divorced, and he’s a great father so I would never want to come in between their bond. Joceline loves his fiancée as she’s very sweet to her, but she doesn’t know the reason why her dad and I divorced, I want to tell her when she’s a bit older and he doesn’t want to tell her at all. Anyways, I compromised with him that Joceline could come to the wedding, but that he would have to provide the transportation to and from the wedding, as I want no part of it. I don’t want to drop my daughter off at his wedding, I don’t want to see all the decorations and the happy guests, it’d just be too much for me. I didn’t tell him all of that obviously, but he agreed.

Today he calls me and asks if he can ask for a huge favor. It turns out that his future in laws are flying in the morning of the wedding, and he has to go pick them up, therefore he can’t pick up my daughter the day of and wanted to ask if I could take her. I said absolutely not and asked why he can’t pick her up the day before when she gets off of school. He said he doesn’t want to make the drive twice, and that he will likely not have time as he has to prepare for the rehearsal dinner. I asked why can’t the bride pick up her parents, he said she’ll be getting her hair done and won’t be able to. I laughed and told him there was no way I’d take my daughter, and that he’d have to figure it out.

Boy why did I say that. My daughter ran downstairs crying, face beet red 10 minutes after my conversation with her dad, calling me terrible and accusing me of not wanting her to spend time with her dad. I told her that’s not the case and she demanded to know why I couldn’t take her, I couldn’t give her an answer and she ran upstairs crying. Now I’m getting messages from his family calling me “heartless” and “cold” and a “bitch” for trying to “ruin his special day over a relationship that is long over”. My family understands my point of view. But I feel terrible that I’ve upset my daughter. I don’t know what to do. AITA? Should I just put aside my feelings and take her?",22166,xel99t,"He couldn't find *any* trustable adult to pick his daughter up? There must be someone? An uncle? Grandma? No one?

Edit: honestly, I think OP should have a heart to heart conversation with her daughter and explain the reason why she's not comfortable driving her to the wedding. It's not fair to have the dad creating all this caos in OP's life and also not wanting the cheating story to be revealed. Soon or later, the daughter will find out. Cheaters are eventually outed.

AITA for saying it’s a little embarrassing that a girl’s nanny puts little notes in her lunch,"So, this girl, Nicole(16), started going to my (16f) school after winter break. She’s a little weird tbh. She doesn’t talk a lot and when she does talk, she’s so quiet that you can barely hear her. 

She used to eat in her car but one of my friends felt bad for her and invited her to eat with us. I noticed that all of her lunches had a little piece of paper and she’d read it, smile for like 2 seconds, then fold it up and put it in a pocket in her lunchbox. Sometimes she’d take it out and read it a couple times during lunch.

I eventually asked what it is and she said she has a nanny and she writes her notes every day. I asked if she thinks that’s a little embarrassing because I don’t know anyone who’s had notes in their lunches past 5th grade. 

She got kinda defensive and said that her nanny does similar things for her siblings, who are all in preschool or elementary school so it kinda proved my point. 

She started eating in her car again and one of my friends got mad at me because apparently she had a really bad home life before moving here and she’s never had anyone do that stuff for her. Idk how tf she expected me to know, considering she usually only talks about school but it’s starting some drama in my friend group so I wanted to know if I was the asshole.",22163,tb14vi,"YTA, you made someone feel bad about something that brings them joy for a brief moment.

AITA for kicking my SIL out for eating my order?,"

My husband's sister moved in with us after a major argument about the baby's name (they're expecting and she's 7 months in!). she's known be picky and refuses to eat what what we normally cook.

We only cook her favorite food, which I can't eat (allergies yay!!) Everyday at dinner I have to figure out what to eat since she only eats food that I'm allergic to.


Last night, My husband agreed that he'd cook for her and cook for us together seperately. I got home after a long day at work and found out that SIL convinced my husband to only cook the meal she wanted and cancel on the meal we planned to have. I saw them eating together in the kitchen. My husband apologitically said his sister convinced him to eat with her and not cook the meal I wanted us both to have. I said it was FINE then went to order some food from the restaurant.


I went to take a shower and did some work on my laptop then came downstairs to find my order placed on the kitchen counter. It was open and someone ate the majority of it. I turned around and there was SIL standing saying she woke up hungry and couldn't ""resist"" the smell that was coming out of the box. I lost it and yelled at her asking wtf she did that but she said that she did save me some which isn't true because there was only some rice and dressings. We started arguing and I told her I couldn't take this anymore and told her to pack her shit and leave first thing in the morning. She began crying and my husband got involved and defended her up and down repeatedly saying she's pregnant and is eating for 2 basically. He suggested I go make myself something quick from the fridge and let it go but I refused and a bigger argument ensued.


AITA for kicking her out over this?",22117,xxfkmg,"NTA

Eating for two is not a license to be a selfish asshole.  She ATE, then knowing you'd ordered food because you couldn't eat the food she INSISTED on having, she ate yours, TOO.

The fuck?!

I would have shouted the house down.  She has a husband to torture, he signed up for that shit not you.  I'll bet she is used to the world revolving around her.

She's a shit for being selfish, and sorry but your husband is a shit for not putting his foot down and defending your boundaries.  She doesn't care, because her brother hasn't yanked her up short and explained how it's not ok to be a selfish asshole to his wife, her host.

I messaged his mom and asked if this was okay and how late he was staying. She asked if he could stay until 10. I serve dinner around 8, so he would be eating with us. I cook a lot of Indian cuisine in my house because that's what I grew up making. My son told me his friend was picky and asked if I could make him something else. I keep fries and chicken nuggets for when my son has picky friends over. So we all sit to eat, and my son's friend seems happy with the nuggets, and they go to play after dinner. The boy's mom picks him up a little after 9. I get a text later asking why I fed her son frozen food when I cooked a fresh dinner for everyone else. I told her my son said the boy wouldn’t eat what I was making. She said I should have made him something also instead of just getting freezer food. I told her I provided free childcare without notice, and her kid chose not to eat what everyone else ate. I continued that when I was a child, my mom didn’t offer anyone alternatives to what was made, so he’s lucky I accommodated him. She told me she wouldn’t let her son stay with a child abuser anymore.",22102,v18xx5,"NTA That is pretty entitled behavior on his moms part.

AITA for singing a song to my wife at our wedding and making her angry?,"I just got married last week (my wife and I are both in our thirties). I am Mexican, she is American, but we both grew up in the US and both our families know both languages. My wife planned every bit of the wedding and was a very controlling and nervous bride, but alright, I get that she was stressed. 

During the reception I went to the band and asked them to play a song for me to sing to my new wife. It was Te Amare by Miguel Bose. It was the song from out first date in a really bad Mexican restaurant, so it became a long standing joke between us. 

The guests really loved the song, my MIL cried and told me it was beautiful, but my bride seemed upset.

AITA for snitching and causing my friend to lose her scholarship/dream college acceptance?,"I (19F) am a sophomore in college and have a friend, Tia (18F), who is in high school and applying for colleges and scholarships. I helped her throughout the college process and she ended up getting in early action to her top college, and she got a full scholarship. I was happy for her until recently. 

I was talking to a mutual friend of ours and she started gushing about how Tia’s essay was so heartfelt and beautiful. I asked to see it because I thought she had just forgotten to show me (she showed me many of her essay drafts). But as I was reading it, I was completely taken aback. The essay was one of MY college essay drafts which I’d shown to Tia for reference on writing TECHNIQUES ONLY. I made this clear. 

I was livid. The essay was really personal, and she barely even tweaked it up. It was almost entirely copied and pasted. I trusted her with it, and this is what she did. 

In a fit of rage, I gathered all the evidence of me helping her with the college process, including evidence of me sending the specific essay to her, and I showed it to the school. She not only lost her scholarship, but she also lost her seat in the school. 

Now, people are calling me dramatic and shaming me for robbing her of her education. She’s the only person in her family to get into college and receive an academic and athletic scholarship, so everyone was rooting for her, including me at one time. And while I didn’t expect the outcome to be so severe, it was. 

Right now, I feel bad. I feel terrible. I feel like she took advantage of me, but I didn’t want to be the cause of something so horrible. I did myself a justice, but at the cost of someone’s dreams. Now I’m wondering if what I did was justified or not. 

AITA?

AITA for telling my sister that she should have gone to college if she wanted a life like mine?,"Hello everyone, please excuse my grammar. English is my 4th language and 100% self taught. Also this will be a long post. 

My sister and I are twins (33F). We come from a culture where arranged marriages are an option (not India). Mostly they are blind dates set by a matchmaker. And if you are compatible you marry. 

When we both graduated highschool, my sister (who was valedictorian BTW) chose not to attend college. She asked for an arranged marriage since all she wanted to be was a wife and mother (nothing wrong with that). My parents (who are a love match) tried to convince her to at least get her bachelor's. She refused. I on the other hand started attending an engineering college (computer engineering) 

A year later she married a man that she met through the matchmaker. He is a very nice man, a teacher and treats my sister like a queen. The thing is he was just a freshly hired teacher. My sister went from living in a double income house with parents being both high earners (a doctor and a lawyer) to a single income house on a teacher's salary. 

I graduated at 23, started working as a cyber security personnel for a big bank. After 2 years of dating around, I too asked for an arranged marriage. 

My husband is a business owner (real estate developer) and he makes a lot more than I do. He also comes from money. 

My sister didn't like him from the get go, she even threw a tantrum (thankfully in private) in my wedding. Apparently the bride gifts he brought were tacky (more like very expensive, more than what yer husband could get her) 

The problem is that my first child is now at the age where she will be starting pre-school, we signed her for a private school. The monthly tuition is more than what her husband makes. 

When she heard this she just exploded. She was ranting about how it's not fair that our kids will not have equal opportunities, how the only reason I could live like I do was that my parents chose a better husband for me. 

I became angry, for how she treats me, how unfair she was to her husband and my parents, so I laid the truth on her, I told her I got matched with a better husband because I am a college educated woman with a respectable job, and that wealthy men using matchmakers don't want 19 years old highschool graduates, their standards are higher. I told her that her husband is a wonderful man who loves her, but if all she wanted was wealthy man she should have gone to college. 

Now she is NC with me, she says that I am an elitist AH. 

So AITA?",22018,v2so1r,"NTA. 

She's jealous/envious of your life because you decided to go through college and became successful. Also, how horrible she is to be talking about someone she presumably loves. Sounds like she was only marrying for money, not for love.

You told her point blank what it is. If she wanted a wealthy husband, she should've went to college. Her decisions/choices are the reason why her life is the way it is. Also, it's her fault that her children won't have the same opportunities as yours.",21022,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v2so1r/aita_for_telling_my_sister_that_she_should_have/
AITA for telling my sister I will no longer give her my breast milk?,"I (28F) had a stillbirth 5 weeks ago. My sister gave birth to a healthy baby boy 4 weeks ago. After my stillbirth, I was producing milk and pumping, and my sister couldn't breastfeed after her son was born. Formula shortage was awful and I was literally throwing my milk away, so I offered it to my sister and she gladly accepted. 

I was advised by the doctors to pump for 3 weeks after the stillbirth to prevent problems for me, and then stop, otherwise I'd just keep producing milk. Due to the formula shortage, I have been pumping for 5 weeks now, to give the milk to my sister. Now that there is more formula in stock and she has been able go buy it, I told her I'll stop pumping. 

She told me her son has stomach problems after the formula and asked me to keep pumping. I told her I emotionally cannot handle it any longer. She said I am being selfish and she already has to feed her son by bottle (because she at first suggested I'd just nurse him for his daily feedings at least - we live next door, and I refused). 

I told her I'm sorry and I can pump for a few more days so she can put some in the freezer and have some back up until she finds a better formula for her son, but she said breast milk is healthiest and I should just help her out. 

She called me a selfish AH and said that I am the embodient of 'misery loves company'. My mother feels I should help my own sister out. My husband said my sister is way out of line. I feel really awful because I could still help her out and I know she needs it.

Edit: i just want to thank all of you for all this support ❤ thank you so very much, I couldn't respond to every single message, but I am so so grateful for it.",22018,vhpwm1,"NTA - Your husband is right.

AITA for ordering takeout after my husband tricked me to cook for his kids?,"
AITA? Hello. So to give some context, I f35 have been married to my husband, m37 for 6 months. He has 2 children from two different (uninvolved) mothers and they live with us full time. The kids are 7y.o. And 10y.o.


I work long hours and it's a demanding job time wise. My husband thinks that just because I wfh that I can pause whenever but it's untrue. He'd ask me to do things for the kids or him during work hours, but I told him I'm working and unavailable during those hours, and that the kids are his responsibilty til I'm done.


Yesterday, He told me he wanted to go attend a friend's engagement dinner and asked if I could ""take time off work"" to make the kids dinner. I told him absolutely not, and insisted that he cook for them or order takeout. He said he had no time to cook, and takeout was off the table since he doesn't want them to eat fast food. He later said fine and that he was going to cook dinner then go to the party.


2hrs later, the kids came in and said they were hungry. I was puzzled, I asked if their dad cooked them dinner and they said he didn't. Moreover!!! He told them to come ask me to cook for them at exactly 7pm. I was so pissed to find myself in this situation. I took few minutes off the meeting and ordered takeout from the nearby restaurant and fed the kids, then had them watch tv then go to sleep.


He came home at 11PM and went off on me after he discovered that I didn't cook like he was counting on me to do. Not only that, but he yelled about feeding the kids takeout. I argued back saying I had no choice after he basically tricked me into cooking for them knowing I was busy, so I ordered food and made sure the kids were fed while I focused on work. He ranted about how I care more about work than my stepchildren (God forbid) and called me selfish then went upstairs and refused to talk to me. He's still sulking about it today and says I need to get my priorities ""in order"" cause they're messed up.


Info - About that friend's engagement. My husband has this friend from college. They're close and he couldn't miss the event. Moreover, he said he was upset with me for missing the event and now refusing to cook a homemade healthy meal and ordering takeout knowing it's a ""no go"" for him.

Info - The reason I expected him to cook other than the fact that I was busy, was that he usually cooks for them so it's both of our responsibility.

Info - Does he work? Yes, but barely. He works at a warehouse only twice a week. His friend's dad owns the warehouse and do he has a lot of leverage.

Info - More context on the mothers. One is an ex wife, the other is an ex girlfriend. Both left for financial reasons he said but I'm not fully convinced by that.",21998,y80jvd,"INFO: Aside from stepkids and audacity, what does he bring to the table?",5243,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/y80jvd/aita_for_ordering_takeout_after_my_husband/
AITA for telling my dad (who left) that I don't remember him?,"I'm 15F and my father is 46M.

My dad left the family when I was 7 without any explanation. He just vanished one day, and I've never seen him since. He left because of relationship issues with my mom. She was heartbroken, and waited 5 years for him to return - but in the end filed for divorce. Thankfully, she's over him now.

To be honest, now - 8 years after he left, I barely have any memory of him. Only some resentment for the years of suffering he put my mom and sister (19F) through. They tried and tried to contact him, but he'd never respond. I can't remember his voice, personality, or even face much. 

Last week, he texted my mother and said he wanted to meet, after 8 years of disappearance. My mom agreed. We arranged a meet-up at a nearby restaurant. My sister was so nervous/excited, but I realised I felt nearly nothing. 

He arrived, and my mom and sister started crying. He cried too, at the sight of his 'beloved daughters'. He saw that I looked quite emotionless, and said ""Don't you miss your dad?"" I replied honestly that I didn't remember him. He left so long, it's like I barely knew him. 

He was so shocked and hurt. Eventually, he cut off our 'meet-up' early, claiming he had to work. My mom and sister were so mad, they blamed it on me. My mom said that my sister's been waiting to see her dad for so long, but I had to make a stupid remark and make him leave a second time. Asking how I could behave like this towards my *dad*. Telling me that I'm a selfish bitch and asshole.

I'm sorry that he cut the meet-up short, 'cause I knew my sister missed him so damn much. But to be honest, I don't feel bad for saying the truth.

AITA for telling my fiancée she’s not the breadwinner if she’s not footing the bills in front of our families and friends?,"My fiancée and I moved in together shortly before we got engaged. Before we did, we discussed how we'd split the housework and bills. 50/50 down the middle with some wiggle room for when the other needs help. When we moved, it was into her parents' 2-story garage that they converted into basically an apartment. They offered a low rent (700 total), and pitch in for the electric and internet so we could save money for our own place and wedding.

My fiancée earns more than me and that's cool, I'm proud of her. Before we moved in together it always seemed like she was living paycheck to paycheck and I chalked it up to the apartment she had prior having insane high rent.

She stuck to the 50/50 arrangement at first concerning bills but she missed often and I had to remind her about it. Post-engagement, she's back to living paycheck to paycheck, either missing or very late with her part of the rent monthly, the two utilities we pay, groceries, late with her car payment. Her parents have talked to me multiple times about rent and I've covered her missing portion to get us caught up, and then try talking to her. It always turns into her saying we should just move if her parents are going to hound us. I told her we're lucky its her parents because anywhere else would've kicked our asses out. On top of that, I pay my own bills, do about 65% housework, arrange and pay for most of our dates and vacations, gifts for her, pay most towards our pets.

I've suggested a financial coach but what kicks me is whenever we're around others, she boasts about being the breadwinner since she earns more. Goes on about the stresses of being the main source of income, all the hours she has to work to ""pay all our bills"". I was letting it slide until few days ago we were at a get together. She and her sister started up again about her being the breadwinner. Her sister said something to the effect of her ex-boyfriend had a hard time being with someone who earned more, and my fiancée went ""Good thing OP doesn't mind me bringing home the pay"".

I told her just because she earns more doesn't make her the breadwinner when she blows it all on herself and I'm paying most the bills. She's embarrassed now and keeps saying I made her look bad and got her in trouble with her parents because they want to see what she spends her money on each month, but I don't think I did anything wrong. AITA?

Update: 11 last night I was ready to just postpone the engagement, as of this morning after a lot of talking and things coming to light, we are broken up. Thank you everyone for your responses and input, especially those who encouraged looking deeper. Quick summary:

\- She felt a joint account would impede her financial independence.

\- She insisted 'we' could afford her purchases based off our total incomes.

\- Her parents were under the impression she was also paying off my student loans, my car, my phone, and paying for our vacations.

\- She didn't get evicted from her last apartment but she was late with her rent often enough that they weren't going to renew her lease, so she didn't suggest us moving to a bigger apartment at her building.

\- Biggest 'Nope I'm out' the monthly take home amount she told me was what she earned BEFORE wage garnishment kicked in, in addition to mass debt. She's been doing some online stuff to make up for the money she loses due to that.

Yes, I got the ring back. Again, thank you everyone but I will not be responding to anymore comments. I'm going to go take some time for myself and get shit figured out.",21948,v78ax5,"NTA.

AITA for taking my wife’s side after she screamed and cursed at my mother?,"On mobile, throwaway. This just happened and my wife is currently sleeping while my mom is blowing up my phone. 

*Added some edits at the bottom!*

I (33m) am married to my wonderful wife Melody (29f) and she is currently pregnant with our first child together. I have a 6 year old daughter Tina who’s mother I split 50/50 custody with, so I know for the most part what Melody needs in order to feel supported while she carries our child. I have been spending lots of time making sure she’s comfortable and taking on more of the load at home so she’s not doing too much, this is her first child after all and it’s obviously a lot for her physically and emotionally. 

My mother and Melody don’t get along too well, mom didn’t like my ex either (we broke up because we were headed on different paths not because of my mother and there’s no bad blood) so I think she just doesn’t like her because she’s dating me for whatever reason it’s weird. She’s very nit picky about Melody, how much she does around the house, how emotional she is (Melody already cries very easily and being pregnant has made her even more sensitive which is fine), the fact that she wants to be a stay at home mom, it just seems like nothing Melody does is okay. I do however stand up for her and do not just allow my mom to talk down to her.

Today before picking up my daughter from summer camp Melody went to 3 different grocery stores to find rotisserie chicken, she’s been talking about it since last night and really really wanted one lol. She sent me picture messages documenting her quest for the chicken and finally found it. My girl was HAPPY. Rotisserie chicken is also kind of a comfort food for her like spaghetti because her mom used to make one of those when she was “having a lazy day” and didn’t feel like cooking. She was planning on serving that with some other basic sides for dinner, perfectly fine by me. My mother came by to see Tina and started telling Melody the chicken is bad for her and she should not be eating that pregnant. Melody said it’s fine, she usually eats healthy and just wants this one thing she’s craving. My mom went on about how unhealthy it was and said she needs to eat something else. Melody said no and went to the backyard to FaceTime her family (out of state). When she came back my mom had thrown out the food and ordered take out, a salad for Melody and pizza for everyone else. Melody asked where the chicken was and my mother told her she needs to start being a responsible mother and eat correctly for the baby. Melody screamed “WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU? WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS SUCH A BITCH TO ME?” She then started crying and called me home. I came back and asked my mother to leave after hearing her story and said she is not to come back until she apologizes for how she treated Melody. My mom went on about how I’m choosing another woman over her but I just think enough is enough and Melody reached her limit. She apologized to me for blowing up when Tina was in the house but I told her it’s okay tings happen, Tina is okay and I went to find her another chicken before the store closed. My dad thinks I’m right for taking Melodys side but my brother thinks I should always defend mom so AITA?

EDIT: Okay not to be that guy but I did NOT expect this to get so much attention? I woke up to so many notifications and I’m going to try to go through as many as I can but wow thank you guys for all the support and awards! Melody loves all the kind messages from all of you especially the “mamas & soon to be mamas who get it” as she put it lol

1. My mom claimed it was the seasonings & fat/grease that made the chicken bad for her. It’s all BS but that’s what she claimed. 

2. I do plan on having a sit down with both my parents and my brother with my mom. A LOT of you have mentioned emotional incest (which is creeping me out) and other things along those lines that need to be addressed. I’ll talk to my dad first then have a family meeting. A lot of you asked why I would still want my mom around and honestly maybe I’m just weak but that’s my mother, however if she cannot learn to change and respect my family then we will just have to go NC. It’s hard but it is what it is. Melody doesn’t even want to completely cut her out she just wants change as well. But I will protect Melody at all costs and if that means cutting off my mom then so be it.

3. My ex and I did not break up because of my mother. We had different ideas of where our lives were going. Tina was not planned and we were already heading towards going our separate ways before she got pregnant. We tried to make it work for Tina but that’s not what relationships are about, so we split and it’s working great. My ex and Melody get along great, Tina is happy and we work through things as one big blended family. My ex and Melody have talked about my mother with each other before and that was when I realized I needed to see a therapist to work through my childhood with a mom like mine. It’s a process. I’m working through it the best I can.

4. Some people asked about our culture, we are all Black Americans. So I think it’s more of a mom son thing than a cultural thing.

5. Not sure how to update (someone please comment and let me know!) but I’ll update after I speak to my dad & have the family meeting. Lots of you recommended JustNoMIL & RaisedByNarcissists (i think those are the page names) and I will definitely check them out

6. Melody’s pregnancy is going smoothly for the most part! Just “exhausting and emotional” as she put it. Also we’re having a girl! We had our gender reveal last week for those who were wondering and thank you for all the well wishes! #GirlDad 🙌🏾

"AITA for calling my brother a “sore, slow loser?”","Throwaway account.

My wife, “Irene,” is very fit.  She likes working out and has a proper exercise regime etc. She believes that if she “feels good” she “looks good,” and she feels good working out, so who am I to stop her? 

My brother, “Will,” spent the latter half of last year going through a messy divorce and now needs a place to stay. Though my brother and I aren’t very close, I figured he would only stay with us for a couple weeks until he got back on his feet. 

Will is a typical “gym rat.” He’s always on a very strict diet, always working out and bragging about his “gains.” I’ve worked out with him a few times and he’s a little obnoxious. He’s always mad at you if you don’t work at his pace and is always trying to correct your form. He’s a pretty fit and muscular guy, but I don’t like to exercise with him. 

Will has been pushing Irene to  workout with him because, according to him, “she won’t be able to keep up with him.” Irene mostly just shrugs him off with a laugh and tells him she would love to workout with him. Irene works out in the mornings (3 times a week) and then does a run in the evening, but she’s been busy this past week and hasn’t been able to stick to her usual schedule. Will thinks that she’s making excuses because she doesn’t want to be “embarrassed” by him. Again, Irene just laughs him off. 

About two days ago, Irene and Will went on an early morning run. I didn’t go with them, but the first thing I heard when Will entered the house was, “The only reason I couldn’t keep up with you (Irene) is because you were sweating too much.” I found this extremely comical, and kinda just laughed him off. Irene rolled her eyes and went to take a shower, so I thought that the conversation would die.

However, Will just kept bringing up my wife’s sweat.

My wife went to work and he told her, “to make sure she doesn’t sweat through her clothes,” or when she called me in the middle of day, he yelled, “tell the sweaty bitch I said hi.” Of course, the bitch comment aggravated me and I told him to knock it off and stop acting like a child.

I thought that was the end of it, but he just kept going.  By the end of the day, I was tired of his comments, but Irene seemed rather unphased by them. When she served him food, he made a comment about her “sweating into the food.” At this point, I was at my wits end and I told him to stop acting like a “sore, slow (referring to his running pace) loser and eat his food.” Will, of course got angry, and said the only reason he was going slower than usual was because he was “distracted by my wife’s unhygienic sweat.”  Irene looked a bit offended by this, and I told Will that I would kick him out if he made another comment like that.

He’s been super pissed ever since. I jokingly told this story to a mutual friend and they agreed with Will. Maybe I shouldn't be so harsh.

UPDATE: I didn't expect this amount of responses. Thank you for all the advice! 

I've decided to kick him out. He will be staying at a nearby hotel now.",21897,t6o6uy,"wow, hard to imagine why your brother got divorced. NTA",4407,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t6o6uy/aita_for_calling_my_brother_a_sore_slow_loser/
AITA for giving my husband one day to return the bracelet that he took from his daughter's mom?,"
It's a bit complicated, so bear with me. 

I f34 have been with my husband m37 for 2 years, he has a 9 year old daughter with his ex wife (Nora) and the reason for the divorce was financial. but she told me he initiated after she got diagnosed with cancer. Now cancer has come back and I feel sorry for her because she's a decent woman overall. 

Due to treatment schedule Nora only gets visitation with my stepdaughter for now, my husband drives my stepdaughter to see her mom 2 days a week. 

Yesterday he came home saying Nora wasn't home and he and my stepdaughter had to leave after waiting for an hour. He then went into the bedroom, stayed there for sometime then went out to visit his friend. 

I was cleaning the bedroom and found a gold bracelet that looked familiar, I realized it belonged to Nora as I'd seen her wear it before. I was confused I waited til he got home to ask him about it. His reaction wasn't good, he lashed out and took it out of my hand saying I shouldn't touch his personal stuff. I said this wasn't his stuff this is Nora's, I asked if he took  this bracelet behind her back and he said no, Nora gave it to him so he could give it to their daughter once she's 20 in case something happens to Nora. I don't know why but I didn't believe him, I told him I would call Nora to ask her but he started yelling at me to stay out of his family business. We started arguing and I kept demanding he tell me how and why he got this bracelet. he refused to say anything first, then he admitted going into Nora's room and taking it while she was out. I told him thus wasn't okay but he said this was his right after he spent money on her treatment before but never got his money back. I was shocked by this statement, they were married back then and he shouldn't expect to be repaid. I got mad and told him he has 1 day to return the bracelet or I'll tell Nora and let her involve the authorities if she had to cause the bracelet looked heavy and pricey. He begged me to stay out of it but I refused. He said I was being malicious and should side with him not threaten him but I refused to negotiate anything, and I'm responsible for my word now. Nora is a decent woman who's struggling and I feel like she should know she can't trust her own daughter's father in her home after this.

AITA for dumping the truth on my sister?,"My parents had two girls me (17f) and my sister (14f). I have always felt like my parents saw me as a babysitter, as a third adult in the house, and have expected me to be a 40 year old kid/teenager. Whereas my sister was their baby. They spoil her rotten. They adore her. She has never wanted for anything and they do everything to make her happy.

I was expected to help take care of my sister for as long as I can remember. She's not special needs, was never sick, wasn't even a preemie either. But that was the dynamic that was set up. I remember I would come home from school and mom would have me help feed my sister. She would have me watch her then while she was in and out of the house. I would be told I needed to play with her if my sister was upset. She'd miss me a lot and my parents would insist I dedicate my time to her once I was home. We'd go out as a family and she'd want something and they'd get it for her. But I would be told to act my age if I wanted something. She would get to hang out with friends whenever she wanted, would have really amazing birthday parties and sleepovers that I was never allowed to have. I also never got to attend sleepovers at other friends houses. There were times my parents would take her to do really amazing stuff and I was left behind.

Over time my sister started to get annoyed by my pulling back when I was around 15. I kept to myself, I'm moody around them, I don't engage in the ""family"", I take the punishments rather than do chores since she has none assigned to her. My parents hate that I won't be the little house keeper they wanted. My sister has told me I'm a brat and ungrateful for not helping our parents who are amazing. Over time it has gotten worse.

Then she heard me making plans to leave with my friends in a couple of months. She was so pissed that I was going to leave the family behind and that I hadn't told the family anything. She talked about how mom and dad have saved for us to go to college and I just wanna run away. Something broke inside me when she said that. I told her SHE has a college fund waiting for her, but I don't. Just like SHE can get anything she wants while I'm told to act my age and not want anything. I told her she expects me to be a maid when I get nothing and she gets everything. I told her I am not that much older than her but everyone expects me to be an adult. I asked her how she'd feel if she was supposed to juggle a younger sibling, taking care of the bulk of household chores, schoolwork and not getting time with friends. That the only reason you have shit is because you work, but it leaves you exhausted because you already have so much on. I told her that is my life and she doesn't make me want to stay any more than our parents do.

To cut this short she's upset and I was called an asshole for being so mean to her. My sister said I was an asshole for dumping all that on her shoulders.

AITA?",21866,xxx7ah,"> I was called an asshole for being so mean to her

There is a difference between being mean and being honest at a breaking point. You didn't call her names. You didn't say things to insult her. All you did was tell her how you've felt all these years.

If her response to being told that *you* have had nothing your whole life while she had everything is to call you ""mean"" she is too far gone. Maybe later in life she'll see what was happening and may try to make amends and you can have a sister. But right now you have two bosses and a client.

AITA for showing my husband proof that his mom offered to bring him steak dish to the hospital?,"My husband was in a car accident last week. He was staying at the hospital for his broken leg. Only me and his mom were there. His mom and I don't get along AT ALL. he tells me I'm overreacting or paranoid whenever I point out how she's mistreating me.

He complained about hospital food saying it had no taste and asked me to make his favorite meal which's steack dish and bring it to him at the hospital. Noting that steak isn't cheap where we live and I didn't have enough time to prepare it. I told him I will see what I can do then his mom said if I'm truly a supportive wife then I'd make it happen.

Once we went outside his room, His mom's tone changed. She suddenly seemed nice and said that she could see how exhausted I was and so I should go home and not worry about the steak dish because she said she'd make it for him. I asked if she was 100% sure and she said ""absoluetly!!"".

The next visit I showed up and my husband asked why I didn't bring the steak dish he asked for. I saw his mom there I told him his mom offered to make it for him instesd and told me not to worry about it. He didn't believe and was like ""mom said that? I'm not buying it, mom you really said that?"" her reaction shocked me. She acted confused and said that I'm his wife and she didn't know why I'd expect her to ""perform"" my duties for me. I was confused and didn't know what to do. My husband seemed upset the entire visit and I waited til his mom left to talk.

I swore to him his mom said she'd take care of it but he said he didn't believe me. I pulled my phone out, called his mom and put her on speaker so he could hear the conversation. I said ""didn't you say you'd make the steak dish and that I didn't have to worry about it?"" she relied ""I did...but I obviously wasn't actually going to do it, I was just trying to help my son see how his wife is during the rough times and you took the bait"". My husband raised his eyebrows. He got pissed he called her later and picked a fight then said no more visiting.

AITA for flipping out on my husband for cancelling my job interview?,"new account because he deleted my main.


So, this might sound petty but let me explain.

In 2019 I could no longer work because of my physical disabilities. no company wanted to hire me for the past couple of years and My husband said that it's better I just stay home and not worry about working. I agreed and he's become the breadwinner, then... it's like a switch that flipped because chores were 50/50 but after I lost my job they become 100% on me (keep in mind my physical disabilities I developed). his excuse for not doing anything to help is that I stay at home 24.7, I told him that's not fair especially since I suffered from physical discomfort. he made a deal with me and promised that everything will be 50/50 once I start working again. I told him I would find a job and he laughed and said ""good luck"" (I remember this vividly because of the strange laugh that I never heard him laugh before)


I started looking for a job again for months but had no luck til my friend's husband found me a potential job at a company that would have me wfh due to physical strains. I was so excited and felt like I'm capable again despite the struggle, they scheduled an interview with me and when I told my husband he looked red in the face but said nothing.

2 days ago I found out that my job interview got cancelled, I found out when my friend reached out to ask why I did that but I said I had no Idea. I checked my email and found nothing because I didn't send anything to the company. My husband came home and admitted cancelling the interview. I asked why and he said that ""this job had lots of requirments and I didn't seem fit to be accepted there so to spare me the heartache of being rejected, he just cancelled the interview"". I flipped out on him and told him he destroyed my one and only chance at landing a job. but he said he was just feeling concerned about my wellbeing, I told him he probably didn't want me to work cause he didn't want to split house chores and he seemed offended by that. He threw a fit about how unreasonable and selfish I was to even consider a job without speaking to him first. I told him I don't get involved in his work life. He called me horrible for accusing him of bad intention then went out to meet his friends probably to vent because one of them told me that my husband is looking out for me but I was being cruel to him by yelling.


he has been cold shouldering me since then, deleted my social media accounts claiming that they're bad for my mental health because of the negative affect some of those platforms have.

Most place like FB still archive them for a certain amount of days and there are multiple ways to recover them. I work in IT and can try to help you get them back & protected so he can't do it again. No charge. 

I have been victim of isolating Narcissistic abuse & almost guarantee there is a chance that they're not permanently deleted and he has just changed them/unplublished them so you can't access them so he can use them against you in the future. That way he could send messages as ""you"" or make posts that make you look mentally unstable in efforts to control the narrative. 

Please let me help you try to get those accounts back before it's too late or help you build new ones that he can't access. I'll even set an email up under my .com domain  so even if he gets access, we could still get you back in, if needed.

AITA for telling my husband I won't cook for him again if he chose to eat his coworker's meal over mine.,"


Hear me out.

My husband (Jesse, 31) has been bringing home meals that his female coworker (Nelly) cook for him. Now I'm not the best cook and Jesse's made it clear but he still eats what I cook everyday.

What I noticed with Nelly was that she tends to take every opportunity to point out how weak and taseless my cooking is. Jesse would say nothing except steer the conversation towards something else they both relate too while I'm sitting there wallowing in my misery thinking about what she said..(also she once asked what was another chore I was good at and Jesse said ironing his suits, she in response joked about having him send her a suit of his so he could see how good she is at ironing *too*. I rolled my eyes hard but at least Jesse agreed that was weird)




Last week.....Jesse came home with a new meal she cooked. I told him I already cooked dinner and asked what he was going to do with the meal. He told me he was going to eat it for dinner. Ngl I was getting a bit irritated and he must've had noticed because he said he promised Nelly he'd eat her for dinner, and that she asked him to take a pic of the ""empty plate"" later to confirm that he'd actually eaten it. I was baffled....like completely baffled at this. I told him one thing and one thing only, told him that if he chose to eat Nelly's meal over the dinner I cooked then THIS would be the LAST time I cook for him. He started moaning about how I was being unfair and putting him in a rough place. He stalled and didn't give a clear answer til I saw him walk past me later when I set the table and prepared dinner. And put her meal in the microwave. I felt so awful, I almost cried. I then told him that from now on out I won't cook for him anymore since he made his choice. I obviously pissed him off because he went off on me calling me childish and pathetic to make this about my ""ego"". I got up from my chair and told him I owed him NOTHING and that he made his decision and so did I.


He snapped and said that this was ridiculos and that Nelly......was just doing a nice thing for him whileas my behavior was disgraceful and *disgusting*.

He then went into the bedroom and I rushed after him but he shouted *""LEAVE ME THE FUCK ALONE""*  then proceeded to shut the door and hasn't been speaking to me after that.


His mom knew about the argument and called begging me to be more patient and not make any decisions I might regret later. She agreed that Nelly was overstepping  and firmly believes she's the problem and so I shouldn't be hard on her son. But Mil is incredibly biased, meaning in her eyes, her son is a saint who can do no wrong. So that's that.

I feel like I overreacted and really messed it up when I pushed him like that.",21738,upg3aq,"Your problems are greater than a meal. Nelly sounds like she has designs on your husband.

AITA for asking my aunt what part of the penis was required to operate a toy?,"So I (26F) am expecting my first daughter with my husband (29M) in September. I grew up in a moderately religious household with pretty strictly defined gender roles. As in, since I was a girl, I had chores around the house while my younger brother did not have to do anything. 

I don't talk to my parents for a variety of reasons (going on year 5 now) so they do not know I am pregnant. Both my aunts and grandparents were very supportive of me leaving my household and as such have been my main family. Being 6 months pregnant now, people have started to give gifts and I am very grateful for them. 

We have decided that we don't want our daughter to be surrounded by pink everything with only girl things. So we have made a conscious effort to include traditionally 'boy' outfits and toys like dinosaurs and cars. We have told people that any gender items would be accepted and if it's getting too much 'pink' we have gone out to balance a bit (getting a green jacket or something). My younger aunt  has taken great offense to this because 'boys are boys and girls are girls'. And she is a very verbal and loud person and has let us know several times her opinions. She has two boys. 

 At my baby shower my older aunt gifted us a book called 'goodnight construction site' and a little stuffed truck. My younger aunt went on a tirade about how we are somehow making our daughter trans and not allowing her to be a girl. And she's a loud person so of course her saying this was more like a yell, and in front of my VERY liberal in-laws who are very supportive of our choice. 

Pregnancy hormones took over and I grabbed the toy, gave it to my younger aunt and asked her what part of the penis was needed to operate this toy truck. She yelled that's not what she meant and left. The rest of the baby shower went fine but it was a bit awkward after. Since then she has been blowing up Facebook where a bunch of people agree with her that I am making my daughter trans and have been telling me that I was an asshole. The rest of my think what we are doing is fine, but that I shouldn't have handled it that way. 

So was I an asshole?

Edited to add: wow this really blew up, I was not anticipating this much response. To answer some questions: I do not care if she ends up loving pink and unicorns etc, we will get her them then. I just was trying to balance out the sheer amount of pink items we were getting from friends and family. Almost every single gift has been heavily pink or girl influenced. To the point where she would not be dressed in anything but pink if we did not go out and buy some more boy things. I also am generally not a person who argues. But I feel like a bit of an Ahole because I intentionally said this as deadpan serious as I could and with the intent to embarrass her in front of our family members present.  My delivery and question did have the intended effect and she went quite red before leaving. 

This was also the first transphobic comment I've ever heard out of her mouth. While we all grew up quite conservative, my older aunt coming out 27 years ago really changed my family's perspective. My grandparents have changed from what they previously viewed and my aunt was always supportive of my other aunt. My younger aunt always wanted a girl, so I thought she was just trying to act out her fantasy girl with all her gifts and preferences.",21705,v1192n,"That’s ridiculous.

AITA for telling my sister I hope she never has kids?,"I'm 22f. I have 3yo twin boys and I had a baby girl not even two days ago. My sister, Jodie, is 34 and has been suffering with infertility for the past 10 years, as well as repeated miscarriages. I used to feel really bad for her and also a bit guilty as I got pregnant twice while being on contraception. It caused some tension between us when I was pregnant with my twins because she was jealous, and I was already feeling intense guilt. This time around, she wasn't as jealous but I still felt it was unfair. 

As my husband and I have decided we are done having kids, I offered to be a surrogate for my sister as soon as I'm cleared after this baby and she seemed like she was absolutely over the moon with that. In turn, she offered to watch the twins while I was in labour with my new baby, which was a relief on my part. 

I went into labour on Thursday morning, and Jodie came over to watch the kids while my husband and I went to the hospital. She seemed like she was in a great mood, and promptly rushed us out the door. 

Everything seemed fine, until we got home this morning to find thousands worth of destruction to pretty much every baby item we've purchased. Even the crib mattress was torn open. Everything was ruined. Jodie tried to pin it on the twins but they're 3, and this level of destruction had to have been done by an adult. My twins can't even reach some of the stuff that was destroyed, and they certainly do not know how to open diaper packages and tear them apart. I know kids, especially toddlers, can do a lot of damage in a short time but I also know my children aren't capable of doing what happened. 

I told my sister to get the fuck out of my home and stay away from me and my family. I got really angry, and I said a lot of stuff I shouldn't have, but one of them was, ""I hope you never have a child, and if you do then I'll tell it exactly what you've done to mine.""  I told her we can't afford to fix the damage she's caused but since she still denies it, she wont cough up. I told her because of her the baby doesn't even have a safe space to sleep.

My parents caught wind of what I said, and even after I explained the situation, they still think I'm being an asshole for saying something so vile to my sister ""after all she's done for us"".

She brought her request up at dinner table and blatantly said that she wanted to be in the delivery room with me when I give birth. I was taken back by her request -- I really thought it had something to do with the nursery or diaper brand. I said I was sorry but only my mom and my husband will be there. She made a face, got quiet for a while then brought it up again. just kept pushing saying she is as much of a grandmother as my mom and that she just wanted to be there for support and get the opportunity to see her grandbaby's first moments. my husband sided with her.

I just stared at her and said ""it's alright, you can have the opportunity to be in the delivery room when it's your son who's giving birth"". everyone stopped eating and my mother in law left the table in an instance. My husband had me got up although I wasn't finish with dinner but he said we should leave.


In the car, he lost it on me asking ""what brain cell"" made me think it was a good idea to tell his mom that. I told him his mom kept pushing after I'd already given her an answer. still he said this was the most fucked up shit he heard me say. I replied that I was just frustrated and didn't mean to hurt her feelings and cause issues. he argued that if I don't want issues then I should stop making shit difficult and just say yes to his mom's request. he then ranted about how it's his son too and then said if his mom isn't allowed in there then he won't be there too. now I don't know if he really meant this or just said it in the hear of the moment but it had me fuming.


He's been ignoring me when I try to talk to him and act like I'm not in the room. I think I might have gone too far and created tension by responding inappropriately. AITA?

AITA for using my husband's money to pay for my daughter's Apple IPhone that he broke?,"

My daughter is 16. She had her old phone for 5 years and always wanted a new phone, I'm the only one working right now since my husband decided to take ""a break"" from work after he inherited some money from his dad.


I saw that she did pretty good at school despite having mental health issues that had gotten in the way of her focus before and so I decided to keep her encouraged and reward her by getting her an apple iPhone that cost a good sum of money. I did my best to save money to buy it, I literally skipped paying for breakfast at work to be able to afford it, and my husband didn't want to help so I was on my own.


I bought her the iPhone and quite honestly, I haven't seen her this happy in a while, it was refreshing for me because she really went through some hard time in the past couple of years emotionally and mentally.


My husband wasn't happy with this he said the iPhone will only distract her from school and chores but that wasn't true, in fact it encouraged her to do more. But he still said I shouldn't have spent that kind of money on an iPhone that she might be irresponsible with and break. My daughter picked up on his attitude towards the iPhone but I told her to ignore him.


Days ago, I found out that he broke the iPhone, I asked why and he said he asked her to get him something from the toolbox in the garage but she was on the iPhone and ignored him. He used this incident as evidence that the iPhone was bad influence but I yelled at him and demanded he replace it, he said he wouldn't so I took money out of his account and paid for a new iPhone and gave it to my daughter. He saw what I did and went off  on me calling me vicious and awful and accused me of stealing his father's money and demanded the money I took, every single penny back. I basically told him it won't happen, he got his mother on me saying I'm setting a terrible example for my daughter by getting her a phone paid for with money that I stole from her dad. My husband said he won't speak a word to me til I fix this but I already said I owe him nothing.


aita for this?

ETA: No, he's her biological father, not stepdad. And price for the iPhone where I live is a thousand dollars and its not cheap. Finding out that I took a thousand dollars out of his inheritance really got him so furious that he said I was the worst woman he met in his life (he had 2 ex wifes if this is in any way relevant) he took it back later then said he won't speak til the money is back.",21695,txq9di,NTA.

AITA for taking the cake I baked for my fiance's birthday and going home?,"
Me f25 and fiance m31 'Ben''s mom don't have the best relationship. I try my best to be polite around her but she's the type that'd have high standards/expectations of whoever dates her son's (she has 3). She's commented on my hair and body several times and at some point suggested ""cosmetic"" surgeries for the future. This upsets me but Ben tells me this is who she is and I need to learn to have a thick skin since often times, she doesn't really mean to be malicious.


Anyways, I'm known for baking cakes and sweets. Ben eats what I make but whenever I bring something to his family to try they find every excuse in the world not to eat it. I'm OK with that and stopped doing it.

For Ben's 31st birthday, his mom wanted to host the party. I decided to bake him his birthday cake and he was thrilled with it. I went grocery shopping, took time off work and put so much effort into making it how he likes it. I took it with me to his mom's house and to my surprise when I walked in I saw a large birthday cake sitting at the dinning table. I was puzzled, FMIL said she requested this cake from the bakery and paid xxx money for it. I asked ""what about the cake I've  made?"". She responded ""oh you can place it on the counter over there and we'll let the kids have it"". This felt like ice was dropped all over me, I looked at Ben and he nodded at me in a ""just do it"" way. I was so mad and the cake was still in my hands at the time. I turned around and made my way to the door. His mom remained standing but Ben followed me asking where I was going. I told him that he didn't need my cake and by extention me since my efforts were so easily dismissed and disrespected. He said i was overreacting and that his mom paid so much for that cake and it was only fair that he accept it. He begged me to get back inside and do him this favor by basically just go with the flow but I decided to go home. He got mad and started saying I was being unreasonable and stirring drama over nothing.


I went home and he didn't get back til 11 PM. He was so upset he said he and his family didn't appreciate the childish behavior I displayed and ruining his party and disrespecting his mom like that. Said I turned this into a huge deal and should've acted more maturelly instead of walking out with the cake.

AITA for wearing white to my wedding?,"I recently got married to the love of my life, J. We had a perfect wedding, except for one thing, my MIL's freakout when she saw my dress. When we had gone dress shopping, I invited her and I found my perfect dress. 

My husbands family has a tradition of always wearing blush dresses on their wedding day. They told me about this before, and I respectfully said I would wear whatever color dress my perfect dress was. Once I finally found it, it was white. MIL asked me to ask if they could alter it to make it blush, or to find a new dress if they couldn't. I said I would ask, but if they couldn't then that was that.

Long story short, they couldn't and I showed up to my wedding in a white dress. All through the ceremony MIL was seething. During the reception, she pulled me aside and asked why my dress was white. I told her that I didn't want to find a new dress and they couldn't alter it. She said it was a tradition, and she was disappointed that I had broke it. J also said that he was disappointed when I walked down the aisle in a white dress.

AITA for forcing my husband to pay for my daughter's piano after he damaged it?,"My husband & I have been together for 2 an a half years. I have a daughter ""Callie"", she's 13, she loves instrumental music and piano has been her #1 interest. I'm not saying this because she's my daughter but really, I see her talent as special and more importantly...she uses it to express her feelings especially for her deceased father who passed away when she was 7. She always says that she, in a way connects to him through playing piano. So I encouraged her to do more and her grandparents bought her a 6000 thousand piano that she was so thrilled with.

The whole family encourages her but my husband thinks she's being distracted from school, real future etc. He doesn't attend her plays, doesn't help with the academy, doesn't even take the time to listen to her playing and everytime he comes home and hears her playing upstairs, he'd lecture us about how this activity is just a waste of time. I sat him down and told him about Callie picking up on that bad vibe, he got mad and said that he was doing my job for me and ensuring she doesn't get distracted from school although her grades are good.

We went back an forth on this and I made it clear that this should stop. He said okay and that was the end of it.

On Sunday a huge argument ensued in the house because my husband claimed Callie woke him up on his day off with her loud playing. He issued an ultimatuim, either the piano goes or he gets rid of it himself. I asked where should I take it? He said Callie's grandparents house but Callie didn't want to. After we left I found out that my husband took it to the junk yard his dad works at and cut it into pieces. A big argument ensued and we literally had a screaming match infront of his family over this. I gave him 2 days to pay for a new one despite him apologizing and saying he acted in a moment of desperation and frustration. He said the only way he could pay for it is using his savings that was supposed to go towards his new Garage as a side business. He complained about me forcing him to pay and ruining his business before it even starts. 


He kept sending his family as middle-men to get me to give him at least 4 months but I refused and stood my ground despite being called unreasonable since it's a piano vs new business. 


AITA for forcing him to pay and not giving him time?

EDIT ~~ No, he didn't have an issue with whatever Callie was doing at first til we started living together. At first I thought that as a family we tend to get annoyed by stuff other family members do but apparently...this is not the case.

There's research showing that playing a musical instrument is good for you in a bunch of ways. 

IDK if he's jealous because it's a connection with her deceased father, but that's really not a good look.

> On Sunday a huge argument ensued in the house because my husband claimed Callie woke him up on his day off with her loud playing. He issued an ultimatuim, either the piano goes or he gets rid of it himself.

Yeah, because that's reasonable. Not ""no playing before noon on the weekends.""

There's also a third option, here: he goes.

AITA for telling my therapist lies because I suspected she was telling my husband what I was telling her during our sessions?,"I started seeing a therapist 6 months ago because I had postpartum depression. At first, she really helped me but then I noticed on two occasions my husband mentioned things I hadn’t told him but I had confided in my therapist. 

Since I had no proof and I didn’t want to accuse either of them, I decided to tell my therapist lies that I knew he would confront me on if he heard them to see if I was being delusional or not. The more I lied to her, the more suspicious I became too since even things that made my husband look awful, was challenged by her and twisted to make him look good.

It took a while for him to confront me but he did. At first, he never believed I was lying during those sessions but when I finally convinced him I was, he was still furious at me. He said he only wanted to make sure I was okay and he hadn’t been using the therapist to spy on me.

AITA for not giving up a house I inherited,"I (f 29) was raised in a Christian household. With that came gender roles that were ingrained in me at a young age. My granddad however hated that my parents taught us this way and as I got older I did too. Because of this I became very close with my grandparents instead of my own parents. I also have an older brother that my parents labeled “ the second king of the house”. For more info( important) my grandparents lived in a beautiful house that had no neighbors, many trees, and a garden. They payed off the house after years and was very special to them. My granddad also had bad problems with his back and a condition that would get worse until he couldn’t go on anymore. After my grandmother passed he got worse and ended up needing at home care. He didn’t want a stranger in his home so that wasn’t an option ( I think it was due to my grandmother passing). My parents preached that it was punishment for all his sins so they wouldn’t take care of him and were planning on putting him in a home. I decided to stay with him since it would just be easier, my job can be worked effectively at home and he’d get care from someone who isn’t a total stranger. In the time I took care of him we filled the home with the love and laughter my grandmother brought to it. As my granddad got worse not a single call. Not from my mom, or dad, or my brother. We were joking about it once and he said “ maybe I should just give you missy( the houses name lol) instead of your dad, he’s just gonna give it to your brother anyway” he laughed after he said that so I assumed he was joking. Fast forward, the worst happened. I was the one who found him. Had to make the call. All of it. As much as I was pushed away from my parents I didn’t want them to find out the news from a random person. The funeral was the first time I ever truly connected with my parents in years. We hugged and cried together and we were all vulnerable. But then it came time for the will. Now it wasn’t some telenovela with all the dramatics but it was intense. The house that was supposed to be my dad’s became mine as well as many other things that my dad planned on giving to my brother. I was accused of manipulating my granddad into giving it to me and my brother was just yelling. A week after my brother came to the house in tears. He was begging me to give him the house since his was too small for his wife and baby. He argued that because it’s just me and my husband and we don’t want kids I don’t need it. I told him to leave and felt horrible. I feel like an asshole and so does my family. He’s right I don’t need the house, my job pays me good money and I could easily just live somewhere else.

AITA for refusing to turn my son's room into a nursery for my grandson?,"

My daughter Avery (24) and her husband Tom (29) are expecting their first baby together, They're both very excited and been getting so many things done in a short time. Because they've been busy lately we haven't seen them in 2 months.


Yesterday they visited me at the house to talk about the baby mostly. Tom asked me if I had emptied one of the rooms so I could turn it into a nursery yet, I was confused by his question and asked him why. He said that he expected me to, I asked why again, he looked at me and said that every decent grandmother prepares a nursery at her home specifically to welcome her grandson as a new member of the extended family. Then went on to give examples of how common this tradition is. I don't know why but his words irked me. I asked why can't his mom prepare one for her grandson since this is her grandson too, He laughed and said that his mom already has one prepared that she paid for herself. I have to mention Tom's family is well off unlike us, we don't have an avaliable room or money to afford a whole nursery, yet, Tom insisted it's necesary and that I make efforts to make sure my grandson gets everything he needs whenever they visit. I looked at my daughter wondering if she agreed with this and by the looks of it, she did.


I told Tom that I don't have the space or money to make this happen but he argued that not making this happen will affect how many visits I get compared to his mom who's fully prepared and ""considerate"" of her grandbaby's needs. Avery finally spoke up but told me to please try to move my 16 yo son to stay with his 14 yo brother. I said no the boys are old enough to get their own room but Tom pitched in saying boys can share a room since they're boys but I wasn't convinced. In fact, I was upset they came up with this suggestion. Avery didn't like that and took it as in I don't care about her baby and don't want to do anything for him but that is just not true. The conversation turned into an argument and they left minutes later.

Avery must've called my husband because he yelled at me when he came home saying this was no way to treat my daughter and our grandchild, I told him the story and he accused me of favoring the boys over Avery like I always do but this time I just don't think her request is in any way reasonable.

Edit. One thing to clarify and that is I never said this was common, it is not unless you have a well off family that is why I think Tom said his family consider this normal.

Tom offered to pay for everything and all I have to do is empty my son's room. I said no and the argument started again with Tom saying I'm refusing to work with them on a compromise, but this is not a compromise to me.",21502,sa0zl8,NTA - is this some cultural thing?!!

AITA: for my response when my boyfriend brought up the apartment purchaee/ownership infront of his family?,"


Context: I (F29) have been with my boyfriend Adam (M27) for 2 and a half years. He's the quiet/shy type. It's very hard to get him to open up about what bothers him. For now I'm the one with an income. 

We get along easily though he can be...a bit unreasonable sometimes.e.g he doesn't cook cause he's worried I won't like his food but still cooks for himself and the smell's pretty telling that he's cooking is good. Another e,g and that is he doesn't do most chores saying he's worried he might break/damage something. It's frustrating but we're working on fixing it. 

Now unto the more complicated issue... I'd put money aside since 2015 to buy an apartment and I'm finally able to get it done this year. When I told him this he got agitated and said I should wait a little longer til we're married, but I said no. He started complaining about how bad he feels about seeing me buy the apartment myself without having him contribute. I asked what I was supposed to do because...it kinda sounded like a ""he problem"" no offense but... he got so worked up and gave me 2 options...1. is I put his name on the title, 2. is not buy the apartment til marriage so it'll become ""shared marital asset"". I said no and that was final and he should drop it. He did eventually. 

At his family's house, I was taken aback when he started complaining about the apartment and again told me to either put his name on the title or wait til marriage to buy it, cause he feels like there's a ""huge power imbalance"" here, and that he can't bring himself to accept it. He also said that it makes him feel like he contributes nothing. I snapped and said ""the reason you feel like you contribute nothing is because you literally contribute nothing and I suggest you fix that by actually finding a job and having a decent income"". His family looked shocked, he glanced at me then got up and walked away. I waited for him to come back but had to go home cause his mom said he felt too overwhelmed and wanted some space. She then basically started shaming for my ""statement"" and hinted about financial abuse and control over her son. He's not home yet demanding another tall about the apartment probably expecting me to agree to one option.

AITA for ruining my wife's work and eating the food before she could take pictures of it?,"
My wife runs a website dedicated for cooking and recipes. She takes pictures of food before we eat wether it's lunch or dinner and post them on her insta account. to be honest, I'm annoyed by having to wait so long for her to ""get the perfeft shot"" of the food after decorating it, adding this fork and removing that salad dish. It just takes so long and I lose my appetite from just waiting til she's done. This has become the norm but yesterday, I decided I was having none of it.


I came to found that she has cooked an entire feast as her ""next cooking project"" and put it on the table. Note that by lokking at the whole table setting, I figured pictures had already been taken, right? but no, she said she was gOiNg to take few pictures and I had to wait. She went upstairs to get her camera that's when I grabbed the spoon and started filling my plate from every dish she's made and ""ruining"" the look as a result. I was hungry and unwilling to wait around for 10+ to eat.


She came downstairs, saw the ""damage"" and blew up almost crying saying I just ruined her cooking project that she worked hours for as well as putting efforts into. I said I was hungry and couldn't wait but she kept yelling how much of an obnoxious jerk I was for not waiting til dhe took pictures of the dishes she made, Even said that this was an AttEmPt of me to ""Sabotage"" her success. I said ""oh please enough with those conspiracy theories, I'm just hungry and couldn't wait til she got the perfect shot"". We had a big argument and shewent upstairs crying. I finished my food then went out to cool off a bit.


When I returned she'd threatened that she'll never have me eat anything she cooks and said she'd rather throw it in the garbage then give it to a ungrateful, obnoxious jerk like me. I said this wasn't cool but she told me to go fuck myself. I said fine then went to spend the night in the guests room. she texted me the word ""jerk"" about 15 times til I turned my phone off.

Today she has gone complete radio silence. AITA?",21479,spgbvp,"YTA.

Let’s break this down:
 1) THIS IS HER JOB. She’s not making this food and making you wait to take pictures for funsies. She spent hours planning this, preparing this, and was ready to finish and you came home to ruin her work? How would you feel if she went to your workplace and destroyed a project because she was “annoyed” she had to wait a MERE ten minutes?

2) Your lack of respect for wife is appalling. This is your wife. This is her job. You’re making fun of her a getting annoyed because she wants to contribute to the family income?

3) If this is a pattern — her preparing food and requesting you wait so she can photograph it — eat a snack and be patient. Stop acting shocked that she’s going to do this. If you’re “starving” then get some fruit snacks and a juice box and wait for her to finish. Act like a toddler, snack like a toddler. Better yet, cook your own damn food!

Edit:
Even if she was doing for funsies, it doesn’t give OP any right to do what he did! I was just focusing on the job aspect of it because even though it’s something that DOES pay the bills, he still disrespects her.

She'll sit on a bench on the park and breastfeed. Go out to a restaurant? She breastfeeds. Every where. I've never spoken on it because I know she'll get mad and offended but when she did that on my wedding I lost my cool.

During the reception dinner she just did it again. I kindly approached her and asked her why she didn't bring formula or at least bump milk out and put it in the bottle so she wouldn't have to do all this at that moment. She said ""because I don't have to. I feel comfortable breastfeeding. Getting milk out on my own is more painful"" I said she could just make this sacrifice and compromise for one day instead of doing this in front of 250 guests on my wedding. She then said she can't do much about it now, because the baby has to have her milk. I told her she should be more thoughtful of that then instead of completely embarrassing herself and us by doing this.

AITA for telling my mother in law my toddler will not be going with her on a vacation she planned without asking?,"I have an almost three year old beautiful little girl. She’s just a few weeks shy of her third birthday. My baby was out in hospice four weeks ago after having gone into remission late May. Unfortunately, the cancer has returned except it is now crushing her optic nerve and is about 8cm long. Multiple doctors recommended we make our daughter as comfortable as possible as they do not believe removing the tumor is a good option. I have so much to say in regards to her diagnosis but heartbroken will suffice for now.

My husband and I have been making tons of memories with her for the past few weeks. We’ve included family in some of these memories but we both feel that we want to spend as much time with our daughter as possible. My mother in law called me yesterday to tell me she booked tickets/hotel/airfare for a trip next month. I thought it sounded fun until she said she was taking our toddler with her. Just her, my daughter, and her husband. She did not invite my husband and I.

My daughter isn’t even three yet. She has never stayed overnight anywhere and mother in law wants to take her for one entire week across the country, alone. I suggested that my husband and I both go that way our daughter is comfortable and for gods sake in the event she dies? She can’t be gone for a week. Her nurses are here. Her care is here.

I suggested what if we all go for a shorter amount of time. I came up with various suggestions to which all were turned down. I should add that if my daughter was not in hospice I still would not be comfortable with our toddler being across the country for a week alone without her parents. My child being in hospice adds another layer of complexity to the situation. 

I told my mother in law that her decisions that she made alone without consulting us was a solid no. She called me a few names and hung up on me. She then called my husband and called me a few names and suggested she would fight for rights before my daughter dies. 

I’m already grieving. My husband said we should acquiesce to his mothers trip to avoid drama (even though he agrees that our daughter is too young). But I want to spend time with her before the cancer takes her, she’s too little etc. I said no for various reasons not just to say no.

Edit: Thank you to everyone who took the time to share their thoughts and insights. I appreciate the outpouring of messages and I’m sorry I haven’t had a chance to reply to them all.

I wanted to add a few things. My mother in law lives in the same county as us. In the same city as my parents. It’s only about a 20 minute drive without traffic. However, my in laws have always been very adamant that we visit them. So I usually take my daughter over every other week for a few hours for a visit. Rarely do they ever come to our home. My parents like to visit and always have. My daughter is much closer to my parents for this reason. Anytime my husband and I go to date nights my parents come over and watch her because they like for her to be in her comfort zone. This is before the cancer. Since the cancer diagnosis we’ve been in and out of the hospital for weeks at a time. My parents have still been very much involved with helping but I’m the form of dropping off meals, helping with laundry, etc. I’m very close to my family and my family has been very respectful of us needing space as a family during this time. I think my in laws may be expediting guilt because they haven’t made much of an effort yo visit us, see us, or accommodate us. It’s always about what I, their daughter in law can do for them. Have always felt like an incubator who’s just there to facilite a relationship between them and my child. 

Also, to add, I am set on distancing myself as much as I can. I’ve cut off contact with my mil and I do not want her around after this fiasco. I’ve completely blocked her from my phone and I communicated this to my husband. He is sad but says he understands. 

A few of you mentioned that this was an eye opening situation and it really has been. On many levels.


Second edit: I saw various commands about mother in law possibly wanting to taking my child on a trip to get her alternative treatment. Mother in law planned to take my child to Disney World in Florida which is across the country from where we live. Mother in law lives in the same state, in the same county as us. My husband and I have taken our child to Disneyland a few times in her life and most recently once. Going for one day was exhausting, and my daughter was spent after the day. I can’t imagine my daughter handling Disney world for more than a day but also I would like to be there for said trip. Even if my child wasn’t dying I would still not be comfortable with her going without me. It’s such a bizmare situation. Mother in law isn’t one for alternative treatments and I haven’t out right asked her but I wouldn’t be shocked at this point. Either way, my child isn’t going anywhere with her. Supervised or not. I’ve already made that clear to my husband. She wants to come and visit it will have to be at our home. Even then I’m still not on board after everything that has transpired. I’ve been thinking really deeply the last few months but even more so in the last 24 hours.  I don’t know how I can continue being part of this family. I’m trying not to think too far ahead but I’m seriously doubting continuing on in this marriage. Thank you again everyone.

Third edit: I am really close with my family, specifically my mom and aunt. They know the wishes I have for my daughter. My husband and I argued about where our daughter should be buried for a good week. It was awful. He wanted her buried with his grandma and where his parents and him will be buried. I wanted her buried at the cemetery my grandparents are buried at and where I plan to be buried at. My husband is in the military so I’m confused as to why he does not want to be buried with his combat brothers but that’s entirely up to him. After this fiasco with his mother I put my foot down about where I would like my daughters final resting place to be. I just never thought it would be so much back and forth about where she will get buried, the week long trip we weren’t invited on or consulted about, and acquiescing his mothers wishes. Shit show to say the least. I love my husband but I am appalled by his behavior. I should also add that my family was very supportive about where I wanted my daughter to be buried at when the topic came up. They even said wherever we want because it’s not their choice. I even entertained cremation just to try and come to a middle ground of sorts. I didn’t even want to discuss burials and cremations until I absolutely had to. I’ve been avoiding it. Now it feels morbid to discuss it because my daughter is still alive. My husbands family was upset when they brought the topic up. Because I didn’t automatically want my daughter at their cemetery of choice. Their main argument was that my daughter carries their last name so she should go there. My argument was my family already has four open plots and I want to make one a double for me to be when my time comes. I’m even exhausted writing this. Because this is my life and it shouldn’t be. We should be a team. United in grief. Now I feel like all I have is my baby and my family to hold me up.",21410,wiq2ef,"**NTA,** obviously.

I have so much to say about this, but most of it would get me banned.

What kind of grandmother would suggest taking her DYING TODDLER GRANDDAUGHTER WHO IS ALREADY IN HOSPICE away from the child's parents for even ONE of these final precious days in order to spend time with her, rather than suggesting spending that time together as a family (including grandma, I mean)?!!

Worse yet, what kind of grandmother would threaten to waste precious moments of your last days with your daughter with a COURT CASE that no sensible lawyer will even consider taking, it's so ridiculous? Visitation rights are one thing, but the idea that she has a right to take your child, who is currently in hospice, away on vacation for a week without you, across the country, is absolutely ludicrous. No such rights exist. And for her to even be talking about wasting your time, energy, focus, and money on a court case, whether it happens or not, is beyond obnoxious.

There would be absolutely nothing wrong with her wanting to spend time with her granddaughter, or, as you so lovingly suggested, wanting to do a short trip together as a family ... something that your daughter could physically handle, and that would be a special memory. But this? This selfish nonsense? As if a not-quite-3-year-old would even WANT to be apart from her Mummy and Daddy when she feels rotten and everything is confusing? As someone who has been chronically ill most of my life, I can assure you . . . the way your daughter is feeling these days, she doesn't want to be ANYWHERE without you, not even with her grandma. Mummy and Daddy are her comfort and safety. 

You are NTA. Stand your ground. Your MIL is being horrifying, and there is no excuse for it.",1768,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wiq2ef/aita_for_telling_my_mother_in_law_my_toddler_will/
AITA for asking my husband to join us in my sister's birthday since he was in the same restaurant?,"
I f26 was invited to my sister's (18th) birthday few days ago at a restaurant. My husband didn't come because he said he had a meeting dinner with some clients. This made my family feel let down especially my sister who wanted him there and also her 18th birthday was a big deal to her obviously.



To my surprise, When I arrived I noticed that my husband was having his meeting at the same place, his table was right in the corner and he had about 4 men sitting with him. My parents and the guests saw him as well. I waved for him and he saw me but ignored me. He obviously was as much as surprised as I was.



My parents asked why he didn't even come to the table to acknowledge them after the cake arrived. I got up and walked up to his table. I stood there and said excuse me, my husband was silent when I asked (after I introduced myself to the clients) if he'd take few minutes to join me and the family in candle blowing and say happy birthday but he barely let out a phrase and said ""I don't think so, I'm busy right now"". I insisted saying it'd just take a couple of minutes and that it'd mean so much to my sister. He stared at me then stared awkwardly back at his clients. They said nothing and he got up after my parents were motionning for me to hurry up.


He sat with us while my sister blew the candles and cut the cake. My parents insisted he takes a piece and join us in the selfie but he got up and walked back to his table looking pissed. We haven't talked til we met later at home.


He was upset and starred scolding me infront of my parents saying I embarrassed him and made him look unprofessional and ruined his business meeting. I told him he overreacted since it only took few minutes and it was my sister's birthday and my family wanted him to join since he was literally in the same restaurant. He called me ignorant and accused me of tampering with his work but I responded that ignoring mine and my family's presence was unacceptable.


We argued then he started stone walling me and refusing to talk to me at all.


FYI) I didn't have an issue with him missing the event, but after seeing that he was already there then it become a different story.

Also it literally took 5-7 minutes. He didn't even eat nor drink. Just sat down and watched.",21410,z6w0l5,"Business meetings are not the same thing as dinner with friends where you can just excuse yourself for a moment to chat with your family. When you attend a meeting, it is expected that the people in it have cleared up their schedules so the appointment won't be interrupted.YOU know it was a coincidence, but your husband's business partners might be thinking you guys arranged the dinners to be in the same restaurant and that would damage his professionalism in their eyes. 

Also, you husband said he didn't want to attend the celebration, he said he had a business meeting, that sounds REALLY important, BTW,  and what do you do? You coerce him to participate anyway. I get why he blew up with you, OP, whether you realized it or not, you acted disrespectfully, unprofessionally and you may have jeopardized his career.

AITA for refusing to make my husband apologize for what he said to my mom at dinner table?,"So, I f31 recently got married to my husband Scott m36. Before I met him I was engaged to my former fiance Martin, but we broke it off because this relationship was sort of pushed by my family because he's a doctor and comes from a wealthy family. When our relationship ended mom was devastated. She did her best to bring us back together, For example she lied to Martin about me being pregnant to save ""us"". That was years ago now we're all on good terms including Martin. Mom has a bit of tension towards Scott, she treats him well but constantly makes passive, nagging comments about him. She compares him to Martin all the time which bothers both of us but we try to let it slide.

Mom kept telling Scott about the diamond ring, new car, and bank account Martin got for his fiancee and kept sending him photos saying how generous Martin is to his fiancee than compared him to Scott and what he had done for me. I told her stop doing this and she apologized.

Last week, we were over at my parents house for a social gathering, lot of relatives came and we had dinner. At dinner table mom asked Scott if he saw the text she sent him the other day, he said he was sorry and that he didn't notice. She told him to check it right then and read it out loud so everyone at the table could hear. He took his phone and started reading the text out loud. Her text mentioned how Martin got his fiancee a new house and how generous he was, then said that Martin is younger than Scott, yet was able to buy a house. Basically shaming Scott for his inability to buy a house. She wrapped up by saying that Martin maybe wasn't so bad for me afterall. I was shocked and Scott was pissed obviously, however, he didn't lash out or anything he looked at the text, smiled and said ""you know, what gets me about this entire text is how you were a public educator for 30 years, yet you can't differentiate between the passive ""you"" and the contraction ""you're"", Good God! The thought of all the children that must've been left behind!"". Everyone at the table busted into laughter and mom's face went pale. She decided to leave the table then she and my sister started yelling at me saying Scott was being awfully rude and I need to get him to apologize immediately forembarrassing mom at the table. I refused to tell him to apologize then pointed out how she was being judgemental towards him, she defended herself saying she was just letting him know and he had no confidence and took it personally. I left but kept getting told to talk to him and get him to apologize for what he did.",21381,tx7nhc,">she treats him well but constantly makes passive, nagging comments about him.

AITA for embarrassing my stepdad in front of his family saying he’s in *my* house?,"For the past few months I (17m) haven’t had a good relationship with my mom or stepdad. I’m angry at them because 2 years ago when my dad passed away he left me inheritance that I’m supposed to get on my 18th bday. I’m also getting survivors benefits that my mom uses for me when I need things so is not like she used this inheritance  for me. 

They bought a house that we moved into. It was weird for me because we always lived in a 3 bedroom apartment. My stepdad is a substitute teacher and my mom’s a part time reception.  They never even had enough to go for a vacation or something but all of a sudden they had for a large house out of nowhere. Mg mom looked guilty about it until she finally admitted they used some of what my dad left me to buy the house. I lost my shit. 

They tried to justify that it was for me too and I asked them does that mean they’re moving out when I’m 18 an the house is gone be in my name? And they’re like no. That’s what I thought. Supposedly the house was for my but max time I would’ve lived there was a few months. 

There’s still some money left if I went to a cheap college but still can’t believe they used my money for something on themselves. That amount could’ve helped me get my own damm house. Also think is funny since my stepdad didn’t like my dad because since I was spending more time with him that meant my mom had to pay a little in child support. 

But he doesn’t care using the money he left for me. Sorry if this a bit of a rant but where I’m asking it I was an asshole was last Saturday his family all came to stay at the house. They stayed Friday night so it was nxt morning when I’m getting ready to go to work. I made myself eggs in a hurry before I left my stepdad asked how come there wasn’t more for his family. And told him it’s because I’m already leaving for work there wasn’t gonna be time to make something for everyone. He acted like it’s not a big deal if I’m a little late since its rare they have people over at the house. 

We got back in forth because I’m not going to stop to make breakfast whne he can do it himself. Then he pulled that don’t talk to me like that in my house. Btw there’s no door in the kitchen and that leads right to the living room so they could hear all this. I said loudly actually it’s *my* house since you paid for it with my money and don’t forget they stole from me. 

My mom is expecting me to apologize for embarrassing him in front of his whole family because after I left they all had shit to say about it. They already went home by the time I got home but you could feel the tension. He straight up ignored me that’s how bad it was. I don’t feel like there’s anything for me to apologize for so that’s where she thinks I’m not being a good son and kind of an a-hole.

AITA for wanting to take my daughter fishing?,"For over a decade, myself and my four best friends have had an annual fishing trip. There has always been a ""no wives, no girlfriends rule"" since the beginning, and no one has ever violated it.

Two years ago, my friend ""Tim"" told the group he wanted to bring his five year old son, to sort of pass the tradition on to the next generation. At that point, only Tim and I had kids, but my daughter was three and two young for fishing. We all supported Tim's idea and made a big deal over the little guy. He had a great time and came last year as well.

My other friend, ""Randy"" has a four month old son now. When the baby was born, Tim gave Randy a children's fishing pole to give to his son on his fifth birthday. So it seemed clear to me that the tradition had evolved to us + our kids, which I'm cool with.

I mentioned to my friends the other day that my daughter was excited for this year's fishing trip and they looked at me like I was crazy. Tim said I shouldn't bring her, and I was baffled. I was super supportive of him bringing his son. This is no different. My daughter is now the age Tim's son was when he first came on the trip.

Another friend brought up the ""no wives, no girlfriends"" rule, which pissed me off. My five year old daughter isn't anyone's wife or girlfriend. I said if they don't want my daughter there, then I don't want Tim's son there. Tim was offended and stormed out. Randy said what I said was uncalled for. I said I'm bringing my daughter and that's that.

I just want to make sure I'm not being an entitled prick. AITA?

Update: I sent this post to my friends, and we talked some more. They ended up apologizing. Daughter is definitely coming on the trip.

I know many people assumed that my friends are sexist and horrible, but they're really not. They were just worried that with daughter there we would have to stay at a hotel instead of the usual cabin and not be able to do as many activities, but I assured them my daughter can sleep without air conditioning as easily as Tim's son and they are going to be the ones having trouble keeping up with her five year old energy.

Everyone apologized for bringing up the ""no wives, no girlfriends rule"" and agreed that was a shitty thing to say. It's all good now. Thank you for your support.",21347,vjzw38,"NTA. If I were you i'd ditch their trip and take your daughter on a fishing trip one on one. Clearly when they said ""no wives, no girlfriends"" they meant no females.

AITA for saying I’d call the police if a family heirloom wasn’t returned to my adopted daughter?,"On mobile and I’ve never posted here before so sorry in advance.

I (28f) met my husband X (30m) 10yrs ago. At the time, he was a single dad to a 6mo baby girl, Lily(11f). I worked at the bakery he’d stop at every Saturday before their walk, and eventually we started going out. We got married 6yrs ago, and I legally adopted Lily soon after that.

In my family, it’s a tradition that the oldest daughter gets gifted an old sapphire ring on her 11th birthday. The ring belonged to my grandmother, who gave it to my aunt, who gave it to me because all of my cousins are male. Lily’s 11th birthday was a few months ago, and I gave the ring to her because she’s my oldest daughter. She loves that ring more than anything. She put it on a chain to wear around her neck so that she could keep better track of it, and in the months that she’s had it, I’ve never seen her take it off.

My sister Mia (24f) is one of Lily’s favorite people. Lily really loves her aunt, and sometimes Mia will just text to let me and X know that she’s picking Lily up from school to go eat or go to the bookstore or something like that. The other day, I got one of those texts from Mia, so I just told her to be safe, have fun, and make sure my daughter came home at a decent time because it was a school night.
Lily got home about an hour after we had dinner, and she barely said hello to her dad or me before she went up to her room. I thought that maybe she was just tired, so he and I didn’t immediately ask her what was going on, but later that night I went to go check on her because I wanted to be sure.

When I walked into her room I saw that she had been crying. I asked her what was wrong, and it took a minute, but she eventually told me that Mia took the ring from her because it’s a *family* heirloom that’s supposed to go to the “actual” oldest daughter and because I adopted her, that means she isn’t really family.
The only reason I didn’t go to Mia’s apartment that night to get it back was because I spent the rest of the evening reassuring Lily that she is my family, and she is 100% my “actual” oldest daughter no matter what our DNA is or what anyone else says.

I left Mia a voicemail the next morning telling her to return the ring before I drive over there and get it myself. She texted saying she would only give it to me if I had a daughter before she did, but until then she’d keep it safe to make sure I didn’t give it back to “the wrong person”. So then I told her that if she didn’t return the ring by 2pm that day, I would be calling the police and reporting it stolen.

She started texting like crazy, saying I was being ridiculous and doing too much. Our mom is in on it now too and she thinks saying I’d contact the police was taking it too far, and that Mia was only trying to keep to the family tradition.",21353,xll1dz,NTA.

AITA for ruining my work colleagues wedding and getting them arrested?,"The title sounds bad, but hear me out.

I (38f) had 2 work colleagues, Mary and Adam (both in their late 20s-early 30s). Mary started in the company first and then she got Adam to join, they worked in different departments and Mary was in mine. Later, Mary left the company to pursue another carrier. When they started at the company, they were already married for a few years.

Now Mary is the kindest and loveliest person I've ever met. She was always polite, helpful and would cheer anyone up. We missed her dearly. So it came to a shock when we found out she is divorcing Adam because he has cheated on her. I have called her to express how sorry I am that this has happened to her and we were talking almost daipy ever since. I was impressed how well Mary holds herself in such situation, she wouldn't bad mouth Adam and the only thing she mentioned was how her wedding dress and a few family heirlooms went missing when she was moving her stuff from their apartment. She thought they might be misplaced in a different box and will turn up eventually.

A few years passed, I now work in the same department as Adam. He is a good work colleague but can be dismissive and ignorant sometimes. Adam invited me to his wedding with the lady, ""Chelsea"" he cheated on Mary with. As the entire department was invited, I said yes, making sure Mary is OK with this. I've also told her where the wedding will be. (It's not too far from where she lives and we could go for some drinks after if she wanted to)

On the day of Adams wedding, I have noticed that Chelsea is wearing a similar dress that Mary worn in the photos of hers and Adams wedding years ago. So without thinking I have snapped a picture and send it to Mary with the caption saying: ""doesn't this dress looks familiar?"". Mary saw the message but she didn't respond and about an hour later the police shown up at the venue. 

I need to add the police in our country is ruthless and any theft is considered a criminal matter for the police to deal with. Police has asked Chelsea to take the dress and all the jewellery off, Chelsea refused and started arguing with them, and then Adam joined in. As they were rude to the police, they were taken to the police station. Everyone at the wedding had to leave. I have tried to call Mary but she wouldn't pick up the phone.

As we found out later Chelsea was wearing Mary's wedding dress and her heirlooms, Mary spotted them on her in the picture I sent to her and called the police. Apparently, she has previously asked Adam if he had them, and he declined, saying he never saw them. So after she saw the picture she knew he was lying and stole them. Chelsea had to leave the wedding dress and jewelery at the police station and go home wearing her underwear and Adams jacket after they were bailed out.

Yesterday Adam returned to the office and went completely mental at me, blaming me for sending a picture to Mary and ruining his wedding, he would also call me an asshole for what I did.",21340,sl9xml,"NTA I can’t believe he would give his ex wife’s wedding dress and family jewelry to his new wife to wear in their wedding!

AITA for not sticking up for my grandmother after my wife told her to f- off out of her hospital room?,"About 3 weeks ago my Wife-33 went into premature labor with our daughter at 31 weeks. It was entirely unexpected and both my wife and our daughter had a horrible time and it became quite dangerous for the both of them. My wife became preeclamptic among other serious complications and for the first week we weren't even sure if either my wife or our daughter would make it. Luckily they both survived but our daughter is still in the nicu after 3 weeks and probably will be in for another 3, and my wife is still in the hospital as well.

It has been a horrible struggle for my wife. Before this she was a very healthy and active person and even during most of her pregnancy she was able to maintain a somewhat active lifestyle, but because of the trauma her body went through she is basically starting back from square one and hasn't even been able to hold our daughter yet. My wife has had a lot of struggles so far with her birth trauma and feels so confused and hurt by her experience. She told me that she feels betrayed by her own body and even in some of her weakest moments she even said she regretted getting pregnant entirely because of how much she has suffered and she is so worried she'll never be the person she was again. She feels horrible for having these feelings but I and multiple mental health professionals have been working to help and support her through this. 

We finally have reached a point where we can receive visitor's. Her family lives close but my family lives 3 states away and have been awaiting the chance to meet the baby and check in on my wife. My parents and grandparents flew down and I warned my family beforehand that my wife and daughter are still at very fragile stages and to be patient. When I brought them in to see my wife my grand mother immediately went and wanted to talk to her about the birth and her experience. My wife told her that it was one of the worst experiences of her life and my grandmother responded by telling her that the ""worst is yet to come"" and that struggling is what being a mother is about. My wife got very upset over this comment and started screaming at her to f- off and to get the f out. I had never seen my wife like this and I could tell she was feeling extremely stressed and I quickly escorted my family out. I told them it would be best if they left for now and we could talk later as not to cause even more stress on my wife. 

My family said they were ""appalled"" by my wifes behavior and me for not defending my grandmother, but at the end of the day I feel that it is my responsibility to be my wife's advocator all of the time but especially now. It has become a bit of a ""tension"" in my extended side of the family however, but I haven't told my wife about it because I don't want to stress her out and I plan to deal with this alone entirely.

"AITA for taking two of my nephews on vacation with me, but not the other?","I'm 36M, childfree. I have two sisters, Lisa and Annie. Lisa has two boys, 9M and 7M, Annie has a 8M and 1F. They both struggle financially a little and I have a good job. So this year, I offered to take my nephews to vacation with me this year (my niece is so small that I don't feel comfortable being alone with her at all, and Annie totally get that). 

I told my sisters to bring the boys to my appartment for a weekend, so that I can see if they'll get along and if I'm up for taking them to the seaside with me for 14 days. 

The boys came, and at first, we had a great time. I orderes us pizza, we watched a movie, played soccer etc. Next morning, I woke them up and gave them cereal, the 8yro throws the cereal on the floor and says ""I have waffles on the weekend"". I told him he can't have waffles for breakfast today, but we can make them for dinner or breakfast next day. He said he doesn't like cereal. I told him he can then just have some toast with peanut butter or some fruit. He yelled at me for not making him waffles. 

That day he also cut up my shirt because I didn't let him have cookies for lunch, and told me I suck for telling him to eat his veggies before I give them ice cream. He was nightmare. 7yro and 9yro behaved great. 

When my sisters came to pick them up, I told Annie what happened and she said "" oh he is just high spirited"". I told her I'm not taking him for vacation. I also told Lisa I'd be glad to take her boys with me, and they were super super excited. 

My parents and some aunts have been biting my head off for treating the kids differently and denying a boy to go to the seaside just because he misbehaved once.

AITA for demanding my husband to apologize for ripping the picture my son drew just becausw he didn't include his step brother in it?,"I (F33) have a son (11) from my former relationship with my ex husband. Currently I'm married to my husband (M37) ""Joe"" who has a (15) year old son.


My son isn't that close to his stepbrother for many reasons including age, interests, hobbies, etc,. My son likes to draw a lot. his stepbrother tends to rip his drawings whenever they get into a fight. Now siblings and stepsiblings fight constantly which is normal. what isn't normal is my stepson touching and ruining my son's drawings which take time and effort and sometimes...emotions.

My stepson apologized everytime he did it. and with the help of some boundaries I put in place, he no longer damages my son's drawings (I got my son a lock). Joe complained about me creating distance between the boys and suggested I should've let them resolve this between them.


My son drew a picture of me, Joe, and him and showed it to us. Joe got extremely pissed when he saw it and started scolding my son for not including his stepbrother. I got involved and told him off but he proceeded to rip up the picture in half then into smaller and smaller pieces. My son started crying and I snapped and yelled at Joe asking wth was wrong with him. he told my son to go upstairs because he was punished and his punishment won't be cancelled til he starts including his stepbrother in his drawings. I told him to stop but he told me ""stay out of it, you're the reason we're having this issue"" and said that I made the boys resent each other by enabling my son's unjustified hatred for his stepbrother and setting ""boundaries"" (he kept air qouting this word) that shouldn't be set between brothers. I reminded him of what his son has done that caused my son to exclude him. then told him that none of us even myself have the right to demand to be included in anything my son draws. It's his own thing and he gets the final say. I then demanded that he apologize to my son immediately. Joe sarcastically clapped and then said that If I keep this up, then my son will grow up to be Anti-social and soft. I went upstairs leaving him ranting about how this was basically my fault. I stayed with my son til he calmed down. Joe told me that by expecting him to apologize I'm not treating him as a parent and undermining his word.",21271,ukbmmq,NTA.

AITA for leaving my husband at the clinic and driving off?,"

Hello! 

I f26 have been together with my husband Austin m35 for 3 years. He Wes married before me but divorced his ex wife because she couldn't have kids.


Eversince I became pregnant he did a complate 180°, he became obsessed by constantly watching my every move and breathing down my neck. He even hung photos of the sonogram!.  He also came up with a list of what I'm allowed and not allowed to do, like not driving, not eating certain foods, not working but I stood my ground and continued working, also not wear high heels or watch certain shows or see family unless percausions were taken. It has been exhausting for me already but he has made it 10x worse.


Yesterday, he woke me up at 7am and said we had to go to the doctor, I asked why since I wasn't feeling sick and he said he just had a hunch and I had to skip work and go with him to the appointment just to make sure because he felt something was wrong. I said no but he went and called my boss and took the day off for me. I was just speechless but decided to just go to get it over with. We got there after he kept scolding me for things i did the night before that mightve caused a problem- but literally there was no problem. The doctor told us that but he asked her to check again and she did, he then asked her to check again then again...I couldn't take it when he asked her again, I just got up, took my bag and walked out and left him arguing with the doc. I got into the car and went home immediately. He kept calling then came home and started yelling at me for leaving in the middle of my ""examination"" and then leaving him at the clinic. I blew upand told him I couldn't stand his obsession anymore and that his paranoia made me feel paranoid and is beginning to affect my social life, mental and physical health and my livelihood. He looked at me then said that I hurt him with what I said and that he was just trying to make sure the baby was fine and I was being aggressive and irresponsible towards him AND the baby this entire time, he said I was acting like a neglectful mother when the baby isn't even here yet then left and turned his phone off. This morning he's acting distant and is expecting some sort of a apology for what I did.

AITA for refusing to leave the room when my husband told me to?,"


My husband's best friend (female) got the news of her dog's cancer days ago. My husband would call her everyday til yesterday when she visited.


I opened the door for her, greeted her then led her to the living room and went into the kitchen to get a class of water after my husband asked me.


I came back and didn't find them in the living room. Turns out they went into the guests room and the door was shut. I heard weeping/sobbing sounds coming from the inside. I knocked then got in and found them embracing each other crying. I stood by the door but my husband paused and told me to give them a moment. I gotta say that I did not feel comfortable with his request so I remained standing. He got up and started repeatedly telling me to get out. I told him it's my house and he can't tell me where I can and cannot stay. He got angry and told me to get out and we'll talk later but I refused. He asked what was wrong with me for not seeing how tense the situation was and for not giving them privacy. I told him that they did NOT need to shut the door for any reason nomatter what it was. We argued and she ended up leaving. He blew up at me afterwards calling me unbelievable and saying I had no respect for him and his friend who's going thtough a hard time and refusing to give them privacy. I told him how weird it was for them to shut the door just becsuse they were crying. He told me that I was petty and overbearing to act like this infront of her and stopping him from showing proper support.



Now he's completely gone radio silent and is acting like I kicked her out or treated her poorly.

Some context:

1: Ages of those involved are 26Female, 28Female, and 31Male.

2: She's been his best friend/sister like for over 8+ years.

3: She tends to be very emotional and highly sensitive.

4: We don't get along because she tends to be a boundary stomper and does/says things that make me feel like I don't know my husband as much as she does. She also compares us as well.

5: Initially, I did not want her to come to the house but my husband called her and told her to come since he didn't see her after the news was received til yesterday.",21201,yxrq30,"So I am the other woman in this scenario. My best friend is a guy and I actually introduced him to his wife (met her at a bar and was like omg I have a friend you would love, I was right ☺️). I stood up at their wedding on his side as a groomsmaid. We are pretty close. My guy friend and I also haven't always had a platonic relationship (all parties are aware so it's not weird or awkward, we just communicate and are adults). Just trying to set the stage of my relationship as a comparison because I really feel like I could be a wife's worst nightmare if I approached this differently. Speaking from the other side of this relationship I had to dramatically step back from my friend to let his wife feel comfortable with our friendship and shifted the focus of my friendship from him to the both of them. I treat them as a unit, go out of my way to reach out to his wife directly and we have nurtured a great friendship as a result. I love her just as much as I love him and we all have a great time when we are together. But I am absolutely not excluding her, especially not in her own home. 

I think your husband and his friend are out of line. Marriage changes dynamics of friendships and if one person (you) is not comfortable then the current dynamic isn't working and needs to change. Your husband's priority is and should always be you, his friend should support him in that. 

So your feelings are absolutely valid and I hope your husband respects you enough to realize that things need to change. ❤️",73,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yxrq30/aita_for_refusing_to_leave_the_room_when_my/
AITA for missing my FIL's funeral after my MIL booked my husband first class but me ecconomy?,"
Me f31 and my MIL don't have a close relstionship. She's civil towards me but can be a bit passive aggressive at times and we tend to disagree often times.


We live in a different state. FIL passed away suddenly and MIL told me and my husband to come attend the funeral. She booked our tickets to fly to her state. But the issue started when my husband told me that we couldn't sit together in the plane because his mom had booked him a first class ticket while I got ecconomy. I was flabbergasted by this. I tried asking him why but he urged me to ""suck it up, and we'll talk about it later"". In that moment, that particular moment I felt so much humiliation and contempt. I felt like she was treating me as less then even in her hard times. I decided to not go and just go back home. My husband was shocked by my decision to go home and tried to convince me to just go but I declined.


He went alone and I ended up missing the funeral. He was livid just calling m3 and texting nasty things calling me petty and spoiled. He said that I should be grateful his mom paid for my ticket to begin with then said that she doesn't OWE me a Goddamn thing. I argued about how she could've just booked us both in economy if money was an issue but he called me pathetic for thinking about it when his dad just died. He said it was cruel what I did and that his mom and family will never forget that I missed the funeral over ridiculous reasons.


AITA for going home over this? 

ETA. One of the reasons I didn't settle for the ecconomy ticket was because I wanted to sit next to my husband and support him. He sobbed the whole ride to the airport and I didn't want to leave his side. I was shocked when he told me we couldn't sit together, and how he said it like he had no issue with it.",21204,ydcy8i,"Absolute masterstroke by MIL.

AITA for refusing to let my boyfriend have my bank account info to make a purchase?,"

I f31 have been with my boyfriend m37 for 8 months. He has 3 kids and is a single dad. We're on pretty good terms regarding almost everything. When it comes to money and spending, we'd take turns to invite each other out weekly (we don't live together obviously).

Several times he had me pay for his kids purchases. I didn't make a big issue out of it for the sole reason that those purchases were relatively small, all I had to pay was $30-60.

The other day, he called me while I was at work and sounded like he was in a hurry. He said he just found the gaming device he's been looking for for so long and wanted to buy it for his oldest son. I asked what's this have to do with me, and he told me he was short on money and needed $300. He asked me to lend him the $300 and I hesitated but agreed. He asked for my bank account info so he could pull the money but I refused and told him to wait for me til I get there. He insisted and said he'd handle it, all I had to do was just send him my bank account info after I end the call with him. His insistence made me uncomfortable so I still said no and told him to either wait or I won't pay. He got mad at me saying he didn't get why I was acting like this. He got so loud I had to hung up.


I found him sitting outside after I went home. He was waiting for me and was extremely upset. He asked why I didn't just send him the account info so he could pull the money we agreed on. I told him I don't feel comfortable letting anyone have my personal info especially when it comes to finances . He got offended and said ""I'M NOT JUST ANYONE, I'M YOUR F'ING PARTNER!!"" Then went on a rant about how he ended up not paying the gaming device after looking for it for so long and now his kid is mad at him and it's my fault.

We had a fight then he left and told me I'd better have an apology for him AND his son next time I call his phone. .....I haven't call yet but I feel like I acted stupidly and irrationally. I think I should've just given him the info he asked for?.,,I don't know if I made the right decision.


**UPDATE:**

Wow so, I've left this thread after the first hour but got back to hundreds of people engaging...Wow I'm just amazed. And since many of you wanted to know what happened, I've went to his place and talked to him and his oldest son, turns out that the gaming device thing was a lie. He wanted the money for something else, to help pay for one of his buddies car repair. I was shocked when he confessed and said he had to lie and make it about his kids to get me to lend him the money. You can only imagine my reaction after this, I just blew up at him and left without giving him any chance to respond. He tried calling my phone (still trying) but I decided I want some space to think about what happened and really re-evaluate our relationship. It's true that he had me pay for the kids in the past but after what I found I wouldn't put it past him that those $30-60 purchases weren't for the kids as I haven't seen the stuff he said he bought for them. I'm in need of some space and quiet though I'm busy with work but I do my best to stay focused. I, quite frankly am no longer sure if I could move past this....it's just so unsettling that he has no issue lying to me and USING me for money like that. I love the kids, I ADORE thrm but him? He's hurt me with what I did and I'm not sure I could come back from it. I might just be upset right now and will need time...I don't know....yeah...I'm just going to do a lot of thinking regarding this situation and see what happens.

AITA for gifting my mom and her husband a book on cheating for their anniversary?,"I'm (16 M) and I love my mom (35) but when I was 10 she had an affair and left us, I visited her as often as I could and she always seemed so happy when I was there but I hated her new family so I stopped visiting. Honestly we rarely ever saw each other after just for my birthday and events really. She wants us to be close but I want nothing to do with her new husband so I've kept my distance.

Except on Feb 20th my dad announced he'd be out on business till the 12th and my grandparents are stuck visiting relatives in Italy and so I really had nowhere to go and my mom jumped at the chance to have me stay with her. And just my luck that my mom's anniversary with her husband was on Sunday.

I haven't had a good time here at all so all I do is stay in my room doing homework or go out with friends to avoid family activities cause it sucks seeing how lovey dovey she is with her husband and how they seem like the perfect family with their daughters. The morning before her anniversary day she came to my bed and tried to cuddle with me like before she left us but it made me angry like we can't go back in time and pretend it's how it was. So I just pretended to be asleep and stayed curled up and frozen till she left. I started crying cause of that and I felt angry and snarky and my mom majored in literature so I got her a copy of Anna Karenina for her anniversary. That book's about a lady who leaves her husband and son for her lover. I've never read it but I watched the movie with my girlfriend and I hated it.

The anniversary party was on Sunday. Everyone was having fun but me and then people gave their gifts. I gave mine and when my mom saw what it was she seemed shocked but just said thanks. The party ended like an hour after. But at night when she was in her room I heard her crying really loudly. So I kinda eavesdropped a little and heard her saying stuff about that book and me and her husband trying to calm her. The next day at breakfast she left for work early before I woke up and her husband straight up called me an asshole and other stuff for gifting them that. It's been a few days now and my mom has barely talked to me. Honestly I feel so wrong I made my mom cry but at the same time I don't want to be here and she knows that so am I really the asshole?

Edit:

Thankfully the mods have locked this. But to everyone who keeps DMing me here's some facts to read before you do:

* I gave my mom the book to try and get it across to her that I hate being at her house and being around her family and that it hurts me to be there because I sympathized with the son from the movie not because I want a train to run her over - I do not want that to happen to my mom
* I do not want my dad to get back together with my mom, he's happy with his fiancee
* My dad has his reasons for not wanting me to go to therapy and is just being protective
* Yes I stopped visiting my mom cause I hate her husband but she had custody of me on weekends or breaks she could've forced me to be with her but since being with him or making him be with us whenever I did go to her was more important she never tried anything beyond the bare minimum of going to big events.

1. You have a right to your damn feelings. Taking the cheating out of the equation, your mom hasn't apologized to you for leaving you. She hasn't apologized for being the catalyst for your whole life changing. That is wrong of her. It's also wrong of her to not talk about the divorce and the past with you, ""live in the now"" only works for people who aren't traumatized by what happened in their past. Another wrong thing she is doing - not getting to know you. Yes she is excited and happy and in love with her family and probably wants to share that with you, but she is oblivious if she thinks that she can just do that without talking to you one on one. Whatever happened between your mom and dad doesn't matter here, the way she is treating this situation is not okay. She is your parent, she is the adult, she is letting you down. You still love her, that's perfectly normal, but it's also good to acknowledge that she is not treating you fairly, or with the respect that your feelings deserve.

2. I don't know what the heck is going on with all the comments about your dad being abusive, he's got his own trauma too and that has to be respected. A lot of people don't trust the medical system for valid reasons (hello, residential schools), and it can be hard. If you want to go to therapy, and I do encourage you to talk to someone, discuss with your school counselor maybe some alternatives or maybe a session or 2 to start with your dad at first to ease his worries. At my high school we had a youth worker come down from the youth center every day at lunch and would talk to anyone who needed help, maybe there is something like that near you? Therapy is not just a therapist, it can also be art therapy, or music therapy - find what works for you. Group therapy also exists, maybe that would make you dad feel better?

3. For anyone not in Canada, a psychologist and a psychiatrist are super different here. Psychiatrists mainly prescribe medication and you get referred either through your family doctor or through a hospital. Psychologists have a doctorate and some may go to medical school (not a requirement tho), but don't typically prescribe medication. They mainly work privately, so you pay out of pocket for all costs.

4. Idk where you are in Canada but if you're in BC, please check out the Foundry. It can be all online if you want, but they offer so many services that may help. Kids Help Phone didn't work for me, but they're nation wide so give it a shot if you need to talk to someone, they also do text if you don't want to phone. Your school counselor also likely knows about more local resources that can help.

I'm giving you a big, big hug 🫂 These are hard problems you're dealing with, give yourself some slack. In this situation, your parents should be the ones guiding you, you shouldn't have to guide them - the fact that you're willing to shows maturity.",345,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t55npl/aita_for_gifting_my_mom_and_her_husband_a_book_on/
AITA for telling my wife she should get a nose job?,"I (31 M) love my (30 F) wife, we’ve been married for 3 years and there’s nothing I would change about her except that she’s really insecure about her nose and that she get aggressive over it when I try to comfort her.

I said that if she’s that insecure about it to the point that it’s affecting her mental health then she should get it done.

It’s really uncomfortable for me to hear her complains because we both have the same nose (big crooked middle eastern nose) so every time she says how disgusting and ugly she finds her nose to be it break my heart a bit because I can’t help but wonder if she feels the same way about my nose too",14167,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t3j1wt/aita_for_telling_my_wife_she_should_get_a_nose_job/
AITA for not getting on a flight upon finding out that he put my kids in economy?,"

So, my fiancee has 3 kids from his former marriage whilst I have 2, from my former marriage as well.


I quit my job to start focusing on getting my degree. He's become the ""breadwinner"" if you will although I still contribute with my savings! I also do 80% of child-care and chores.


Long story short, He wanted me and my kids to attend thanksgiving with his family who are located across country and we were supposed to go yesterday (ahead of time to get a rental place). He bokked our tickets and everything but later, before the flight I found out that he, his kids and myself were put in 1st class whilst my 2 kids (14) & (10) were put in economy. I was stunned, he acted like it was a no big deal and told us it's just few hours and the kids could ""just hang in there for a little while"". I asked how he could think this was acceptable and he got mad and said he's the one paying for tickets then we go by his rules. I immediately turned around and took the kids and made my way out of the airport. He started following us screaming at me to go back but I refused and told him that I no longer felt like spending thanksgiving with his folks after this. My youngest cried because she never flew without me.


He went with his kids. My and the kids are home. He has not stop calling trying to berate me and even had his mom text that I needed to get over myself and stop teaching my kids to be spoiled and entitled. She said that the fact that I was ""willing"" to miss thanksgiving with the family over something so trivial shows my real character and perseonality and mindset or ""lack thereof"". I have not replied but I feel horrible.

AITA, should I have just let it slide and just went? In case I wasn't clear, ME AND THE KIDS LEFT OUR FAMILY/HOMETOWN SO WE COULD GO CELEBRATE WITH HIS FAMILY IN HIS HOMETOWN. My kids weren't too excited leaving their granparents for a week or so.


**UPDATE I'm currently getting myself and the kids packed so that we go stay with my mother. This has happened BEFORE in other instances but I kept thinking to myself ""this is not right but I have invested too much time and effort in this relationship so maybe this shouldn't get in the way""..and I'd try to minimize most situations where I find my kids being put last. Not only that but he tried to give me an ultimatum regarding getting my degree and what was my response? ""This isn't right...."" but kept making light of it and letting go. Now he's probably badmouthing me to the whole family (and so is his mom, bless her effing heart)The kids and I are leaving, He'll be coming back to an empty home...except he'll find some company with the engagement ring that I took off and left on the nightstand. Distance and some re-evaluation is needed right now. Thank ypu to all who reached out with helpful input and prespectives. You're right, my kids come first and that's what I keep trying to do and I hope I won't ever fail. Thank you so much for the support.**",21016,ywyb7n,"NTA. First strike: wrong for him to segregate your kids downward. Second strike: wrong for him to seat minor children away from a parent without that Parent's knowledge.

AITA for walking out of the restaurant over a joke between my Fiance and his friend?,"
I f30 used to work as a sex worker in my early to mid 20s. not so proud of it but I had no choice. I had to get money to be able to keep my siblings and myself from homelessness.


I met my fiance Martin m32 over a year ago, he knows every single detail about my life and everyday tells me he loves me no matter what. His family are literally saints so I kind of hit the jackpot in the inlaws dept. However, his friends...not so much. some of them make comments about my past and throw in some words that I find rather offensive but I thought to myself ""giiirl you just being too sensitive, just let it go"". 


Last week we went out to the restaurant to celebrate Martin's birthday with his friends and family. One of his closest friends ""Antonio"" has a habit of making nasty jokes and laughing publicly. Martin was talking to his friends while I was talking to my mother inlaw talking. Antonio looked around and praised the restaurant and the atmesphere for the party. Martin nodded after Antonio told him he's lucky he got all that for his birthday then complained about not having family to celebrate his upcoming birthday. He then told Martin ""perhaps I can borrow (my name) for some bJ on my upcoming birthday"". I was appalled, but when I turned to see how Martin woupd react, Martin just laughed and said ""Hahaha well, how much are you willing to pay?"". I froze. Now I might have overreacted but I had a terrible look on my face as I looked at Martin. Then I got up, gathered my stuff including the gift I got him then started making my way out. My inlaws noticed and I could hear Martin yelling after me. He followed me outside begging me to wait but I kept walking. He said it was just a joke between him and his buddy and I was overreacting for no reason at all. I started arguing with him about how he was not only ok with his buddy humiliating me but playing along in his God awful joke. He insisted I overreacted and was being oversenstive. I got into a taxi and went home.


After he came back he started complaining about how I embarrassed him and ruined the celebration by walking out. I reminded him of what he did and he said it was just a joke! and the only one who has an issue with my past is me and I should seek therapy for being too sensitive all the damn time.",20966,ue4n5l,"NTA. Look, the joke was bad enough, but for my money this part is the dealbreaker:

Bottom line is: he fucked up and instead of acknowledging it, apologizing, and changing his behavior he decided that the ACTUAL problem is **you** for having feelings he doesn't like and for standing up for yourself. And that the real victim of his own bad behavior is **him** because you didn't laugh off your hurt feelings and discomfort so then he had to feel shame.

This is an absolutely dismal trait in a life partner. I would strongly, strongly reconsider staying with this person.

AITA for asking my parents why my wedding gift was significantly smaller than my sister’s?,"My husband and I (28M, 28F) got married recently, and my sister (31F) and I were discussing the wedding after returning from the honeymoon. We are very fortunate to have grown up in a household where my parents made very good money. They were generous with us, but raised my sister and I to be hard-working and not dependent on them as adults. My sister and I both do well financially as does her husband (36M). My husband loves his job, but it is not one that has a ton of earning potential. He and I met in college, so I’ve always known this was his plan and we are very happy with our setup. 

During my discussion with my sister, she asked me if my husband and I were planning to use the wedding gift money from my parents to do a particular renovation for which we’ve been saving, but I was very confused because the gift, while extremely generous and appreciated, wasn’t nearly enough to cover that. She told me how much she had been gifted and it was more than twice what we had been given. After that I couldn’t stop thinking about why I had gotten less, so my sister encouraged me to ask, and during a call with my mom I couldn’t stop myself from asking. Her response was that it wasn’t my business, but since I did ask, my sister has chosen a partner that can accommodate the lifestyle she’s used to, so they’ve gifted her accordingly. They also gifted me according to the lifestyle I’ve chosen. We are not entitled to gifts of any size in life, but I still can’t help feeling hurt that my parents feel that my husband and I are less deserving than my sister and her husband based on income. Meanwhile my parents are angry at both my sister and me for having this discussion and bringing it to them. 

Tl;dr: My sister accidentally revealed that our parents gave her a considerably larger wedding gift, now they are mad at me for bringing up this topic.",20948,wslrqr,"NTA, and I don’t understand your parents’ reasoning.

AITA for ruining someone’s day during my wedding?,"Throwaway account because I’m aware that I have relatives who do use reddit.

I (26F) recently just got married a few days ago. It was a traditional punjabi wedding and I had an absolute blast. For some context, I have 3 brothers and no sisters. In traditional indian weddings, there are certain ceremonies where you would need your female relatives to be a part of. Since I have no sisters, my cousins stepped in. My families have always had a strained relationship with one another, always due to some petty fights that occurred years ago that some of the relatives just can’t let go of. Most of the cousins don’t partake in this because we’re aware that it’s ridiculous.

I have one cousin I’ll name X (18F) who is extremely nice but unfortunately super shy and timid. She has always been like this and most of us have just grown up being protective of her, especially since she is one of the youngest cousins. 

During one of these ceremonies, I insisted that my cousin be a main part of it because I know she would genuinely enjoy it but would be to shy to volunteer herself or ask for it. One of my cousins fiancée’s (28F) however, is quite the opposite. She constantly likes to put herself in the middle of everything, despite already being told of her given duties during the ceremony.

This is the part where I may be the asshole. During one of the ceremonies, you are supposed to have one of your female relatives sit behind you on stage and basically just take care of you, fix your hair or your clothes etc. I specifically told cousin X that she would be the one to do this for me. 

However, when the day came, my cousin’s fiancée was the one who took her spot. I was confused but could not do much. After the ceremony, I found cousin X and she explained to me that the fiancee who took her spot had basically scolded her and yelled at her, saying that she should be the one doing it since cousin X is still young and doesn’t know anything. She then told cousin X to go sit down with the other guests, despite cousin X’s protests. Cousin X’s mother (my aunty who I absolutely adore and has been a huge help with the wedding) was quite upset with this but did not want to cause a scene and just told cousin X it’s okay.

When I heard this, I was furious. The fiancée took what was meant to be a special moment and made it all about herself. I sat the fiancée down and told her that she had no right to do what she did and I was extremely upset with her for doing so. Apparently she was so upset by this conversation, she refused to come for the other ceremonies the next day. I was fine with this, because I generally don’t like adults who throw temper tantrums but my cousin says that I had no right to speak to his fiancée like that and now his entire family has been constantly saying a lot of negative things about my family and the whole situation.

AITA for embarrassing my brother infront of the whole family?,"I(36M) am married to a wonderful woman(34). When we first got married 8 years ago, I was making about $36k and she was making $230k.

Fast foreward a year and we welcome a sweet baby girl. After her maternity leave was up, I took my vacation to stay with my baby. Well I found out that being a dad and taking care of the house is 1000 times better than working in a stressful office. We discussed it, and I became a full time SAHD.

I like being a SAHD. I even enjoy keeping the house clean, cooking, taking care of the kids (7F, 4M and 1M), being involved in the mom groups, little league...etc.

The only person who seems to have a problem with things is my older brother (44M). I don't know how, but despite being raised by parents who are very much champions of equal rights, he grew up to be the embodiment of ""man provides and guides, woman makes home and follows"". Which is why he is a 2 times divorcee who has terrible relationships with his kids.

For the past 7 years he has been making jokes about me, trying to emply that I am less of a man because my wife earns money while ""I play little wife"". I ignore him if I'm in the mood to, or just shake my head at him.

Well my wife and I were drunk one time and we came up with a bit of a naughty solution. He gives major vibes of being a prude (and is casually homophobic TBH). So when he made a joke last Sunday along the lines that ""if you were married to a man, you would 100% be the bottom"" I hit him with ""funny you say that, I am a bottom. 'wife' really knows gow to use a dildo and harness to make a man see the starts"".

He turned so red, everyone kind of let out a shocked laugh and he finally shut up. After a while he said that he did not want to hear about what I do with my wife in our bedroom. I said if he keeps his comments to himself, I would have no reason to share.

But today mom called me to say that he refuses to attend Sunday dinner if I am there unless I apologize. I refused to and mom is now the one feeling bad. So AITA?",20925,w9kml8,"Haha this is amazing.

AITA for embarrasaing my fiancè and taking my heels off at our engagement party?,"
My fiance (m31) and I (f26) got engaged several days ago. This is relevant, he's tall and I'm in the 5's category, pretty small compared to him and his family. He asked that I wear high heels at our engagement party since there was going to be photos. Although I wasn't comfortable (not a fan either) with high heels, I decided to wear them just for his sake since he begged and pleaded. and also since he promised I would be sitting most of the time. But at the party he had me stand for hours to welcome the guests (there were like 20 guests) with him. I got so tired of standing and my feet and legs were on fire. I asked if I could sit but his mom said I'm the fiancee and should stand next to my partner not just sit like the party had nothing to do with me.


I told my fiance again that I was in so much pain but he said ""suck it up, it's almost over"". I had enough of it, I took my heels off and let my feet and legs cool off. He and his mom looked at me in utter confusion. Several of his family and guests saw me barefoot as well. He freaked out asking what I was doing. his mom asked that I put my heels on but I said my feet were done and I couldn't do it anymore. my fiance begged me but I stood there til it was over like he wanted. The minute I got in the car he flipped out.. saying I embarrassed him infront of family and friends by standing there barefoot and refusing to put my heels back on even after his mom repeatedly asked. I reminded him that he said I wouldn't be standing but turns out it wasn't true. He argued that for someone with a height like mine, then I should wear high heels more often, and said should've sucked it up for his sake. he went upstairs and turned his phone off and refused to speak to me.


I had no intentions of embarrassing him and I do feel I should've sucked it up. but I think that he wasn't truthful about how long I was expected to stand. Aita?

AITA for losing it on my husband for lying about an emergency to get me to leave my brother's wedding early?,"

My husband has been sick for few days. He got sicm around the time of my brother's wedding. I took care of him 24hrs for days. He's on meds and can move and go to the bathroom and eat on his own. I told him I was going to my brother's wedding and he threw a fit saying I couldn't leave him alond while he's sick. I told him he was not that sick, it's just some stomache that he's getting treatment for and suggested he call his sister to come stay with him. He said no and told me to miss it. I got upset and bluntly said no and that he could survive for few hours while I attend the wedding. He sulked and as I was leaving, he said he hoped I won't ever come back. It hurt my feelings but I know he was just mad and didn't mean it.


At the wedding, I got a text from him saying he lost balance and fell off the stairs and hurt his back. He said he was in a lot of pain he threw up and couldn't move, and insisted I get home asap. I freaked out and started calling his phone but he didn't answer. I thought ""he must've passed out"" and I freaked out even more. I got in my car and drove back to our house immediately.


When I got home, I rushed towards the stairs while calling out his name but he wasn't there. I started to really freak out. I rushed into the bedroom and found him in bed drinking juice and soon as he saw me he put the phone down. I instantly knew he lied so I lost it on him and started yelling saying he freaked me out and caused me to miss my brother's wedding for nothing...absolutely nothing. He said that he already told me I couldn't leave him alone in the house and that this ""very scenario"" could've happened if I stayed there any longer. I yelled at him calling him horrible which made him cry. He started crying and throwing his juice all over the place. I had to step out and call his sister thinking she'd come help but she came and started cussing me out saying I had a lot of nerve expecting her to back me up after I so carelessly left her brother alone af the house in that state just to attend a party. We got into an argument and I went to stag with my family. My brother understood whrn I explained the situation to him. My husband and I haven't seen each other since then but his sister kept saying I had no right to scream at her brother and cause him a panic attack and said that he at least was clear with me from the start but I chose to be dismissive.

AITA for giving my brother and his wife 2 days to return my piano?,"

I f32 developed an interest for piano after meeting my late husband who was a piano teacher for 7 years. He taught me to play it and he helped me buy one (used one but still a bit expensive) 2 years ago.

I play it everyday, after his passing (6 months ago) I just find comfort spending time playing. However, my brother and his wife (who came to stay with me for 2 months after loosing their apartment) always complain about the piano noise although, I only play at daytime. SIL and I started arguing more frequently and my brother told me to only play it when they're out but I refused.

Yesterday, I was out with friends for the day then I came in the evening, I found that my piano was gone. Turns out my brother had moved it to a friend's garage (I don't know which friend) while I was gone. I blew up at him and yelled that he had no right to touch it or move it. His wife said they did this as a last ditch effort to get some ""peace and quiet"" in the house. My brother reassured me that he'll give it back once he finds his own place and I get to live alone and play the piano all day long. He was sarcastic in his last line and couldn't take it. I told them to pack and leave my house because they were no longer welcome after this. He freaked out and tried begging me to take it easy and be more rational, but I threatened to call the police if they refused to leave.

He took his family and left, The piano still isn't back and they're saying they'd give it back if I agree to let them move back in (basically wanting things to go back to how ghey were when they were complaining about the noise). They believe that what happened was a misunderstanding and everyone of us mishandled the situation so they want to start new. I lost it and told them they have 2 days to return it or I'll call the cops on them. Mom is pressuring me to take them back saying it was my fault for not have any consideration for them as my guests to begin with, but I refused to take them back and put my foot down on the time-line I gave. Now I'm being called irrational and cruel to kick my brother out, watch him struggle and refuse to let him move back in and choosing to escalate this to the authorities when I could just let them move back in and I get my piano back.",20886,y16i36,"NTA. I'm shocked that anyone, especially your own mother, would condone the assholeyness of your brother's behavior. This was not his home, it was yours. This was not his property, it was yours.

Apparently that's where your brother learned his poor behavior from.

AITA for cutting off support to my daughter?,"I (52M) have three children with my ex Tracy (50F), Michael (28M), Linda (25F), and Victoria (23F). We split because Tracy had an affair with Stan (55M) to whom she is now married. We never shared with the kids the reason for the divorce as I didn't want them to blame either of us.  

This backfired as the kids saw their mom move out of the house, into a small apartment, and me keep living in the house and remarry two years after the divorce. So they saw me as the bad guy. Stan and Tracy let them pretty much do whatever they wanted and I had to be the disciplinarian who made sure homework was done, appointments were made, and deadlines were met.  

My two oldest eventually came to realize that I was not the bad guy. My son when he found out that his mother had put nothing away for college for him as outlined in our divorce decree and she told him to take out loans. My daughter when she realized that her grades were going to keep her out of her desired program in school.  

My youngest never came around. So it was a surprise when her boyfriend asked for my blessing to ask for her hand. When I expressed that I didn't think she'd care about my blessing he said she insisted on it.  

She began spending time with me, being polite to my wife, and it felt wonderful to have my daughter back. I went with them to book the venue, and they'll be getting married next summer. I paid the deposit and the first installment.  

I noticed that she was becoming less communicative again recently, ignoring my texts or giving one word replies, and not coming over as much. On Monday, my son sent me a post from Instagram. My youngest had an engagement party this weekend to which I was not invited. One of the photos was her with Stan and it read, ""Anyone can be a father. It takes a real man to be a Dad. This amazing guy has been my dad for 15 years even though he didn't have to be. I am so blessed to have him walk me down the aisle next year! #daddysgirl #futuremrsx""  

My kids wanted for nothing their entire lives because I never let them go without. Even when they wouldn't talk to me, I made sure their needs were met. I texted Tracy to ask why I was not included. She replied that Victoria didn't want my wife there because she wanted a drama free day. My wife has literally never started drama in her life. I asked if Stan and I would both be walking her down the aisle. Tracy didn't respond, but Victoria called me up demanding to know what my problem was.  

I repeated my question and she replied that no, Stan, her dad, would be walking her down the aisle. I told her that if that's what she wanted I would be fine with it. I told her to let Stan know the next payment for the wedding is due in November.  

Stan and Tracy do not have the money for this wedding and think I'm being an asshole. Linda says if I do this, Victoria will never speak to me again. Michael is on my side.",20880,ws5bc6,"NTA, and your title is wrong. You aren't cutting off support, you're declining to pay for the remainder of the wedding expenses when you are going to be disrespected at the event.

AITA for yelling at my husband when he ate some of my chocolate and making him drive across the city to replace them.,"I am 8.5  months pregnant and driving sucks.  So my mom drives me around because my husband is working huge hours to get ahead before the baby comes.  

Last month she drove me to my favorite chocolate store and I stocked up on my favorite flavors.  The store has dozens of flavors of chocolate individually wrapped in colorful foil so you can tell the flavor.  The store is about an hour's drive away from our home.  

My husband knows my favorite flavor. Half the bag was originally that flavor but by now it's just even with the others.  

He came home from work yesterday and after supper we were going to sit and watch tv.  I waddled over to the couch and asked him to please bring me two of my chocolates.  He did and he grabbed a few for himself.  No problem there.  

He came back to the couch with chocolate in his mouth.  When he kissed me I knew what flavor he took.  He admitted he took the stracciatella ones.  My favorite. 

I got kind of upset and he said it was no big deal, I could go with my mom and get some more.  

Yes this company sells their chocolate everywhere but that flavor I've only ever seen this flavor in their store.  

I asked if he has been eating that flavor a lot and his face told me everything I needed to know.  I yelled at him that it's not like it's easy for me to sit in a car for two hours.  He said he would go out right now and replace them.  

He hit a couple of drug stores, and a couple of grocery stores they all told him the same thing.  So he drove across town and came back with a big bag of just that flavor.  

While he was gone I called my mom and she said I need to calm down because my hormones are making me crazy.  

I apologized to my husband but he is still grumpy that he drove around for hours just to get me chocolate.  

I think he should know better than to eat my favorite flavor.  

I know this isn't as big  a problem as some of the other stuff here.

  My husband is wonderful and he went out looking to replace my chocolate.  After he didn't find it nearby HE CHOSE TO DRIVE ACROSS TOWN.  I didn't force him to do it.

AITA for not defending my bf when my brother asked him to leave,"My (28F) boyfriend (27M), Ryan, likes to help others. He is the type of guy who would give a coworker money for their rent or buy groceries for our neighbor. However, he can take it too far at times. He often tries to help people without asking if they need or want his help. 

Every year, my brother (35M), Paul, and his wife (33F), Lily, host a holiday dinner. This year Ryan attended for the first time. Before we left for their house, I told Ryan that Lily was legally blind and had been her entire life. She knew what she could and could not do. I told Ryan to only help Lily if she asked for help.

We arrived early so I could help Paul and Lily cook. While we were cooking, Ryan kept telling Lily things, like “Lily, if you’re looking for the salt, it’s to your right” or “Lily, don’t put that there, it’s too close to the edge.” Lily and Paul both told him that while his commentary was somewhat helpful, it was completely unnecessary. Still, Ryan did not stop. 
 
However, things became tense when Lily went to go chop vegetables. When she pulled out a knife, Ryan stopped her and asked if he could take over because he didn’t want Lily to “hurt herself.” Lily said she’d be fine, but Ryan insisted she give him the knife. Finally, Paul got annoyed and told Ryan to stop. Ryan did stop, but he kept hovering over Lily while she was chopping. 

I asked Ryan to sit down until dinner was ready, but Ryan insisted that he just wanted to help. Finally, Lily asked him and I to help set the table and greet people arriving. We did, but things were still tense. 

I did pull Ryan to the side and reminded him again to only help Lily if she asked for it. He agreed, but I could tell that he was still upset. 

Everything finally boiled over after dinner. My nieces (5 & 3) have a game they love to play with their mother. They will hand Lily something, and Lily would have to guess what it is. Lily would sometimes make a couple of clearly outrageous guesses (like saying an egg is an elephant or a shoe) to make her daughters laugh. 

After dinner, the eldest handed Lily the salt shaker. When Lily guessed it was a phone, Ryan piped up and said it was a salt shaker. Lily laughed it off and explained the game to Ryan, but I could see she was annoyed. My niece then handed Lily a coin. When Lily guessed incorrectly, Ryan loudly told Lily it was a coin. This was apparently the last straw for Paul. 

Paul demanded that Ryan leave since he clearly couldn’t respect Lily. Ryan insisted that he was trying to be helpful. However, Lily said it was probably best if Ryan and I left. I quickly gathered up our things and managed to convince Ryan to leave. 

Ryan is currently pissed at me. He said I should have defended him, especially since I knew he was only being helpful. He also insisted that I should have stood up against Paul’s “overreaction” (Ryan’s words). I’m now wondering if I should have defended Ryan.

AITA for returning my stepdaughter's birthday gift because she didn't save a cupcake for my daughter?,"I'm, f33 engaged to my fiance, m36. I have a 4yo daughter and he has a 16 yo daughter.


He comes from a conservative family so we won't move in together til after marriage. So far we're on good terms as a blended family. But I noticed that my stepdaughter acts kind of distant towards my daughter. Everytime I try to talk to my fiance about it he'd tell me to give the kids a chance to bond and warm up to each other.


My stepdaughter's 16th birthday took place on sunday. Since she's into baking. She decided to bake cupcakes instead of having an actual birthday cake.

My daughter and I went over to my fiance's house to attend the party and I brought my stepdaughter a gift which was an iphone.

We sat down as she started serving everyone cupcakes. Then when it was my daughter's turn, she bluntly said she was sorry but she didn't save any for my daughter. I felt confused, I asked if she made enough cupcakes and wether there were guests that came uninvited. She said no and that she just didn't make one for my daughter. I asked why, she refused to say. I was so mad and felt hurt on my daughter's behalf. I got up and told my fiance that I wanted to leave. My fiance tried to stop me and offered his cupcake to my daughter but I refused to take it. On the way out, I grabbed the gift I brought for my stepdaughter and she stood there and watched. I could hear her yell ""dad she took the iphone"" while I was walking out with my daughter. My fiance tried to get me to go back inside but I refused.


Later, He came over and we had an argument. He said that I overreacted, and that I know how some teenagers can be moody and do random stuff without an explanation so I shouldn't have taken it personally. I said she excluded my daughter and didn't save her a cupcake but he said it was just a cupcake and then reminded me that he offered his cupcake and said I should've accepted it and called it a day. He said taking the iphone *which was supposed to be a gift* back was poor taste and it might hurt my relationship with his daughter. I refused to give it to him so he could give it to her since she was crying about it. He left and was mad at me.

We haven't talked since then except via texts.

Edit# She's been wanting the iphone for a while and since her dad couldn't buy it I decided it'd be nice if I gifted it to her.

For those who are asking how a teenager could own an iphone. ???? I'm sorry if it's uncommon where you live but where I live, Iphones are the most common phones.

also, I saw that she served her girlfriend a whole plate of cupcakes so it's not like she baked a specific number.",20770,y2exrh,I don't think you guys should get married.,2221,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/y2exrh/aita_for_returning_my_stepdaughters_birthday_gift/

My husband's mom moved in with us a week ago. The minute we were informed she was going to move in (temporarily til her house gets renovated) we've emptied a room specifically for her - it has everything. A bed with a frame, curtains, mounted TV, wardrobe etc. She was thrilled with it and loved it a lot.


One day I came home and found her in my bedroom sleeping in mine and my husband's bed. I was confused but she told me she took a nap on the bed and lost track of time. Since then she started talking about how she loved the nap there and started hinting wanting to take maps in the bedroom from now on.

I kept ignoring her comments til my husband sat me down and told me that his mom really liked and ""got used"" to napping in our bedroom and we should just let her have her daily afternoon nap in the room. I said ""absolutely not"" and we started debating. I told him his mom is being ridiculous because she has a whole room upstairs where she should nap. He got upset and said that I was making his mom feel uncomfortable and unwelcome with this attitude. I said NO and refused to negotiate. He called me selfish and mean for saying no and preventing his mom from feeling comfortable at ""his house"" but I reminded him that I pay full mortgage for the house while he blows money over gadgets and consoles. He accused me of bringing old disagreements in this current conflict to use against him. I said no again and that he should stop pushing because I need the room for when I get home feeling exhausted from working on my feet from 6am.

He's refusing to speak to me til I agree and let his mom have her nap in there. AITA for choosing this hill to die on as he says? Am I being difficult?.",20767,w2akhj,"You state that you ""were informed"" that his mother was ""going to move in (temporarily....)""

It doesn't sound like this is something that you offered, or were even asked about. So that's an issue to begin with. 

But on to your question. No, absolutely NTA. Your marital bed is sacred space. NO ONE should enter a married couple's bedroom except the spouses without an explicit invitation. How dare she be so entitled as to just march in and help herself to your private space?

AITA for not returning to my childcare job because the mother fired me over a mistake?,"I (19 M) had a job taking care of two kids (2M, 3F), a dog, and doing light housework 4 days a week for a single mom who got my contact info from a business card I had posted in my dad's pediatric therapy office.

Ever since the weather started getting warmer, the dog has been shedding like crazy. Like, I would vacuum the couch and the next day it would look like I hadn't, I would lightly tug on the dog's hair and would pull out huge tufts, the dog's been scratching all the time, etc. My dad's dog has a double coat like theirs, and one morning when I was leaving for work I packed his brushing tool in my bag. When the kids were napping, I spent a full hour outside brushing the dog.

The dog seemed to enjoy being brushed, and after an hour there was a huge pile of hair that had been brushed out. Before I vacuumed it up, I sent the mom what I thought would be a funny text saying, ""Brushed a whole new dog out of \[Dog\]'s coat!""

Looking back, I realize that maybe I should have asked first, but at the time it seemed like something that was within the scope of caring for the dog. The mom went ballistic. She called me yelling, saying that by brushing the dog and not letting the hair fall out on its own I was causing harm to the dog. She said I was an idiot and she can't believe she trusted me with her kids, and that today was my last day. I was extremely upset because I had been with the family for 3 months and she had never yelled at me like that before. I left as soon as she got home because she was still fuming. I immediately lined up a job with another family and am supposed to start Monday.

The mom who yelled at me called me two days later saying that she was sorry about the ""misunderstanding"" and that firing me was an overreaction. I told her I was no longer available and she started crying about how hard it was to find a new sitter for ""special needs"" kids (her kids are autistic and have therapy at my dad's office). When I stood firm, she started texting my dad and asking him to do something. My dad is annoyed at being dragged into this, and while he respects my decision he wishes I would keep watching her kids for a short time to ""keep the peace"". I hate that I put anyone in an awkward position, but I also don't want to work for someone like that. AITA?

AITA for kicking my friend out of my bedroom so my wife could take a nap?,"Throw away account. So, I 28M have a wife 27F who works full time as a CNA while she is in school to become a an autopsy technician. She works a LOT. She is constantly picking up extra shifts working doubles and even triples. She does all that on top of going to school full time. Because of that she often takes a nap after work. Well yesterday, I had a friend over who I will call E. My wife and E do not get along as E makes her uncomfortable but she and I don’t prevent one and other from seeing friends just because one of us doesn’t like the others friend. E was over at mine and my wife’s house playing video games when my wife calls to tell me she’s on her way home from work. She sounds exhausted and I asked her if she felt ok to drive and if not I’d come pick her up from work and go back together the car later. She says she’s fine to drive and that she’ll see me later. I said ok and told her I loved her. E and I go back to playing video games. It is worth mentioning that the only tv my wife and I have is in our bedroom. I was laying on the bed playing And E was sitting in my desk chair. About 15 minutes or so later I hear my wife come in the house and call out to let me know she was home. I come into the living room and give her a kiss. She all but collapses into my arms exhausted to the point she couldn’t even walk to the bedroom. I ask her if she’s ok and she says is yea just a long day at work. I really need a nap. I nodded and told her to come lay down in the bed. When we get to the bedroom I politely tell E that he needed to leave as my wife was exhausted and we could play later that night. E asks why he needs to leave and why my wife can’t just sleep while he and I keep playing. I explained that it was just a game and that my wife and her needs came first. E then asks why my wife couldn’t just take a nap on our living room couch. I told him I wasn’t making her sleep on the sofa just because he wanted to keep playing. E gets pissed and slammed his controller down on the dresser and goes to leave. Before he does, he turns to my wife and tells her I’ll bet your happy he always feels like he has to pick you over anyone else. He leaves and slams the door on the way out. My wife turns to me and starts to apologize saying she could have just slept on the couch. I tell her no she couldn’t have and tell her to get some rest. Later that night my other friends are blowing up my phone saying things along the lines of bros before hoes and saying it was rude to kick e out just so my wife could sleep. All of my married friends however are on my side saying my wife’s needs come first before my friends. E is now saying he won’t speak to me until I apologize. So am I the asshole?",20739,u4r55j,NTA but why are you still friends with him? Making somebody uncomfortable and not liking someone are two entirely different things.

AITA for kicking a server out of my wedding?,"I(25f) and my Husband (30M) and I got married last Friday. We planned our dream wedding down to our dream catering company. 

The wedding was beautiful after the pictures we headed to our cocktail hour, and that's when I saw her. My guest were all told to wear dark colors so my husband and I stood out, I also asked my guests to wear minimal makeup. I had assumed that applied to the staff too. 

The server(19ishf) had on clearly too much eyeliner.  she also had diamond studs in her ears a flashy ring, and one of those ugly nose studs. The staff's uniform was a black long-sleeved shirt but on her, it was too low cut and her pants were far too tight. 

It was super distracting. she was walking around serving drinks and talking to my guests. I asked another member of the staff to speak to their boss. when their boss came out I pointed out the server and asked that she be dealt with cause she was super distracting. their boss apologized and called the server back into the kitchen. 

not even an hour later the server was back out serving food for dinner. I called the boss over again and asked if the server could work in the back or go home. Her boss said they were short-staffed tonight so she would see what can be done. 

after a couple of hours of not seeing her, I saw the server again behind the bar. I called the boss out one last time and told her if the server didn't leave I would be calling the cops. the boss finally relented and told the girl to go home. 

&#x200B;

My husband and mother-in-law said I was acting crazy and that I probably got a poor college kid fired over nothing. My mother and MOH said it's my wedding so I can do as I please. It's my wedding and I don't want someone over-shining me and the server should know she's at work and not dress up so much. I do feel kind of bad because she was pretty young.

AITA for telling my sister I am never babysitting for her again?,"I (37M) am single, childfree and have two dogs (German Shepherd mixes). They are very well behaved and super nice, my niblings (aged 2-13) love them. 

I have 4 sisters and they have 10 kids total, so I babysit A LOT. I work from home and am pretty much always available to watch the older ones (since I can easily work while they are in my appartment) and when they need care for the little ones, I just move my schedule around a bit. 

Yesterday 4 of my niblings were at my place (ages 3, 5, 7 and 8). 7 and 8 are siblings. 

I have just one super strict rule at my house: no chocolate. It's deadly for dogs, I don't like it anyway and kids can easily go an afternoon without it. 

The 7 and 8yro obviously brought chocolate with them and shared with 3 and 5yro. I was in the kitchen making them drinks, they were in the living room. My dogs were sleeping on the balcony. 

I came into the living room and there were obviously chocolate crumbs everywhere. I asked who had the chocolate and 7 and 8yro admitted that mom gave it to them and they always have some with them, but usually eat it in secret. 

When my sister came to pick them up a few hours later, I told her what happened and she said that her kids are big enough not to make a chocolate mess. I told her I'm never babysittinv for her again.

She is furious and says I overreacted. Another sister of mine agrees with her. My mother thinks I am wrong for putting my dogs before the children.

AITA for refusing to pay for my husband and his family's meals at the restaurant?,"

Title sound bad I know but I'll let you decide who's in the wrong.

To begin, My husband and I don't share finances, it's been like this for the 3 years of our marriage and so far we've been doing well, though he'd sometimes try to get me to pay for him but I do it only when I want to do a nice thing for him, say invite him to a restaurant.


This past week, he got a bonus at work, he was overjoyed he informed his entire family and planned for them to go out and celebrate with us. He picked the restaurant, meals, drinks etc, I naturally thought he was going to pay for all that since, it's his happy celebration. But it turns out I was wrong because when it was time to pay the bill, he told me to ""take care of it"" I said why? It's his celebration not mine but he insisted I pay and he'll explain later. I refused and demanded an explanation, he said that while yes he is the one who got bonus, but he assumed I'd want to celebrate that and offer to cover the bill. when I talked about how ridiculous it was of him to assume I'd pay for not just his, but his family's meals he said that I should be happy for him instead of being visibly bitter. He then said he's yet to receive his bonus and begged that I take care of the bill now and he ""might"" consider paying me back later. I refused and only paid for what I consumed. Him and his family started talking about how inappropriate I was acting, I took my purse and went home afterwards cause there was so much commotion when they started arguing who's going to cover the bill.


His mom spam called me for hours, and he went off on me at home saying I spoiled his celebration and joy because I'm feeling bitter, especially considering I had enough money to cover the bill right there and then. I said this wasn't my obligation and he was the one who came up with the celebration idea. He argued that if the roles were reversed and I got a bonus, he'd celebrate me and my achievements and pay for the ""damn"" meals after taking me and my family out. I casually said ""well, that's just you not me"". He got even more pissed and said that he had had it with my juvenile antics and that he won't ever forget the scene I made at the restaurant infront of his family. Been upset with me for days now.

Update: Wow! too many responses here you guys and I'm seeing a variety of judgements! Just so you know my husband just got home and I'm going to show him these responses right now. I'll update with his opinion soon. Thanks.





Update: We just got into an argument. I showed him what I posted and he lost it on me, I accept my judgment but he won't, he said..and I quote ""these people have no idea"" and said that I should've mentioned that I make more money than him (not that much and I don't think it justifies it) and that he had paid the bill for me in the past when I forgot my wallet but I did pay him back so, He's pretty pissed right though he kept laughing sarcastically when reading some of the comments, he just walked out of the kitchen to take a phone call and said he'll be back. I'm still here with the dog waiting to see how this goes. I'll update if there's any new info.",20696,taxgu1,"NTA. You guys have separate finances, he didn't ask you beforehand.

AITA for telling my dad cheating is what got us here not my mom?,"My parents divorced when I was 7 after my mom found out dad had been cheating on her for five years with someone she considered to be her friend. The reveal of the affair came during my birthday party, which we celebrated late because dad made up some story about an old friend dying and going to the funeral when he was actually with her for an ultrasound after learning she was pregnant. My mom never ""got over"" what they did to her. I think what made it worse is two people betrayed her instead of one, because if our friends are willing to hurt us like this then we're screwed.

My dad married his affair partner. They have six children together now. My mom has stayed away from them as much as humanly possible. She told me a long time ago that she loved me, wanted me to be happy and loved and not to be distant from them for her, but that she would never be able to play happy families with my dad and his wife and their kids because some hurts are too deep and painful to move on from.

When stay in place was ordered things between my mom and dad deteriorated after my dad asked if mom would take his other six kids into her home, so ""the siblings could see each other"" since both he and his wife were frontline workers and had planned to send them somewhere to limit their exposure. Mom said hell no. She was pissed as hell at dad for asking while dad was pissed as hell that she didn't force me to go to his in-law's to spend time with my siblings while we weren't legally allowed to meet up with others.

Things are the same now. Only my mom suffered less financially through the pandemic. After a while my dad and his wife left their jobs when it got too much and their financial stability took a huge hit. My dad can't afford to throw a graduation party for me, which is fine. But he and his family are not welcome to the one my mom is hosting. He was bitching about them missing out on celebrating with me because of my mom. I told him it was because of his affair and not my mom. That he was the one who betrayed her over and over again, disrespected her and then expected her to act like none of that happened so he could act like the good guy.

He told me it had been a decade and my mom and I should be over it, and I should not have taken sides. I told him he should have kept the affair from me then instead of letting it come out for me to hear.

AITA?

ETA but another element of this story is that the affair first started after my mom almost died losing my sibling. The pregnancy went badly wrong and almost took her and did take her chance to have more children. All the while her husband and friend were getting together behind her back.",20687,uxczxv,"NTA.

"AITA for dropping my sisters kids off at a daycare, and making her pay for it?","My (19F) sister (25F) asked me to babysit for her (kids are 4&6)  so she could go a friends party. I told her I can't do that day, I had an exam so I *had* to be at college. (I can follow some classes online, and have occasionally babysat while listening to lectures). 

The day for which she needed a babysitter came. I answered the door in the morning and the *freaking kids were on my doorstep and my sister was driving off.* She just left them with me after I said I couldn't stay home that day! 

I called a friend that owns a small daycare, she told me I could drop them off there. Thank god. I gave her my sisters contact info to her and told me to keep me updated, and I texted my sister about what happened and gave her the address and the phone number. 

I picked the kids up from daycare since my sister wasn't answering her phone, and fed them. She picked them up at 9ish pm and was absolutely livid that I left them with a stranger, that it was irresponsible, that something could have happened, etc. I told her that she knew I couldn't babysit that day, and that she could have picked them up if she wasn't comfortable with that since I texted the address. She told me I should have just skipped the exam to retake it later. 

I thought this was a reasonable thing to do, when someone leaves kids on your doorstep without warning and you can't take care of them, but my parents are on her side. My mom told me my sister already has so much on her plate, and that I should help out when I can. I guess babysitting at least one day a week for free isn't good enough. 

AITA?

Edit: She and her friends went to an escape room or something, it wasn't a regular party. My parents weren't home that day to babysit. And you *can* retake exams here, but it's a hassle and it means that if I fail I can't retake it. Just to clear some things up.

UPDATE: AITA For not allowing my family to see my daughter until after they explain why she wet herself?,"Hey yall! First of all, just want to say how grateful I am for all the comments I recieved, and was unable to reply to. I appreciate it.

First things first; my daughter is okay now. She's talking some, although not much. She's back to using her communication device, though. 

She had play therapy on Monday in which some things she acted out were minorly concerning. I apologise for not going into detail, family have found my acc and I'm trying to protect her privacy. She started talking again that day, too. 

There was immediate concern between myself and her therapist, which was then conveyed to her second therapist, who she sees on Thursdays. 

I am happy to say we have answers, however. On Wednesday my dad called me. He's been feeling guilty and was desperately trying to figure out what happened. He eventually convinced my mom to get it out of my sister. 

At which point my sister confirmed what most of you guessed - my girl asked for a chocco pop, got told no in a yell bc my sister was frustrated with food. Kiddo got scared and then realised she had to go to the toilet, but at this point was non verbal. She tried to get my sisters attention, who assumed she was after the cake pop, and was yelled at again. 

The last part is a little messy, but one of the men then yelled at her again, effectively scaring her into wetting herself, at which point she started crying and her cousin went and found my dad for her. Everyone who was present basically agreed to not tell me the full truth so I didnt go mad on them. 

I was upset, and still havent opened contact with everyone. Although my dad did come see her yesterday and came to therapy with us, which I think helped. The therapy session essentially confirmed what had been said, and we're upping her to two therapy sessions with that therapist a week. We are still trying to gage if two play therapy sessions are needed too, or maybe just lengthening the existing one.

I still have not spoken to my sister because I do not believe I would be able to be civil. My dad and I are working to rule out family members that were definitely not involved to hopefully have her see them more, as that's something her therapist recommended. 

I hope this update is satisfactory? I was going to wait until we had it completely figured out, but that could take months, depending on how my daughter deals with things. 

Again, thank you all for your comments, advice and suggestions!

ETA for those who asked; I worked out how many people were there.

My dad, our mom, my sisters dad and his wife. And then her dads mom. Our mom has six kids, me and her included, my five siblings were there (but one is a kid himself).

Then my sister has two half sisters, a step sister and two step brothers. 

All of the siblings rounded up have partners who were present bar two. Which is twenty one adults. Then amongst everyone (my daughter and kid brother included) there was twenty nine kids.

Which, then, rounds the total count of people to fifty (fifty one if you count me). Which is a lot of people.

I think I got all the math right. Anywho, its taking a while. Some of the kids are teens and we're trying to figure out of it was maybe one of the older boys that yelled at her, which is why they're still keeping that secret.",20666,sru3kj,The thing that makes me happiest about this update is reading that you have the support of your own father.

"AITA For giving my dog an ""offensive"" name and then refusing to change it?","I have several dogs, one of which is an American Akita. His name is Yankee. I thought it was funny, and he seems to like his name.

My sister was in the states the past two years and recently flew home with her boyfriend in tow. First time we've met him, yada yada.

I guess she never mentioned me or my dogs, but he was pretty surprised when I told him my dogs name. I didnt think much of it - most of my pets have peculiar names so I assumed it was just an overall reaction. 

They left, my partner and I had dinner. Part way through our food my sister called and asked if I'd consider changing my dogs name. I kind of thought she was kidding, but she reiterated that she was serious.

The name yankee had upset her boyfriend, quite badly, and he found it offensive. I basically told her to fuck off and tell him to grow up, before going back to my food.

The following day they literally show up at my door. I was kind of taken aback - apparently they came to tell me why the name yankee was so awful. 

During this discussion he told me it was essentially a slur used against Americans, and asked if I would ever name a dog the n word. I just kind of laughed and told him he was off his nut. Its not that serious. You cant equate the word yankee to something like the n-word.

I told him I wasnt going to change my dogs name - he knows it, it'd be a shit ton of work. He's personal protection so it could even damage his work. 

They, thankfully, left, but still seemed pretty upset. Thinkinh back now I'm pretty sure theres a company with yankee in the name? I wonder how many letters of complaint he's sent.

Anyway, I did message my American friends just to make sure I wasnt being a prick. They all agreed he was being stupid, but I know the US is huge and it might be more of a regional thing? So I'm still not sure. I am starting to feel kind of asshole-ish for not taking him seriously when it may be a genuine issue for him.

So, I come to reddit. Two birds, one stone, I know a large amount of Americans frequent this subreddit. Am I am asshole, and is this an issue in the states that I should apologise for?

ETA: I had a shower at 70 comments and now we're nearly at a thousand? I cant keep up with them I'm sorry 😭

Anyway, I think he's from the south, and my sisters a tory so he's more than likely a republican. 

Eta from my partner; Since this post is gaining traction I want to play a game. We are currently trying for a baby - what are some potential baby names we could mention to him?

AITA for yelling at my husband's mother for announcing my pregnancy using my husband's facebook account?,"
I f23 found out that I was pregnant very recently, It was not planned and my husband and I are trying to make a decision regarding going through with the pregnancy.


Here's the thing, I told him to not tell anyone but he ended up telling his mom but made her swear that she won't tell. he didn't tell her we aren't sure about it but just to stay quiet. Well, She begged and begged that she announce it on her facebook under the guise of using our permission but I said absolutely not and lied and said my husband and I wanted to announce it ourselves later if we decide to go through with it.


just a day ago I found out she logged into my husband's facebook account and dropped the bomb (made the announcement and yes she pretended to be my husband!) behind our back. I was floored I called her and she said she figured if she made the announcement using one of our social media accounts then we won't mind and it'd still look like we made the announcement. But like I stated earlier, we're still trying to make a decision. I lost my temper and yelled at her which made her cry. I said she overstepped and messed up completely then hung up.


My husband came into the room yelling about my poor treatment and abuse towards his mom. I told him his mom violated our privacy and put us in more pressure to finally make a decision for the baby since the family are now calling to say ""congratulations"", He said that it was his fb so none of my privacy was ""violated""and that I shouldn't have yelled and hurt her feelings and made her cry no matter what, period. he demanded I apologize and we'll talk about the pregnancy later but I didn't give an answer and refused when he tried to force me to go to her house and ""grovel"" with apologies.

AITA for using my husband's car to get to work after he tricked me into going to his family's BBQ party?,"

I (f33) am a nurse, I have a very very busy schedule. It's been absolutely crazy the past couple of years. My husband (m36) works an office job and because he's a family-oriented type of guy, he always hangs put with his family. His family live on a ranch in the middle of literally nowhere. It's a hassle to go there and due to my work nature, I don't go to most of their functions, I do however make sure to attend the big ones.


Last week, his family wanted to host a BBQ party. He wanted me to go with him so badly since all his brothers were bringing their wifes and since they mocked him for coming alone in the past. I said sorry but I had a shift to cover. He begged, suggested I swap shifts with other nurses who are my friends and even called them all to beg them to cover for me. I grew irritated and told him to stop it. He sulked for a whole day then dropped it.

In the morning, and hours before my shift I discovered that my car's tires were out of air. My husband offered to drive me to the hospital at 4pm and I agreed. I got ready and we got in the car but instead of taking me to the hospital, he drove me straight to his family's ranch. I was dumbfounded and angry after he said he tricked me into attending this BBQ and that I had to suck it up and set this shift out. I was so mad I didn't know what to say.


We got to the ranch and I sat outside fuming. I waited and saw I still had time to make it to the hospital if I figured out a way to get there. I watched my husband go inside leaving his Keychain next to me (right where he was sitting) I took it and rushed to the back where all cars were parked, got into the car and drove off. His dad saw me and told him. He started calling my phone relentlessly til I turned it off. I got to the hospital in time but didn't dare turn my phone on til it was past 8 pm. I opened it and saw tons of angry messages from him berating me calling me horrible and a manipulator. I got on the phone with him and he yelled about the awful stunt I pulled and bailing from the party and making him look bad infront of his family. He then calmed down and said that he now knows that work is more important to me and that he won't ever trust me afteri basically stole his car and ran with it.

AITA for not saying anything when someone called me spoiled and privileged?,"My husband's best friend ""Nate"" got a new girlfriend ""Camilla"" about half a year ago. She moved to our city recently so she doesn't really have any friends here, but she and I hanged out a couple of times and started to get friendly. 

For context: we are all in our twenties, my husband and I both have nice jobs, we own a small flat, play tennis as a hobby (Camilla thinks it a rich people sport) and we regularly travel by finding 10€ plane tickets and staying at cheap hostels for ~3 nights at a time. 

Now to the point: my husband and I were hosting a little get together. Nate, Camilla and a few of our other friends were invited. At one point, the conversation went to topics like the current level of inflation, how the lockdown effected people and jobs, the housing market, etc and I had something to say too, agreeing with Camilla. 

Camilla cut me off and said something like ""Haha, no offense, but you are way too much of a spoiled privileged girl to understand things like this. You would need a tragedy or two in your life to understand struggle. I love you, but you never experienced any hardship in your life, haha."" 

The room went dead silent and nobody said anything. After some awkward silence, I stood up and said: ""Well, is anybody hungry? Shall we eat?"" and we never went back to that topic. 

Camilla messaged me the next day asking me how could I do this to her. Nate told her afterwards that I had an abusive father and I fell ill as a teenager, spent months in the hospital, had to have multiple life saving surgeries and it took me a month to learn to walk again. Camilla is mad at me for not telling these very personal things to her before and making her look terrible to Nate's friends. She said that even correcting her at the party would have been better, because then she could've apologized to me in front of everyone, but I took that chance away from her and now she will never make friends here. 

Honestly, this whole thing is ridiculous and I don't really think I'm an asshole, but it never hurts to ask. Maybe I should have gently corrected her after she said that. AITA?",20453,utnzk1,"NTA.
Camilla could have avoided all of that by just keeping quiet. She didn't need to weigh in an ignorant opinion like that, and it certainly wasn't going to help her 'make friends' even if it was true. What she said was rude and uncalled for.

AITA for serving fake meat and pretending it was real?,"My two daughters are vegetarian but my husband and son are not. I'm probably what they would call a ""flexitarian"". 

My son and husband always turn up their noses at tofu or any other meat alternatives - they say it's just ""weird"" that it's made to resemble real meat, so it's really the concept and not the taste. There are no allergies. My family and I often make two versions of dinner - one meat, one real, and twice the amount of pots and pans. There is an equal distribution of cleaning and cooking in this house, thankfully.

My daughters had a fun prank idea of making two pots of spaghetti sauce, under the pretense that one was meat (they were both the soy ground beef). The goal here was to see if their brother and father actually hated the meat and to see if we could maybe save some dishes and time (in the future).

Everyone loved dinner, both husband and son finished their plates. This was when my youngest couldn't hold it in anymore and told them. They both got VERY upset about being fed something other than what they were told.

AITA for canceling the AirBnB and leaving SIL basically stranded after she brought her dog?,"I booked an AirBnB retreat for me, my husband, my SIL and her husband about 4 months ago. The AirBnB was not dog friendly and I made that perfectly clear, as my SIL thinks her dog should be welcomed everywhere, no matter the cost. She said she would find a dog sitter and I had no reason to question it. 

The AirBnB was out of state, about 15 hours away on a really nice beach in Tampa. My husband and I flew down and my SIL insisted on driving so she left roughly 24 hours prior to our flight. She said it was cheaper to drive than it was to fly. When my husband and I arrived my SIL and her husband were already sitting in the driveway. When they saw me pull in she had asked if we got the keys yet, which we had because we met up with the owner along the way and she said ""oh good, give them to me quick so I can get Brute instead without being seen"". I just stopped dead in my tracks and was like ""Are you fucking kidding me right now?"" She kept saying things like ""What? I couldnt find anyone to watch him."" Or ""He is fucking old and house broken. I dont know why anyone would be ignorant enough to say no pets allowed."" And basically just kept making excuses as to why she was in the right. My husband is just sitting there completely dumbfounded and shaking his head. I just got back in my rental car and left. I got a refund from AirBnB and dropped the keys off with the woman and explained the situation. She told me I could still stay there because I've been honest but I told her no, the place was too big for just my husband and myself. We end up staying at a significantly less expensive hotel (I paid almost $4k for the week for the AirBnB but only spent $1800 for the week at the hotel). 

During this whole time my SIL is blowing us up saying she cant afford to stay down here (my husband and I make a lot more than SIL and her husband so we had agreed to pay for everything) and says she didnt bring anything with her to snack on and couldnt afford prices of shit here and whatever. I just straight up ignored her because in my eyes, she tried ruining my trip that I 100% paid for. My MIL is down our throats saying the least we could have done was give them some money for food instead of leaving them stranded and I told her ""Nope, they can just drive back home and get food there."" AITA?",20443,vy67oz,NTA - She ruined her own plans by refusing to follow explicit rules that she clearly knew she was violating.

AITA for telling my wife that leaving her used pad in my brother's place was inappropriate?,"


My wife and I were invited to my brother's 31st birthday. He's single and lives alone in his apartment.

So to give you the headsup, my wife and him don't get along so well. But can be civil enough to sit at the same table.


So, we went and had dinner and talked and everything was going well, no argument nothing til after my wife went to use the bathroom. Later my brother went to use the bathroom then came back looking pissed. He kept giving me and my wife looks but I didn't know what was going on til he pulled me aside before we left and told me that my wife had left her used pad in his bathroom. I was shocked and didn't know what to say because this felt highly inappropriate. He said he didn't appreciate what my wife did and that it was a sign of disrespect towards him. I apologized profoundly and said I didn't know about it. He asked me to speak to her or she wouldn't be welcome in his place anymore.


We got in the car and I asked my wife about it, she nonchantly said there was nothing wrong with what she did and that my brother was being ridiculous. I kind of flipped and told her it was very inappropriate for her to leave her used pad in his place even if it was in the bathroom and in the trashcan because it made him uncomfortable. She yelled asking what she was supoosed to do and I told her she could've took it with her and threw it outside not in his bathroom -- that's my brother's place and he told me how he felt about it. She yelled at me calling my brother an incel and me an asshole for ""getting in her face about it"". She said she needed to use the bathroom and it's not like the pad was vidible since she dumped it in the trashcan.


At home we still argued about it and she kept on calling me and my brother names. She's currently not speaking to me and is avoiding me entirely. Regardless, I feel like it's his place and he gets to express what makes him uncomfortable in it.


EDIT. I can't give info or expand on what was seen but I can tell you that the trash can does not have a lid. It's not like one of those trashcans that have a lid on top and you can push it. What I want to emphasize on is the fact that as guests we should respect people's homes and not argue about what makes them uncomfortable. He said it made him uncomfortable and that should, in my opinion, be acknowledged.",20411,ymt09m,[deleted],2157,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ymt09m/aita_for_telling_my_wife_that_leaving_her_used/
AITA for changing all the locks in my house without letting my mom know?,"When I (23M) was 15 my dad died, My mom (45) didn't wait too long to ""start over"" and moved her new partner in just 2 months later.

My dad left everything to me and not even a dime to her (they were not married), My dad's will was so structured that she couldn't challenge it, and she attempted and even ask me to pass over one of my properties to her to show my ""new"" dad that he was welcomed, I couldn't even if I wanted to, because my dad's will was specified that I must be 21 to have access to everything he left me.

This dude had kids (18M, 19F their ages now) and my mom prioritized them to keep him happy, I mean she wasn't like ab\*sive or neglectful but she tended to favor them, they went on trips, and even if she didn't tell me not to go she'd say something between the lines as: ""Wouldn't you like to go to your grandparents (My dad's) better?"" I mean I'm not stupid and I know she didn't want me there.

When I turned 17 she asked me to leave (My own house) because I kept fighting with her dude and I also reminded him of whose house it was, when he wanted to play the man of the house, I also called him John Conroy.

My Grandparents told me to avoid confrontation so I went to live with them, my mom would visit me often and tell me how much she loved but she needed to ""keep peace at home""

After college, I decided to check my properties and also the one that my mom is living at, I wanted to renovate it to rent it since it's a good one and can help me to afford my master's, I went there to inform my mom but no one was there (Later I found out they went on vacations) I called her but she didn't answer so I proceeded to change the locks (mainly to officially take possession) they arrived yesterday and could get in, of course, they called me but I wasn't on the town, I went to day because some renovation works will start in few weeks, I was in the back yard and my mom came in furious yelling at me saying how I dare to do that, So we talked and I let them know they have two weeks to leave, her husband (an unemployed oh sorry, self-employed) was furious, my mom and her stepdaughter started crying because the girl is pregnant (I'm sorry) but I made up my mind.

My mom's family is shaming me but I'd like to know if you think I'm TA?

My mom called me today saying we can talk.

edit: I'm not in the USA.

Not really looking for legal advice.

Guys, Life out of the USA exists, there other 194 countries in the world. ",20385,v55p0f,"Ok, just talked to my lawyer.

1. There is nothing ilegal about changing the locks (Something I alredy knew since, I did it becuase he told me I could) 
2. The law establishes two ways to get someone out of your property 

2.1 By force (yeah the law says you can take someone out by force)

2.2 By sueing them 

Scenario one: I kick them out by force (Usually by changing locks) they can sue me back, and the judge would probably grant them 2 months to fine a new place or just give them an order to take their things out (usually 3 days) (If they allege I'm not letting them take their things out)

Scenario Two: I sue them to leave my property, The judge woud probably command me to let them have 1-2 months to move out 

In any scenario, they won't be longer than 2 months. 

What he sugested is that we have an arrengement between us (mom and I) which is what usually happens in these cases, We could agree 1 month/ 1 week to let her pack her thing. If she refuses to leave after the time we agree, I just lock the house and she'll be given 3 days to take everything out.",358,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v55p0f/aita_for_changing_all_the_locks_in_my_house/
"AITA for telling my husband's female friend ""He might be your best friend but you're not his""?","Long story short my husband has one of those female friends, I'll call her Sarah. Her and I get along fine, but every once in awhile she'll make a comment or sit a little too close or touch him a lot, or compete with me on how close the are, or how well she knows him. She's one in a big group of about 11 friends. I've talked to my husband about her several times but it's so many added up micro-actions that it's hard to tell her off for one singular thing, without looking crazy. 

Well this past weekend, the group of friends got together for the first time since we're now all boosted.  My husband and I eloped a few weeks ago and this was the first time most were seeing us since. Sarah came right up and got in our face as the group was congratulating us to tell my husband how disappointed she was in him for not telling her about our ceremony, not inviting her, not even sending her a photo. He told her nobody except our parents knew, nobody was invited, and we don't have our professional photos back. This girl started SOBBING. How could he do this to her, that she wanted him to be her Man of Honor when she gets married (she's single), and he didn't even invite her to his, and their friendship now ""needed some serious TLC to recover"". This is in front of a whole group. I couldn't take it anymore and said ""He might be your best friend, but you're not his, and this was between ME and HIM, you were not even a consideration.""

There were so frosty ""ooo's"" from the crowd and she left the house. The crowd is split. They were all my husband's friends before I came into the picture and some think it was uncalled for and that I should've just let my husband handle it. I was mad in the moment but now I don't know. Too far?

AITA-For ignoring my boss and blocking his number on my vacation,"My boyfriend (29 m) and I (26 f) are currently long-distance. We take turns visiting each other. He came to see me after almost two months of not seeing each other. We finally were to make plans. I requested to have five days off which was approved from my job. I’ve worked there for six years. I’m a security guard at a department store. 

It was after my shift, and I was heading out quickly. I had to pick my bf up from the airport. I clocked out, and while I was saying bye to everyone. My new boss of 2 weeks stopped me, and he asked if I could cover a shift. Since one of my co-workers called in sick. We’re short-staffed, and he needs me to stay for a couple hours more. I had a 10-hour shift. I was exhausted. 

I responded no. I’m sorry, but I’m unable to do that, and I can’t stay late. I have covered shifts before in the past. I don’t mind, but I had somewhere to be. I mentioned I was picking up someone at the airport. He told me they could take an Uber. My boyfriend wouldn’t be happy with me if I did to him. Also he has no key to my apartment. 

No one else wanted to stay, and I was the third person he asked to that said no. I said sorry, I can’t just tonight, another time. 

He called me a lousy worker, and I’m not a team player. I said, guess I’m not a team player and I walked passed him. I called out. I’ll see him in five days. While driving to the airport, I kept getting calls and texts from him; it got so bad that I had to pull over to turn off my phone. My boss wanted me to come back to work. 

I had to turn on my phone, so my boyfriend could contact me. My phone was flooded with text messages. Ding after ding I think I got close to 15 texts. I blocked his number. 

I was so happy to see my bf. I was getting emails from my boss constantly when I was supposed to be my time off. I didn’t respond to and I rarely take vacation. One, he was asking me stuff that I didn’t know the answer to. Second, even if I did, I’m not telling him. I don’t know; I was starting to get petty. 

I still had fun with my boyfriend. When I went to work, my boss called me into his office. He blew up at me for being unprofessional, and he’s still new to this job. I should’ve helped or at least replied to the emails. I responded other people could’ve helped him. It’s not my responsibility when it’s my vacation time. I got my first write-up ever.  

Is this something I’m missing? Did I do something inherently wrong here? I’m actually considering to report him. He is still new to his job. Am I the asshole?

Edit: I’m Canadian.  I live in BC. 

Update: I just sent an email to my HR with all the emails texts call logs. And any other evidence I have. My job isn’t like on call.So I don’t understand why he was bothering me he is my age roughly. On a happier note me and my boyfriend are planning to move in together

Edit 

I’m a security guard at a departmental store. I like my job. HR Is setting a meeting up for tomorrow with me and my boss.  My boss Tried asking me out in his first week of working But I told him down (nicely).

Edit

Thank you for everyone’s support. When I posted this I thought I was
 being a little dramatic. I’m glad I’m not the crazy one. I decided that I’m gonna look for a new job. I still wanna do security work but I’m just gonna move on. Don’t worry I’m still going to complain about my boss And report him.

Final update.

AITA for 'emasculating' my husband and refusing to make my parents apologise for it?,"Me (28f) and my husband (29m) have been married for 5 years. My husband was a nurse until he told me he wanted to become a doctor. I was fully supportive and he is now in his first year of medial school. I have been supporting the both of us as he cannot work while in school, but recently found out our rent was being raised by $500 at the end of our contract (April). This was honestly the last straw as it pushed us past where we were financially comfortable, so I raised the idea of us buying a home. 

This had been a conversation for years, but my husband had always said we could after he had paid off his school debt from nursing (paid off early 2020). I asked my mother (real estate agent) who told me that with what we'd be paying, it would be better for that money to go towards mortgage repayments and not rent. I brought this all up to my husband who shut it down almost immediately. He told me our agreement was to wait until he had paid off all his debt. I told him that was for nursing and that he was in school for 6 years, which was hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of debt and some doctors don't pay off their debt for 20+ years. I told him I had been supportive of this career change and by financially supporting the household, but that it was the best financial decision for us but also relieved the financial burden for me. I brought up the savings we had for our deposit and how we could afford something small and modest within budget, but he told me it was in our interest to use that money to pay off his loans. I asked him if he realised the financial burden this would put on me, but he said it was temporary and eventually he'd make more than me so it would be even and I'd agreed to this.

My mother called and asked if we were going to look into buying a house, but I told her we weren't and we'd be looking for somewhere cheaper to rent instead. She insisted we at least consider it because it made the most financial sense, and asked if it was because we didn't have a down-deposit. I told her that we were probably going to use that to pay off my husbands debt and he didn't want more debt until he was debt free from student loans. Days later, my mother and father came for lunch and told us they had news. They offered to gift us the down-deposit of a home. I was over the moon and shocked by the offer. Once they left, my husband exploded on me, claiming I emasculated him and made him look bad in front of my parents. I told him I never asked for this but we should take it as it was a privilege most people don't get and would relieve so much financial burden on me. He refuses to talk to me or my parents until we apologise for shaming/emasculating him but I refused too. I apologised but told him I wouldn't make my parents as they'd done nothing wrong.

AITA for telling my husband to stop disrespecting our surrogate?,"
Me (f34), my husband Hunter (m37) suffered from fertility problems, we recently decided to get a surrogate who's a friend of a friend. We were busy getting everything done legally, we already had a contract in place. My egg was used so no worries in this regard, plus our surrogate is a respectful, kind woman who's been keeping her part of the contract in tact, but it's Hunter who's starting to act strange, I've noticed that he's been focusing his all attention on our surrogate like skipping work to visit her or get her things she didn't ask for, chat with her all the time on social media and also constantly offering to do things for her like .... drive her places and sometimes even invite her out or offer to repair stuff for her. She complained to me about this and even told me about things he's been doing that I didn't even know about, like bringing her gifts. I tried speaking to him about what this looks like but he said that he's doing what he's doing for his son and not her, still I asked that he tone it down and respect the woman's space. He got mad at me and accused me of being jealous of the woman who's carrying my own child and said that this makes me look bad. I said our surrogate was the one who complained about his behavior and he said that this wasn't true. Apparently this made him somewhat angry so I gave him time to cool down a bit.

Yesterday, our surrogate called me saying that Hunter came over and told her guests to leave, I asked why and she said that he wanted to show her the 9k car he bought for her. I was shocked, she said she declined the car and asked him to leave but he started arguing with her about using public transportation and risking our baby's wellbeing. I was fuming I called him demanding he get home and he did eventually. Once he got back I picked up a fight with him and yelled at him saying that he's been nothing but overstepping, disrespectful, and inappropriate towards our surrogate, again he explained the car wasn't for her but to ensure that the baby is safe. I told him to stop disrespecting the woman and stop using the baby as an excuse to stomp all over her boundaries. He ranted about how he was just trying to make this work and that I should do the same if not more, he even accused me of not loving our son as much he does but this isn't the way and putting 9k for car without telling me? He left the house for a while then came back and refused to speak to me.

I might've been hard on him, he might've just been oblivious so I'm less sure seeing his reaction now.",20307,tjb2po,"NTA. He’s actually endangering the successful arrival of your son because he’s not only causing stress to your surrogate, he’s also making her so uncomfortable that she might seek legal recourse to break the contact.

AITA for not inviting one child from my daughters class to a party?,"My (28 female) and husband (29 male) have a daughter Payton (7 female). 

Payton goes to a small school with 20 kids in her grade. Her birthday party is next month and we sent out invitations to her friends at school. We invited the whole class except one student. 

The student we did not invite has bullied Payton several times (we’ve had meetings with the school and parents). Obviously Payton doesn’t want this kid at her party. 

The other girls mother called me to talk about it saying how now her daughter is crying she was the only kid not invited and everyone at school is talking about the party. (Payton’s parties are known by her classmates to be very over the top). I explained her daughter isn’t nice to my daughter and that’s the reason she wasn’t invited (the mother knows this). The mother said I’m teaching my child to be a “bully” and use her wealth to make friends. I disagreed. 

The mother then asked if she had her daughter apology and write Payton a letter we could reconsider. I told her we would not and it has become a big deal every time I see the mom. 

AITA?

Edit for questions:

Invitations were not handed out in the classroom. I handed them to parents directly.

I’ve seen a few people ask exactly what kind of bullying has occurred. So I’ll give a couple examples from last year and this year. 
- one time Payton came home crying because the little girl was so mean to her. Telling her she wasn’t pretty, too chubby, etc. 
- Payton has come home crying several times because the girl has told her there’s no way she’s a cheerleader (Payton does cheering on weekends) because she wasn’t “pretty”. 
- she has told Payton she couldn’t play with the rest of the girls in the class when they were all playing jump rope at recess. The other girls told her to let Payton play so when it was Payton’s turn the girl purposely got her “out” by not swinging the rope nicely. The teacher saw that happen. 
- she’s called Payton a cry baby. 

And this is only a couple of the incidents that happened.


Update: 

Payton’s party was today. She had so much fun. The student that was not invited did show up but did not make it past the community gate. In our neighborhood you have to have someone at the gate in order for people to enter. 

We had face painting, balloon animals, a bounce house, an obstacle course, a magic show, and character appearances. We even had a life size Barbie box for pictures and pink everything. There was activities for the kids to do and everything was a hit. Also thank you to the commenter who suggested swag bags. We did have them and the kids loved it!",20282,y27o37,"NTA.

AITA for using my son's savings to get his stepbrother's car fixed?,"

My stepson (19) got a new car from his bio mom. she and her family are well off and unlike me, they could afford to buy a car. I'm happy for my stepson but my son (17) isn't. in fact he complains about how unfair it is for my husband to let his ex gift their son a car but not him. It's unreasonable I know! but teenage years are mostly hard and it's even harder to expect the kids to be reasonable.

My son wanted to take part in driving the car as a ""compromise"" or else we would have to get rid of it. I sat him down to explain to him that the car is his stepbrother's property, and he shouldn't be expecting to drive it unless he's given permission. He was having non of it and kept giving us ultimatums saying he either share the car with his stepbrother or the car goes. When my husband confronted him, my son went and done so much damage to the car, he threw paint on it, ruined the lights and damaged the front of it completely. My stepson had a breakdown when he saw it in the morning and husband was beyond livid after seeing the fottages from our driveway cam and seeing my son damaging the car.

My husband confronted my son later and all my son did was laugh and give him the middle finger. I went to take all of his camp savings for this summer to pay for the damages and gave them to my husband. My son found out and went batshit on everyone in the house. He accused me of stealing then trying to please my husband for ""sex"" then told his stepbrother that he warned him and so he shouldn't be blamed. He also said it was my fault for not getting him a car or getting my husband to get him a car in the first place to avoid favoritism and conflict.

At his age, he should be able to comprehend that his stepbrother has a separate parent who he has no connection to and who can and will provide for her son.  And sometimes this includes gifts.

Your son should be grateful that his stepbrother didn’t involve the police.  What he did is a felony in many jurisdictions.  And at 17, it’s very likely he would be treated as an adult.",8058,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/umvcqg/aita_for_using_my_sons_savings_to_get_his/
AITA for leaving my sister and her husband on the side of the road?,"I come from a very “sex-positive” household. My parents taught my sister and I about sex, sexuality, and their “non-vanilla” lifestyle from a young age. They were very affectionate and touchy with each other in public and didn’t (and still don’t) seem to care about others opinions. They lived a very… non-conventional lifestyle and weren’t afraid to flaunt it. 

On one hand, my parents never treated sex as a shameful subject, therefore, I received a very comprehensive, inclusive, form of sex education. On the other hand, I think I was introduced to many topics at a very young age.

In many ways, my sister, “Angie,” turned out like my parents. She proclaims that she’s “sex-positive,” and has no qualms with openly discussing sex in great detail at every opportunity. She believes that if a person is uncomfortable, they must be a “conservative virgin/prude who clearly hates all forms of self-expression.” (her words). 

My wife, “Zara,” isn’t a huge fan of PDA. Other than hand-holding or occasional kisses on the cheek, she isn’t comfortable with doing much in public. We’re also not the type of people to discuss our sex-life with people, much less family.

Angie doesn’t like Zara. She believes that Zara is too “conservative/prudish” for our family. She often makes fun of Zara for “looking embarrassed,” when she’s discussing, in excruciating detail, about sex. Zara barely says anything, but Angie still manages to make fun of her.

I don’t speak to Angie much.

Recently, Zara’s brother passed away. Angie’s husband, “Bill,” knew his partner and wanted to pass on his condolences. Zara, Angie, Bill, and I all wanted to attend his wake. Instead of taking separate cars, Angie suggested that we all go together. 

To be honest, I was not a huge fan of this idea. It was a two hour drive from where we live to our destination. Also, we were planning on leaving very early so that we could help set up and were planning to leave late. We still managed to do it. 

At first, everything was alright. Understandably, no one was speaking in the car and it was very quiet in the car. Most people were keeping to themselves or sleeping.

Midway through the drive, Angie and Bill start making out in the backseat of our car. When I say “making out,” I mean, full-on, making out. They were pushing up against the car door and making all sorts of noises. Zara and I were extremely uncomfortable. 

I pulled over and started yelling at Angie. I told them that I was disgusted by their behaviour and that they were acting like horny little teenagers. Angie said that they were grieving. 

I yelled at them to get out of my car. At first, they were protesting, but I was so angry and so tired of them already. I told them to find their way home by themselves.

My parents think that I went too far with them and that Zara needs to “loosen up,” in order to be a part of this family. Obviously, Angie and Bill are still extremely pissed.

EDIT: When I initially pulled over, I pulled over into a small petrol station that had a little cafe. Saying, “side of the road,” was a poor choice of words and I apologise for all the confusion.",20251,xzpkj5,"NTA—anyone who is sex positive knows about consent and if she’s not getting consent to involve you in her exhibitionism then she’s being a sex-negative and gets to walk home.

AITA for exposing my cousin’s creepy husband to my entire family?,"I (22f) met my cousin’s husband (24f and 26m) last July for their wedding. They live several states away so in addition to meeting him for the first time it was also the first time I had seen my cousin in a few years. I instantly got a bad vibe from him and he made several comments that rubbed me the wrong way. He told me I seemed like a “wild child” and said he would bet I’m a “bad girl” at my college. Since meeting him he has followed me on Instagram and sporadically sends me reels (which I don’t open) and comments odd things on my posts like “looking good cousin 👍”. He even DM’d me once “hey I’ll be in your state this weekend on business…lol” which I never opened either. All of this definitely creeped me out but I didn’t feel like I could say anything about it because my cousin and I aren’t close and I’ve always felt like she looks down on me because she is a devout Christian and I am not. 

Fast forward to this week, one of those fake accounts on Instagram popped up with some of my pictures asking for money for X-rated pictures. The bio was in broken English, the pictures were poorly cropped screenshots of my two most recent posts, and the cashapp was random string of numbers and letters. The account just looked very fake and many of my friends sent it to me and and reported the account. Of course, the 1 person who apparently fell for it was my cousin’s husband. I then got a very long, nasty DM from my cousin telling me she had been very tolerant of my sinful lifestyle (whatever that means) but this time I had gone too far. She said she didn’t care that we were family and so long as I was posing a threat to her marriage I was no longer welcome in their lives. I calmly and politely responded that this account was not me and that I had already reported the account to Instagram to be taken down and I apologized for the apparent disruption to her day. She responded that she didn’t believe me and said she pities me for having such low self esteem and would keep me in her prayers. 

I lost it at this point. I called her stupid for falling for an account that was so obviously fake and said that her husband was such a blatant creep it was embarrassing she even married him. I sent screenshots of the months of DM’s from him that I never responded to and concluded by saying “if your marriage is so easily threatened, get a divorce. Don’t take your insecurities out on me.”

Shortly after I got angry phone calls from my mom and my grandma saying my cousin made an honest mistake and that my response was cruel and unjustified. Apparently my cousin showed everyone our messages and is humiliated by what I said. My mom is worried our relationship with that side of the family is permanently damaged, and now I may not be welcome at future family gatherings because my grandmama “doesn’t want the drama.” I really don’t feel like my response was out of line, but since no one else agrees with me I’m not sure. So, AITA?",20256,w5g6jv,"NTA

AITA for telling my dad the real reason why I don’t want to go on vacation with him/his family and potentially “ruining his marriage?,"I am a 17-year-old male, when I was around nine my dad (39M) started seeing a friend of my mom’s (Cheated on my mom) they married, and they now have three kids together.

My dad asked for custody and he was granted to have me on weekends, he seemed happy to have me and always tried to include me in everything but it was kind of weird and frustrating, he even tried to make me call his wife ""mom"" and went for full custody several times, since being with his wife and making me accept his new family was more important than spending actual time with me alone I stopped going to his house when I was 14 he tried to fight for full custody after my mom started dating my stepdad (a nice guy) but I told him to stop.

The other reason why I stopped going (I never told my dad this one) is because his wife was so hostile towards me, my dad used to pay attention to me when I was there so I think she didn’t like it that way and one day told me behind my dad’s back that I was an obstacle to my dad’s happiness that I should just stay with my mom full time.

Their anniversary was 5 days ago, I didn’t want to go but he called my mom to threaten that if I didn’t go, He’d go to court.

He took his four kids (including me), his wife, his parents, and his parents-in-law to celebrate at a nice restaurant. Once there he said that he had 6 tickets for vacations, I didn’t say anything but then he looked at me and said one is for you, I said “Thanks, but I’m not going”

He seemed angry and said ""ok I had enough, why don’t you want to go”, “just because,” I said but then he asked the same questions five more times so the sixth time I said: “Because I hate your wife” then he started asking “why” over and over again so I ended up telling him the mean things she said to me, He was seemingly uncomfortable but told us to finish our meal, no one talked for the rest of the night and after we finished I asked my stepdad to pick me up.

I haven’t spoken to my dad since, he just sent me a message asking if I changed my mind about the trip but I said no.

My cousin told me that my dad is staying at my grandparents’ now.

His wife texted me yesterday calling me a brat and asking if I was happy for potentially destroying my half-sibling's home life. But I just ignored her.

My cousin says that the kids are hurt and crying because my dad isn’t at home and she says that I should just have said other things or agree and then tell him later that I wasn’t going.

"AITA Boyfriend found my clean ""period panties"" and made me feel crappy about it","Hey all, my boyfriend is 27 and I'm 24. We've been together for almost two years. 

My boyfriend is EXTREMELY hygienic in all ways. Like showers twice a day, washes his clothes after every single wear, don't leave a single dish in the sink dirty. If you ask me, he's a little over the top on how clean he and everything around the house needs to be 24/7. He will scrub his body 3 separate times in one shower cycle just to make sure he doesn't miss any dirt. His showers are easily an hour most days if not more. I obviously have good basic hygiene skills, but I am much more relaxed. For example, I will wear a t-shirt twice before washing it so long as it's not stained, covered in something, or stinky. Or I might leave a few dishes in the sink for a few hours after dinner before I get up and wash them. He would prefer I didn't and just kept everything to a T right away. 

Yesterday night we were doing laundry. We always air-dry our clothes to save money and to reduce fading and shrinking. Usually I am the laundry person but on a one off he happened to be the one to take the clothes out of the washer and lay them out to dry. He came across one of my pairs of panties that I specifically only wear during that time of the month. I'm certain ladies will understand that we keep panties separate for periods than we do for when we aren't. Aka I have my ugly or maybe blood stained pairs for my period, and my cute and well kempt ones for when I'm not on my period. 

Anyways, upon seeing these, he told me that I need to throw that pair away and that it's disgusting and unhygienic. He made quite a few comments about how gross they are despite them being CLEAN but just blood stained from a previous period/spotting situation.  

I attempted to explain that i keep those pairs solely for when I am bleeding, and that it's a common thing girls do but quickly stopped because I could tell he just disagreed with me and told me that he's pretty sure other girls do not do this.

 It made me feel really... I don't know gross? Ugly? Alienated? I'm not really sure but it definitely made me upset and feel some type of way about something I felt was natural I guess. 

I snapped at him to forget my explanation because he's just making me feel like im gross. And a small argument insued because of this. We ended up going to bed kind of frustrsted with each other but i dont think im in the wrong. AITA?

*edit* to add that ""black panties"" don't exactly work for me because I have an iud and my period (and spotting) is very sporadic. I could go 3 months without a period, or I could have it two months in a row. I could have some random light spotting, or the full blown waterfall. There's really not consistency due to my iud. So I can't exactly ""plan out"" when to start wearing those specific black period panties.",20195,ye3rme,"NTA. Period panties are 100000% A Thing. If you keep them well washed, why waste money?

AITA for moving out while my parents are on vacation.,"I (F20) have three siblings who live at home. M22, M15, M12. My older brother does not work and does not go to school. My middle and youngest brothers are in Middle and High School. I have been taking care of them for about six years now. My parents both work. 

I am the only one who cleans, and makes food, and takes care of the dogs. I have access to a car that I share with my brother, but he takes it to go see his friends and hook up with tinder randos. So I have had to bring home groceries on the bus, because oh yeah I also do the grocery shopping. 

I have tried talking to my parents about it but they say that my brother is finding himself and the younger ones have to concentrate on school. I am in my third year of college and it is wrecking me. 

My boyfriend (24) has talked to his parents and they are letting me move into the apartment over their garage, he will be paying the rent for the apartment. He lives at home rent free but he also graduated and has a great job, so we talked about it and it is fair. We are committed to each other but we are way too young to think about moving in together or getting married. I am not saying that this is too young for anyone else. We just know what we want in life and until I get my nursing degree and get a job we aren't ready. 

My parents went away this weekend for NASCAR in Vegas. It is their third vacation this year. I do not begrudge them their holidays, they both work hard, but I am tired of being an unpaid nanny/dog sitter. 

So I grabbed my laptop, clothes, and a few other things that I have been gifted. I waited for my older brother to get home, And I left. I told him I was going out for milk but my boyfriend was waiting in the car around the corner. He started texting me about twenty minutes later saying he needed the car. I did not take the car. I left all the keys on the counter even my house keys. 

My grandparents pay for my education so there is literally nothing my parents can hold over me. I let him know I wasn't coming back and I let my parents know after the last race that I had left him in charge of the younger kids and bailed. 

They drove straight home instead of spending the night partying and driving home today. Everyone is mad at me for being so immature and thoughtless. I just don't care anymore. I talked to my grandfather and he says that I am right and my brothers can look after themselves. My mom keeps calling and complaining that the house is a mess, I was only gone for 9 hours before they got home but my brothers are pigs. 

My older brother says I am an asshole because my parents are making him do everything that I used to do. I cannot find it in myself to give a shit.

AITA for walking out of my baby shower after MIL denied me food?,"Before I start I'd like to say that I'm a bit of a big girl. No shame in that, I love myself just the way I am and I have been living by the motto ""be you, everybody else's taken"" 😅.

MIL (DH's mom) always made comments about my weight, eversince I got pregnant, she started making more comments while low key shaming me for what I eat.


Whenever I visit, she'd give me smaller plate, portion, cup even spoons. She also buys me ""small size"" clothes even though I'm in my 2nd trimester and those clothes don't fit.


My SIL decided to throw me a baby shower after my DH denied when my sister offered to throw me one. The whole side of my inlaws are invited. Mom refused to come after what DH said to my sister (another story for later).


I got there and MIL was in charge of serving food to the guests. All that was served was cakes and juice. I got hungry from talking and I got up to eat some cake. The second I put my hand on the cake. MIL grabbed my arm and said that I'd gained enough weight already and that if ""I keep this"" up her son will not be happy living with ""a large Walrus"". I was shocked I didn't know how to react especially since she said this out loud. She looked at me in a ""sorry-not-sorry"" kind of way. I put the cake down and grabbed my stuff and started walking. Her daughter stopped me saying I can't leave mid party and embarrass her like that. I told her to tell her mom to leave if she wanted me to stay but she went off and said ""Are you crazy? She's my mom! you want me to kick her out infront of everybody?"". I turned around and kept walking. I called mom to come pick me up and went home.


DH came home looking furious. He asked me to explain what I did at the baby shower and why. I mentioned what his mom did and he started ranting about how I fucked this up over something so minor. I told him it wasn't minor in my opinion since she literally cut me off food and didn't let me eat when I was hungry. He said that his mom meant well and that I needed to get rid of this ""easily offended"" mindset immedietly before I pass it down to our son. He said that cakes are essential foods, and that this was not a good enough reason to walk out the baby shower that his mom and sister put a ton of money, time and effort into. He said that I had hours to call and fix things up but I refused. I went to stay with my mom because he wouldn't stop pressuting me to call and apologize for what happened.

He kept talking about how pissed and let down his mom and sister feel and called me ungrateful and spiteful for doing what I did.


Am I overreacting here?


More info: Lot of of you asked what my DH said to my sister and what was the argument about.

The answer is, My sister is infertile. has been for years. DH claimed that she's becone ""obssessed"" with the baby simply just because she bought me stuff for the baby as gifts and wanted to throw me a baby shower. My sister is a great person and I have no doubt that she only did all that just because of how great she is/will be as an aunt. My DH kepts insisting there was ""something wrong"" with her which led to a fight between them and he ended up calling her ""possessive b&/$^"". My mom kicked him out and my sister cut contact with him.

AITA: For telling my husband to stop inviting his mom to our daughter's performances?,"Situation is pretty...fruatrating to say the least. But let's start with some context.


So, My husband and I have a 13 year/old daughter. She plays piano and has participated in several plays in and outside of school. Now here's the thing, my husband invites his mom to every performance our daughter has. not saying he shouldn't - BUT many times she'd put my daughter down and point out where she ""messed up"" and what she needed to work on (Hello? she's not even an expert in this). This happens every time! My daughter has picked up on these negative comments and her self esteem kept getting low and by extension, her performance kept getting low as well. I told my husband his mom needs to either stop putting our daughter down or stop coming to her plays. he said his mom is the grandmother and should be included in these events as ""support"".


Our daughter had a performance this past wednesday, I told my husband that his mom can sit this one out BUT he said it was too late because he sent her a link of the date and location of the event. I sighed and said nothing.


His mom arrived like - 20 minutes later, sat next to him and kept pulling him close while whispering in his ear. I just rolled my eyes, hard. Once the play was over and after we got a chance to see our daughter who looked nervous and shaking - mother in law looked at her and said ""let me just say that today's performance was disappointing"". my daughter was in shock and I was floored completely. My daughter started crying then rushed away. Mother in law then casually said ""oh I have to go now , I have an appointment with the salon for Chloe's (her other granddaughter) birthday party"". I was fuming I told her what she said to my daughter was not okay and that she made her upset. She said something along the line of ""just telling it how it is"" then left. We went home and I lost it on my husband telling him his mom just keeps putting our daughter down and it's not right!!! he said I'm being overdramatic and what his mom's doing is just constructive criticism. I told him from now on he needs to stop inviting her to our daughter's performances. He said I was being ridiculous and that I shouldn't expect his mom to be excluded from her granddaughter's life like that. we had a big argument and now my daughter isn't even interested in playing anymore, my husband said I was way out of line and shouldn't use our daughter in my fight with his mom. he also called me controlling and vicious.

AITA for calling off my wife's birthday party after she lied about bringing my daughter with her to the restaurant?,"
I'm prefacing this by saying that I (m38) have a daughter ""Sandy"" (f16) with an incredibly sensitive personality and loves to help people. We come from a well off background compared to her friends and so for the past few months, she has been doing some charity work. she's cut her hair and donated it to cancer patients, pawned her things and sold some of her expensive clothes/shoes and/or gave them away to help out her friends and other families. Now she wears thrift shop clothes which is something my wife isn't so happy with, she thinks that Sandy was/is painting a bad picture of us as neglectful parents and giving a false impression to people that were poor where in fact we're doing well financially. I admit my wife is all about appearances and recently I started noticing that she's been excluding Sandy from events/gatherings because of how she dresses.

I talked to her about it and she said it was all in my head. But last week was my wife's was birthday. We celebrated at a restaurant and I asked my wife to get Sandy and meet me there, although at first she hinted that if Sandy refuse to dress ""properly"" then she wouldn't bring her but I told her that if she didn't bring her then we'd have an issue and the party would be called off.

We waited and then I saw my wife walk into the restaurant by herself, I was mad I'm not gonna lie I asked her where sandy was and she told me she 'didn't feel like coming' even though she talked about how excited she was for this party. I just had this gut feeling that my wife was lying so I texted sandy and sure enough, my wife gave her an ultimatuim saying either she had to wear ""something that matches our class"" or she wouldn't be allowed to come to her birthday where her friends and family are gathered. I went and called Sandy outside and she was crying, I was furious I walked inside the restaurant and picked up an argument with my wife and told her family and friends exactly why Sandy wasn't there. My wife looked shocked, she started arguing with me and I ended up calling off the entire event and having everyone else leave early. My wife literally started yelling at me at the restaurant so I took my stuff and went home.


She got back and kept yelling at me for ruining her birthday and making a scene and humiliating infront of her friends and family, she said that Sandy was acting stubborn and that's on her but I told her she acted unreasonably by excluding her like that. Sandy was crying because of it and I felt like this too big to look over despite my wife saying that it wasn't a bug deal and ruined her birthday for no reason.


She went to stay with her family and won't even reply to my texts, she just reads them but don't respond. Probably expecting me to apologize for what happened.

Me [F34 and my fiance [M36 got engaged 2 months ago. I own the house we currently live in but after he moved in he started helping out with the mortgage payment. I have a daughter [Ruby, F12, she adores animals (she had about 7 pets so far in her life). Unfortunately, her dog Tic passed away. He was her closest friend and favorite pet. It was devastating for me as well because he was so precious.

As a way to honor him, I've printed a middle sized picture of him (Ruby's favorite) and put it in a frame and hanged the frame in the living room wall. Ruby was so happy with it especially since she gets to see him smiling at her when she walks in, It gives her comfort.

My fiance saw it and got upset. He commented on how strange it was to have the dog's picture up on the wall and how much of distraction it brings. I felt puzzled because we have all kinds of pictures that were hanging on that wall. He suggested we remove it but I ignored him. One day, I got home and saw that he's taken it down. Ruby was in her room crying holding the picture. I asked what happened and she told me that my fiance took the picture off and told her she's not allowed to have it hung up there, also told her to keep it in her room if she didn't want to lose it ""for good"". I was shocked. I rushed out and immediately started taking down all the certificates he had on that wall. His doctorate , master's and bachelor's degrees. And about 4-5 other certificates as well. All of them I took down and put in the bedroom. He discovered what I did and snapped at me and said that it's his house as well and I should respect his input. In my defense, I told him that since my daughter has to keep it in her room then he too has to keep his certificates in his room according to his logicHe yelled at me demanding that I stopped nagging him and acting childishly and spitefully. He wanted to put them back up but I refused and said that if he does that then Tic's picture will be put back up as well. He yelled about how I disrespected him and his achievements and treated them as trash, and then stormed out.

AITA for wanting my daughter to make my wedding cake although my future husband is refusing?,"
I (F-36) have a daughter (F-16) who loves baking, and she's incredibly good at it. It's her passion since she was 3 and I encourage her to follow it and discover more ways to become better at it. I even enrolled her in few classes in academy to learn more.


I met my fiance (M-41) 2 and a half years ago. We're getting married soon. And for the wedding cake I had an idea which's to have my daughter bake the cake and decorate it for us. My daughter agreed and was so excited to do it. My fiance glanced at me when he heard about it then when we were alone he snapped and said ""I can't believe you're being serious about this"" I told him why not, it's not like we're having a huge formal wedding with many guests. Just a small party with our family and loved ones. He said this was a ""fucking joke"" and that he will not let ""a child"" bake our wedding cake while there are tons of professional bakers out there who can make a much more decent looking/tasting one. I said I didn't understand the problem because I thought he loved her baking. He responded ""I do love what she bakes but let's just stick to the muffins and brownies"". I told him he was being unreasonable and that his words were hurtful to me and my daughter and her abilities. He told me to be more realistic and think about what the guests will say. again, I said all the guests are family and friends so I doubt they'd make any negative comments about the cake knowing my daughter made it. Matter of a fact, they might even think it's sweet. He got mad and said that there was nothing sweet about getting embarrassed on *his* wedding day. We argued for over 2 hours just going back and forth on the issue.


Later, I got a call from his mother telling me that I should start being rational and look at things from her son's prespective. She suggested we get a ""professional"" cake for the wedding then have my daughter maybe bake some cupcakes for the buffett or something. But I wasn't convinced and felt like they're deciding my wedding's plans for me and forcing what they want on me.

AITA for not carrying on my family’s tradition?,"My (18F) family has a “tradition” that goes back 5 generations, and that is the oldest of the family joins the military (only the 4 main branches). My mom was in the army and retired as a major, my grandpa was in the Air Force and retired as a Colonel I believe, my great grandpa was in the Navy, my great great grandfather was a marine, and my great x3 grandfather was also a Marine. My family is VERY proud of this fact and has been throwing this in my face since I was fresh out the cooter.

With the school year coming to an end and I turned 18 last month, my mom has been forcing me to do fitness courses and buying textbooks to help me study for the ASVAB. Now I would have rebelled against this awhile ago but sadly my younger brother past away a few years ago and it was really hard on my parents so I’ve just been going along with this until now. Last week, I overheard my mom talking on the phone to a recruiter talking about my options for possibly becoming an officer. I guess the realization finally hit. I told my mom I’m not joining a few days ago and a huge fight happened. But I basically “wasted her time” and she called me a disappointment but I think I have a right to choose.

AITA for talking to my MIL like a kid when she touched my belly?,"My husband and I are expecting our firs baby (yei!), we've have some ups and downs with his parents because they don't understand boundaries, but overall it's been really good. For some context, I (24F) come from an abusive home and I can't stand being touched, before getting pregnant this wasn't a problem with my in-laws, but now that I'm carrying a baby, it's been awful with my MIL and my SIL because they think they can touch my belly whenever they want to. Both my husband and I have talked to them, and said that while I would rather they don't touch me at all, I can understand this is a big thing as a family, so I would simply like being asked instead of just feeling a hand at random times, but they rarely do it, so I just move when they touch me.

Now, onto the subject, a week ago my best friend threw me a baby shower and I invited my in-laws and since I don't have any blood family left, we let them invite 10 more people which included aunts-cousins and my husband's grandparents.

It was an overall lovely moment, but at one time, I was sitting eating cake while my MIL talked with my FIL's sister, and while telling her something about the baby, she put her hand in my belly and idk, I just didn't like it. So I took her hand, removed it and said ''No, no, you know I've told you not to touch without asking firs. You know how to ask first, do you? It's easy!'' with the most condescending voice I had. Both my MIL and my FIL's sister looked at me shocked, and then my FIL's sister laughed but my MIL got red in the face.

When it was done, my MIL approached me and said that what I did wasn't nice and she just ''slipped'' so I didn't had to treat her like a kid. I just smiled and said that she touching me after being asked a million times not to was a kid behavior and I just called her out on that. She left, very sad, and when we got home, my FIL called my husband and said he would love for both of us to apologize to each other, but I said no. So he called me an AH.",19958,xlogjp,"NTA.

AITA for sending my boyfriend a photo of me at the hospital?,"I (20F) was recently admitted into a hospital for a night due to a serious but not life-threatening illness. I was completely out of it for several days with horrible pain before my roommate convinced me to get medical help. She took off work to stay with me in the hospital and I cannot express how much her support has helped as my own family lives too far away.

Now I’ve been dating Sam (19M) for about nine months. He knew I was sick and so I texted him when I was first going into the hospital to update him. Since he was working he didn’t read the message until much later. I sent him around 6 texts updating him with what the nurses were saying and including a photo of me on IV giving a thumbs up. It was my first time ever in the hospital and I just wanted to keep the shitty situation as light-hearted as possible.

He responded a few hours later with a thumbs up and that was all. I asked if everything was all right and he said “yeah just you being in the hospital is giving me a lot of anxiety, i’d rather not see you looking like that.” I told him that was okay and didn’t message him for the rest of the night, not thinking much of it. 

The next afternoon his mom called me asking if I was okay. She had the impression that I sent him the hospital photo after he told me not to share any information and was disrespecting his request. She reminded me that his grandfather only died a year earlier where Sam had to spend a lot of time in and out of the hospital so the updates were making him grieve all over again. I apologized to her and sent him a text saying that I didn’t mean to hurt his feelings. He left me on read.

My roommate thinks I didn’t do anything wrong at all and he’s being too sensitive/immature for involving his mom. Personally I think this is a bit unfair as he was really close with his grandfather and struggles with anxiety. I feel really really guilty as I know how mental health can be and never want him to suffer. AITA?

UPDATE:

This morning I woke up to a text from Sam asking for a break. He told me he needed to focus on himself and that “there is too much drama in this relationship”. I agree.

I’ve been with Sam through all of his anxiety attacks, holding him crying in my arms more times than I can count. He has never done the same for me. I’ve made excuses over and over again for this behavior. I’ve begged him to go to therapy and he’s always refused. This hospital stay (and your comments) have been eye-opening.

Oh and his mom? “she reminded me to let go of my feeling and do what’s best for me. i’m starting up therapy bc i’ll be needing the support when you’re gone.” I actually laughed out loud at that one. She hasn't reached out to me yet and I hope she never does.

My roommate and I are figuring out how to end things once and for all. So yep, that's it for now. Feeling a lot of emotions but I know it's for the best.

AITA for eating my husband's entire birthday cake by myself?,"


I'll preface this by saying that my husband's family and I don't get along, like AT ALL. we're rarely ever on good terms and for my mental health I decided to put distance between us. Especially after I was blamed for my most recent miscarriage (that happened 3 months ago). My husband can still see and visit them whenever he wants. For me, I don't attend any of their events not even thanksgiving nor christmas.



My husband's 30th birthday was 2 days ago. I planned to celebrate with him. I bought a cake and a gift but he said that his family invited him to celebrate his birthday and he *""really really really""* wanted to go because the birthday parties his family throw are like no others. We had an argument over this but he told me to wait for him til he finish celebrating there with his family then we could celebrate together at home and eat cake.



After he left I felt so terrible. I called him but he turned his phone off. I was so mad I took the cake and brought it to the living room and started eating from it. I ate the whole thing not saving him a single piece (guess I was so angry and it made me hungry). He came home and saw what I did and blew up saying I did this to spiteful and to punish him for not ""ditching his family on his birthday"" like I ""wanted him to"". I reminded him I paid for the cake but he called me petty and nuts. He ranted and ranted then said that he didn't get to eat cake at his parents house because lots of kids were there and he didn't get enough cake and what I did was 10 times worse.

AITA for refusing to put my packaged snacks back in the fridge per my husband's request?,"Hi.


I, f34, am diabetic and keeping packaged snacks near me is essential, because often times I get low blood suger, due to issues I have with appetite (I don't eat lunch or dinner properly).


My brother in law and his pregnant wife moved in with us a month ago, The issue began when my SIL started eating my snacks that I usually keep inside the fridge, I tried buying more snacks but sometimes they run out and I end up drinking water mixed with sugar in the middle of the night because I don't have anything else to eat and my husband won't go out to the store and get me anything. I told my husband and he told me to be patient with his brother's wife because she's pregnant and is considered ""sort of sick"" so she needs to be cut some slack.

I had it to be honest, I moved all my snacks into the bedroom and inside a box just to keep them safe. SIL said it was strange that I no longer buy snacks but I told her that I actually still do, I just keep them safe in my room so no one can touch them. She side-eyed me then an argument ensued after my husband and his brother came home. My husband berated me for being rude to SIL and childish for moving the snacks and keeping them in the bedroom. I told him why I did that though, he know what was up but he said I overreacted and that there was no harm in sharing. He demanded I put whatever snacks I have back into the fridge and stop acting like a child but I said that I won't and if his SIL and her husband get upset then they need to understand that I'm diabetic and need those snacks essentially. He yelled in my face calling me childish then walked out.

BIL and SIL are cold shouldering me. and my husband keeps pushing for me to put the snacks back into the fridge where they belong or he won't speak to me as well.

AITA for throwing away the expensive whiskey my brother got me for my 40th?,"I'm 40M, just turned forty last week. I'm divorced and have 2 teenage kids with my ex wife, 17M and 14F. 

My whole family came to my and my GF's appartment last Saturday for my birthday party: my parents, some aunts and uncles, some cousins, my 3 brothers with their families, my two kids (and my GF's 15yro son who lives with us). 

I am a recovered alcoholic, I've been sober for 6 years now. Alcohol absolutely ruined my life, it destroyed my marriage and nuked my relationship with my kids for years. I don't allow alcohol in my home now, for anyone. It just isn't served or tolerated here. My entire family knows this very well, as they know my entire history with alcohol. 

For my 40th, my brother bought me a very expensive bottle of whiskey, it had writing on it, a very heavy bottle and very old whiskey, so it probably cost him a couple hundred bucks. 

When he gave me the bottle, I was shocked, and said I don't drink, but thanks for the gift. He then opened the bottle and started pouring shots in plastic cups for everyone. My daughter had a panic attack at the smell of the alcohol (which I am painfully aware is my fault and I will never forgive myself for it), so I told my brother to take the alcohol out on the balcony and just leave it there. He wouldn't do it, and took a shot of the whiskey. 

I told him to seriously stop it and he proceeded to pour the whiskey. He then said I am acting like a sober saint now, when I ruined everyone's birthdays for years with my drinking. I told him to come to the hallway with me and talk it out. He refused and put a glass of whiskey in my hand. 

I took the trash can, threw the whiskey bottle in it and the plastic cups, and took the trash out. 

My brother then stormed off and my mom followed him. She later called me, demanding an apology for disrespecting my brother like that. My dad said I was being overly sensitive, and some of my other family members also agree.

AITA for denying my mom access to her grandson because she refuses to help me,"My husband and I (32f) are first time parents to an 8-month-old son, Jack. I’ve struggled since he was born. I had a difficult pregnancy. My son had colic, and my maternity leave was short. I was diagnosed with PPD and am getting treatment. 

My husband and I both have demanding jobs. I’d love to quit, but we can’t afford it right now. I don’t have many friends in the state where we live, and I’m lonely. My MIL is in poor health, and my husband is gone 2x per week helping her. I haven’t had a day or evening off since Jack was born. Plus, our home was flooded by a broken pipe 5 months ago. Handling the cleanup has been a nightmare.  

My mom (67f) lives 1 hour away and has never once offered to help with anything. We’ve always had a pretty good relationship. She was a stay-at-home mom and was very loving and devoted to my brother, sister, and me. She’s an empty nester and spends her days doing yoga and seeing friends.

My mom wants see the baby if it’s very low effort. I asked her a few times if she could babysit or run an errand, but she always says no. Once I called her at the height of my PPD sobbing, saying I was scared to be alone and could she come over. But she had brunch plans. I stopped asking for anything until today…

My best friend of 25+ years is getting married next weekend in State B, which is 2 hours away by plane. I’m the maid of honor and my husband is officiating. Children are not invited because the venue is unsafe. About 7 months ago we started looking for someone to watch Jack. We called everyone we could think of. After a month of searching, we finally found a babysitter in State B through a friend of a friend. 

Well, the babysitter called on Friday and cancelled. I’ve spent the past 3 days calling  childcare agencies with zero luck. I finally explained my desperation to my mom and asked if she could watch Jack for 24 hours. Or I offered to fly my mom to State B with us, get her a hotel room, and she’d then only need to watch him for 5 hours. I was in tears begging her, but my mom said no. She has a yoga class she doesn’t want to cancel. 

It was the straw that broke the camel’s back after months of no empathy as I flounder with PPD. I told my mom that since she is never willing to help ever, I will be cutting off all contact and she won’t get to see her grandson.

AITA for serving my boyfriend's parents pizza for dinner?,"Hi. so this happened last night. I'm still hella confused by this whole thing.


So, I f28 have been dating my boyfriend m31 for 7 months. His family are of italian origins and they take a lot of pride in it.


They invited me over to their house several times. Last night, his parents came over to the apt for the first time. They said they were visiting a friend and decided to stop by for dinner. I freaked out when they said dinner because it was late, and I was working and had no time to cook. So I ordered pizza for all of us.


The second his parents saw the pizza they got pissed. His dad gave me a nasty stare then said that I ""intentionally"" served them pizza just because they were ""italians"" in other words he claimed I was mocking them and their food and assuming that just cause they're italian then they'd only eat italian food which he called ""racist"". I was confused I said I didn't think it was interepreted that way but he said ""If you have asian guests over do you serve them susi? how would you like if we only serve you macdonalds and fries every time you visit since that's what americans eat?"" I was stunned by his words. basically, he was saying that just because they're italian then I shouldn't assume they'd like to have pizza but...who doesn't like pizza?. He and my boyfriend's mom got up and said they wanted to leave. My boyfriend tried to get them to stay and take it easy but they left eventually. He blew up saying I messed by serving them pizza and ""insulting them indirectly"" he told me to call and apologize but I said no and that I didn't have time to cook anything after they showed up unexpectedly. He got more upset and asked if his parents needed permission to visit *him* I backed off thinking he'd call down. nut he kept saying I insulted his parents and I need to apologize.

AITA for buying personalized stationery for my daughter so it can’t be redistributed in class?,"My little girl, Mia (F9) has started a new school recently. We moved started and she had to start new school. I got a list of supplies that the teacher required plus extras like extra packs of crayons, etc. You know the deal.
While I don’t necessarily agree with this, it’s  not a hill I, willing to die on so I got everything on that list. 
However, I also got my child her own supplies. Now, the list didn’t say to not label them. Mia is very particular on what type of stationery she likes. I’ve heard horror stories of kids stuff being redistrubuted and them ending up with crappy supplies so I sat down with Mia and we got her personalised binders and notebooks and pencils with her name on etsy. It’s all part of the item so can’t  be removed and given to another kid (like I said, as requested, I bought extra binders, etc.).

It turns out that I was right to do so. When Mia got home, she brought a passive aggressive note from the teacher about Mia’s supplies. Apparently, she tried to gather all supplies and have kids pick another one.

She requested that I switch Mia’s supplies to generic ones which I’m refusing to do. 

The teacher now requested that I stop by to have a chat regarding Mia’s supplies.

AITA For giving my son's dog to his ex wife.,"To begin with I love my son with all my heart.  But he blew up his marriage by cheating and has moved back home. 

I F55 have three children.  My oldest is my daughter 30, then my twins 25MF. 

My oldest just got married to a wonderful man.  My younger daughter is going to grad school overseas and that leaves my son.  Let's call him Carlos.  

He has always been a handful. He got married when he was 20.  His ex wife had a three year old daughter whom I love and no matter what I am her grandmother.  They had a child together, my other grandchild. He is two.  

COVID caused a lot of stress in his life and he works in a fly in fly out camp job.  He is gone for two weeks at a time.  Then home for two weeks.  He makes very good money and enjoys spending it. Maybe a little bit too much. 

Carlos cheated on his wife with a coworker.  I am not judging him.  I am not perfect. But he chose to leave his wife and children.  And move back home.  It doesn't really make sense for him to rent an apartment or something for the 12 days a month he is home.  So I allowed it.  But he decided to be an ass, in my opinion, and bring his dog with him.  

My grandbabies love this dog.  But he is trying to punish his ex for telling him to leave.  

It is a beautiful border collie and it is the perfect dog for their home.  Huge yard, lots of walking trails nearby, even an off leash park only a ten minute drive away.  

I live in an apartment downtown. I am allowed a dog but if I were to have one it would be something sedate and non shedding like a Maltese. 

I swear I tried watching this dog.  But my son is irresponsible.  He doesn't walk him much. He doesn't brush the dog.  He is just holding on to the dog to lever his way into his ex's life.  

The last straw was this last time off work.  He was away for two weeks, Nd then came home for one day before flying off to the United States for a vacation with his new girlfriend.  

So I called my DIL, checked that she wanted the pup back, she almost cried with joy, packed up everything that belonged to the dog and took him over there.  My grandchildren were ecstatic.  

My son just came home for three days before he has to leave for work and asked where his dog is.  I told him the truth.  

He is calling me an asshole for giving away his pet.  Also because I said that if he tried to go get the dog and bring it back he was not welcome in my home.

AITA for rubbing it in my boyfriend's face how much I make in front of our friends?,"We've been together for 2 years, living together for 1. When we were on our first date he asked if I pursued a higher education after high school, which I didn't. I explained that I failed high school and he couldn't believe it.

He finds it amusing to tease me about it and truthfully it doesn't bother me. I have a good job and I've done great things despite not having a traditional education. At the very worst it's a little annoying but I refuse to lose sleep over it.

AITA for telling my wife my job has to come before hers?,"Background:

Me (35m), my wife (34f), and our two kids (3 and 5) live in a VHCOL city. I made about 5x as much as my wife, so we do pretty well. If my income were the same as my wifes we would not be able to afford to live in our city.

My job is pretty low stress, about 35ish hours a week with the only requirement that I be ""on call"" for 1 week out each month. Normally nothing ever happens, so I do my usual routine with the understanding with my wife that if I am needed I will drop whatever we are doing and work until the work issue is resolved. This only ever happens once every quarter and only lasts a few hours.

My wife on the other hand has a much more stressful job, her boss is incredibly demanding, and often demands random and inane things just as a power play with her subordinates. She usually works about 45-50 hours a week. As a result, I take care of most home stuff, drop off / pick up kids from daycare, cook meals, and generally keep the house clean.


The AITA Incident:

It was an on-call week after work hours when my wife got a text from her boss about fulfilling an emergency 'request' for a client. My wife complained to me that this request really could wait until tomorrow but she would rather get it done so she doesnt have to listen to her boss bitch at her in the morning if its not done. I had no problem with it, but I reminded her that I am on-call so I might need to switch with her if something came up, she made a grunt of acknowledgement but nothing beyond that.

About 2 hours later I get an all-hands call to immediately come into the office. Normally I can resolve issues remotely, but we had an issue that prevented us from remoting in. I rush upstairs and told me wife I had to leave only for her to turn around and say, ""Sorry but my issue came up first, you are going to have to tell your work you can't."" I was taken aback and told her that no, this issue isn't something I can skip for anything short of 'I am physically in the hospital and can't come in'. She got increasingly angry and started ranting at me, but I told her that I didn't have time for this, and that I am leaving, when I get back we can discuss this. She started crying, but I had no more time, so I left for the office. On the way she called me to continue the argument and in the heat of the moment, I said, ""Look, I respect that you put a lot of time and energy into your work, but we cannot afford our house or lifestyle without my job, so when push comes to shove, my job has to come first otherwise we are going to be on the streets."" She hung up on my after that.

When I got home about 3 hours later (around 11 pm) the kids were crashed out on the living room couch with several bowls of cereal spilled around them. I went upstairs and my wife was locked in the bedroom and refused to talk. In the morning I found out from the kids that she spent the night crying in her room and didn't feed them dinner or tuck them in so they made cereal and had a sleepover in the living room.",19815,w2t6dw,"NTA

Your wife, however, needs to talk to a therapist. Her reaction is not normal nor is it healthy. She should also look for a new job as her current job is clearly interfering with not just her life but her emotional state. She knew you were on call- this was a known, pre-arranged agreement. Her suddenly going back on it & also neglecting your children is not healthy. What if one of the kids choked on the cereal?

WIBTA for calling the police on my boyfriend after he let his brother and his family live in my holiday home without my permission?,"(On mobile sorry for bad formatting)

For context, I (28F) inherited a holiday home from my grandma some time ago. I never really use it as it's roughly a 5 hour drive out from London, where I live. It's relevant to the story that:

-The keys to the holiday home are on a rack, with literally every other key to anything my boyfriend or I own. 
-The holiday house has a security system hooked up to my phone (when it detects someone on the property cameras turn on and I can see them)


My boyfriend's brother (33M) recently had his 4th child. Him and his wife currently live in a 2 bedroom apartment.

So three days ago, they were both over at mine and my boyfriends house with all their kids, we was talking about anything and everything, I was holding the baby. My boyfriend's brother eventually mentioned how I have my holiday home and how it has more than enough space for him and his wife to raise their 4 kids. My exact response was: ""Yeah but I'm not gonna let you live there so..""
He went quiet after that and his wife started to collect their kids and their things, they left about 10 minutes after.
My boyfriend hasn't said anything to me about the conversation, yet I'm feeling bad about my response because I know they really do need the space.

So fast forward to yesterday. I wake up   for work and realise my boyfriend isn't in bed with me, nothing out of the ordinary. He works from 8:30 am . When I'm finally about to walk out the door, I go to grab my keys and notice my holiday home's keys are gone. I look around for them, can't find them, so I call my boyfriend.
First time he doesn't answer, second time he doesn't answer, third time he does. The conversation went:
""Hey have you seen my other house's keys?"" 
""Yes I have them,""
""Cool, why've you got them though?"" 
""Grabbed them by accident. I'll return them when I'm back from work"" 

I thought everything would be fine so I continued with my day and went on to work. Midway through my work day, I get a notification from the house's security system. I open it and find my boyfriend, his brother and his family all outside the door with a moving van in the back. I was fuming.

When I got home, my boyfriend was already there, acting as if everything was normal. I started screaming at him asking why the hell he'd move a family into MY house without my permission. He tried to justify it and say he ""had to help his family"", it honestly just made me more angry. I told him that we were over he has 1 day to get his brother and his family out my house or I would call the police on them all for trespass. 

That all happened at around 6 yesterday (14 hours ago). He hasn't called me or anything, but I fully intend to go through with my threat. But I know they're struggling right now.

So, WIBTA for calling the police?

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice! By searching through the UK's Government website I've managed to figure out what I can legally do. I've also called the police on them already. I haven't recieved any updates on that yet but I'll share them when I can.

EDIT 2: I called the police a small while ago. About 30 minutes ago they came and returned my keys and let me know that the family had been told to leave by them. At first they refused, but eventually they packed their things up and went. My EX boyfriend, his brother and his brother's wife have been blowing up my phone asking why the hell I'd put them and their children through this, I've blocked them all. I feel absolutely terrible about what I did and I know there was probably better ways to handle the situation, I even considered letting them stay after all, but I'm not sure if they would pay rent or anything. 
For the future, I plan to rent the home out, as many of you suggested. But I'm not sure how ex-boyfriend's family would take that.

EDIT 3: I've had better security systems installed on the house AND the locks changed! Thank you to everyone who gave me advice at the time, it helped me get through it mentally. Once again, thank you everyone :)",19801,tvxnam,"NTA. Call the police ASAP, or you could have other problems on your hands (squatters rights etc).

Some nerve! The brother and SIL are a top tier level of entitled to just move right on in (with a bloody moving van no less!) after hearing an explicit no from you. Were they assuming they'd pay no rent??

AITA for telling the step father who raised me that he's not my dad when he didn't treat me like his son?,"My mom married my step father when I was only 1. He had a 1 year old son, and then they had a daughter a year later together. My step brother and I are 16 now and our half sister is 14. Step father is the only father figure I know and I've always called him dad, my actual dad is not in my life.

Growing up I always noticed that he treated me differently, he never mistreated me but he was always more interested his own children than me, in fact he always showed very little interest in me. I've always felt like a second class family member, my mom treats my step brother exactly like me but step father doesn't do the same for me.

Anyway, this last couple of years have been difficult because step father started doing stuff with my siblings, like going on trips, going fishing or hiking, father-children bonding moments as he calls it and he's never taken me with them despite me asking to go, initially he always said maybe next time until I called him out last week and he took me aside and explained that this is for him and his children, I'm not his child like they are, he said he loves me but it's different, he can't dilute the experience by bringing me as well but he said my mom can spend some mother-child moments with me and my sister if she wants to as well, and that it would be good for us to have that only for us. This conversation happened on Friday before they went off for a weekend trip.

My mom told me that this is how he feels, she can't change it but she's made sure I'm always treated equally when it comes to money (which is true) but she can't change the way he feels so I need to accept it. 

I've been thinking all weekend and it was clear to me that when he doesn't see me as his son, it's wrong of me to see him as my dad. So I decided that if I'm the step child he tolerates because of my mom, I'm not going to pretend like we're anything more. I decided to stop calling him dad and go by his first name. So on Sunday night after they returned I said Hi Tom. He was surprised but didn't say anything. At dinner he asked me what was that about and I explained that I don't want to dilute the experience he has with his real children by calling him dad when clearly I'm not his son. It's something that should be kept for his actual children. I was told to go to my room by my mom. Later she came to me and said this has hurt him and I should apologize, I said I'm just following his lead and treating him exactly like how he wants to be treated by his actions, and if he's hurt then he should look in the mirror because that's his actions.

My mom told me in the end that this is the man who has raised me all my life and I need to apologize and show remorse. She says he's 95% of the way for being a dad to me, I shouldn't ignore all of that and focus on the missing 5% and reject him entirely. I declined, said he's the one who needs to apologize if he wants things to change between us. Am I being the asshole in this situation?",19776,vrgzko,So call him Dam; you know 95% Dad and 5% Tom.,1300,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vrgzko/aita_for_telling_the_step_father_who_raised_me/
AITA for telling my mother that she can pay for my daughters funeral since she's so concerned about it?,"My daughter died 8 weeks ago from SIDS. She was 6 days old and as you can imagine, it devastated the entire family. I've been planning her funeral but even for a baby, its quite expensive. 

My mother has been hounding me about ""getting it over and done with"" because in her culture, peoples funeral happens a few days after their death. I've been saving for the past few weeks to give my baby the funeral she deserves and particularly for the urn I would like. 

I finally snapped at her yesterday, and said since she's so concerned about speeding up the process, then she can pay for the fucking thing. 

This got her all upset, since she was trying to honor her culture. My dad thinks I was a bit of an ass for snapping at her, but mostly for suggesting she pay. AITA?",19767,tqctzs,"I also lost my son to SIDS at 27 days old.

The funeral home did not charge us.  I know many others that were not charged for their infants funeral as well.  It is considered bad form in the funeral world to take money from grieving parents for an infants funeral. So typically you are only charged for the things out of their hands, like flowers (which people are more than willing to donate)  and the cremation cost - and cremation is much cheaper. All in all my son's funeral was under $500 with the urn. If burial is preferred there are organizations that can help. In 8 years of being a part of the loss community, I've only heard maybe a dozen people say the funeral home would take their money and that is out of thousands of stories (talking about your child's funeral is a big topic - a lot find it therapeutic)

I belong to a large number of infant loss groups I absolutely welcome you to message me and I can help you with some groups and resources if you need.

I would talk to several funeral homes in your area, especially family owned ones, I assure you that one will work with you on the cost if they even charge you at all.

I can not put into words how sorry i am for your loss.

AITA for refusing to give my ex-husband's girlfriend a part of the inheritance?,"I (58F) was married to a man for 16 years and we had a son. After my son was killed by a drunk driver we couldn't support each other. We divorced 6 years ago, I moved to a different state and we haven't spoken since then.

About a month ago I was contacted by the executor of his will and informed of his death. His latest will was written about a year ago.

When I went I was informed that he left me everything, except for $10k that he left to his girlfriend. They were together for 2 years and lived in the same house.

Now his girlfriend is demanding that I surrender all of the inheritance to her. She says that I wasn't the one that was there for him when he was drowning in his grief, that I moved on while he was still feeling guilt over the death of our son.

I have refused so far, but I still feel a bit guilty since I am planning to sell the house (our marital house, I couldn't bear to stay in it after our son's death) so she will have to look for housing (she can't afford to, she doesn't have a job). Also I make a good living and own a house outright (inherited from my parents).

So AITA?

Edit: since this seems like a frequent question: I offered her to stay at the house free of charge for the next 6 months before I put it on the market. Also I offered her her choice of whatever she wants to take from my ex's personal affects and house furniture she wants to take.

AITA for filing a report against my late husband's colleague and getting him fired?,"


My husband (33) passed away 3 weeks ago. He used to work for this company for 4 years. He'd known lots of people and made some many friends. 

For days I kept getting texts from his colleague ""Ted"". I Don't know him personally I had no idea how he even got my number. When he first texted me I texted ""where did you get my number?"" And he replied saying he got it from my husband. At first I felt annoyed but then I started getting flirty texts from him. They started getting more and more inappropriate, I warned him to stop but he sent me a d Pic one night at 3am and asked if I ""needed company"" since he ""knew I was lonely"". I was appalled and enraged I couldn't even sleep at night. I waited til the early morning to go to the company, straight to his boss and filed a report against after explaining in details about his behavior. He ended up getting fired because the other colleagues said he did me and my husband wrong and disrespected his memory.

He started arguing about how low what I did was coming to his work in hopes of ruining his livelihood. He kept saying it was between him and I and his work place had nothing to do with it but I told him I've known only as my husband's colleague and he was his colleague. He and a friend of his said that I was aiming to get him fired and that he ""did nothing"" wrong and I could've talked it out with him instead. 

My mom called him a pos for doing this to my husband and me but also said that he had a point in that I shouldn't come after his livelihood since the guys has a kid to provide for.

AITA for wearing the same color as the bride as a wedding harpist and not changing?,"So I (f18) was asked to play the harp at a friend of my fathers wedding. Normally, I would ask for payment beforehand, but since it was a family friend, they asked if they could just pay me at the reception and I told them yes. The dates worked out for me, and it was set in a church about 1 hour from my house. I showed the dress I planned to wear to the bride when we went over the music she wanted and at the rehearsal, but only on a hanger. It looks like it would be ugly on a hanger, as it’s just navy blue with long sleeves and floor length, but it’s surprisingly pretty. 

I got to the venue about 4 hours early, so my harp would have time to acclimate to the room. When I got there, the brides mother came to give me my corsage, and when she saw me, she demanded I change my dress. I laughed because I’ve known her for years, and then realized she wasn’t joking. I asked what was wrong with it and she said that the bride went with a non traditional dress that was also navy blue. I panicked a little, because this is her wedding and I felt really bad, but she and her groom had approved it twice. I told the mother, and she asked if I had any other color I could change into. I don’t bring extra dresses unless my dress somehow doesn’t get approved beforehand, so I didn’t. She then told me to go to the bridal shop 20 minutes away, and buy a new dress. I refused, because those dresses would cost about what I was getting paid for this wedding, and I told her I couldn’t afford it. I felt bad, but she begrudgingly walked away. 

The actual wedding went smoothly, and after everyone else had left the church and congratulated the bride, I stopped to talk to her. I explained what the mother in law said, and she said that it was fine and that they weren’t thinking when they approved my dress. At the reception, when I talked for he mother in law about payment, she refused to pay me. I didn’t want to cause a scene,
but the bride came over and heard us talking. 

This time, she was also upset with me and also refused to pay me. I didn’t know what to do. As my parents were busy and couldn’t attend this wedding, I didn’t have anyone there to back me up. A lot of people assume harpists come from a lot of money because of how expensive harps are, but I’ve been renting a harp since 4th grade, and when my teacher passed, we bought it for an amazing deal. I also charge a lot less than most musicians would, but I have a college payment due in a few days and I can’t afford it. I got my parents involved when I got home, and my dad talked to his friend (the father of the groom) who was there when they approved the dress, and he got the payment to me. I still feel really bad, but I don’t think there was anything I could have done. Should I have just sucked it up and bought a new dress? AITA?",19714,vl2rmu,"Girl no, they just wanted to stiff you.

AITA for asking my husband to stay with his family while he’s unemployed?,"My husband (32) and I (30) have been married for just over a year now and things couldn’t be rockier. 

I have a good job and make a decent amount of money, whereas my husband made not as much as me. Due to this, and the fact he was still living with his parents when we got married, we decided he would move in with me and I would continue to pay the rent and bills as long as he put money toward other things we may need as a couple. My name is the only one on the lease. 

However, once we got married, he started to cut down on his work hours without saying anything first. He gave the explanation that I made plenty of money for the both of us so he could just work part time and do the work around the house while I was the main breadwinner. I was fine with this, a little upset that he had just assumed this would be okay but I didn’t say anything as this felt fair. 

He did do some work around the house initially, but spent the majority of his time going out to the bar, playing video games, etc. to the point where I was the one both working *and* doing the cooking, cleaning and other household chores. 

My husband told me he was laid off two months ago for reasons out of his control. I assumed in this time that he would begin job hunting, and I began to pay for everything. 

While I do earn a decent amount of money, it’s not to the point where I can pay for rent, bills, groceries, insurance, contribute to emergency savings and finance the lifestyle my husband had started indulging in. I began paying for his nights out, subbing him money for trips to look for work, etc. all while I was under the assumption he would be searching for a new job. At least to finance his hobbies. 

About a week ago, I asked him how the job hunt was going and he told me that he didn’t feel like it was worth it. He said to me that he was comfortable with what we had now and I wasn’t happy to say the least. 

I confronted him about how I was doing everything to finance and take care of our household while he sat around and played video games (I was being an ass here, I’ll admit) and during this argument he let slip that he had actually quit and never looked for another job. I was furious that he had lied to me and told him I didn’t want him in my home right now. 

Fast forward to now. My in-laws are understanding to an extent but are calling me an asshole for not wanting him to come back home until he gets a job. I have seen my husband in this time but never in our home, always out somewhere. I no longer pay for everything and his attitude toward me is making me question our entire relationship. 

He’s calling me an asshole for doing this to him, and I’m beginning to think he’s right. Am I an asshole?",19693,wr5rq7,">He’s calling me an asshole for doing this to him,

AITA for not doing anything for christmas this year and making my husband livid?,"


So I'm a stay at home mom with 3 kids. My husband works full time and gets an okay- salary BUT he's tightened the grip on spending for the past 4 months to be able to save up to go watch the football event overseas. He's literally obssessed with anything to do with football. He said he rarely ever gets to do what he wants and so I didn't want to judge him since it's his money eventually.


We discussed plans for christmas and he told me to handle everything since he won't be back til Dec. 20th. He told me he had put aside money for christmas decoration, food, gifts, kids needs etc. The money in total was 100$. I was completely shocked I told him 100$ for an entire family's christmas celebration was ridiculously not enough. He shrugged saying it's all he's got but I pointed out how he's paying for his friend's and his girlfriend's travel expenses. He told me to just ""take it"" but I said that if he decided to leave me with just 100 bucks then I won't be doing anything for christmas. We had lots of arguments and couldn't get this resolved.



He's in Qatar now (he left days ago). Yesterday, while I was cleaning I found an envelope with the same 100$ and a note from him telling me ""to make it work"". I sent him a message that I've decided that I won't be doing anything for christmas with this little money, period. He was livid he just kept sending an angry message after another calling me ""spoiled"" and telling me to stop expecting to live like I was still living in my parents house and to stop trying to ""rob"" the kids of enjoying the holidays like the other kids.

AITA(24f) for not lying about my profession?,"Hello everyone,

This happened hours ago and my mind is boggled. Me(24f) my fiance(28m) went to his bestfriends, Alex(30m) and his now-fiancee Nell(27f) engagement party today.

Essentially at the engagement party, I was talking to an older lady who had spotted my iron ring because she was wearing one as well. (A iron ring is presented to engineers in Canada once they graduate) and I was asking her a whole bunch of questions about her career, which field of engineering shes in etc. Turns out she was Nell's future MIL's sister then Nell and Alex came over to say hi and I congratulated them both. Then Nells MIL's sister and I continued our conversation and then Nell spoke up and said ""Uhm, why are you lying about being an engineer? Don't you work at victorias secret or something?"" And I was like ""Yeah I used to work at victorias secret when I was in Uni but now I work as a Software engineer"" and then Nell started laughing a bit and said ""No you don't, stop lying"" and everyone visibly got really awkward.

My fiancee came over and greeted everyone, and Nell continued to berate me in front of everyone saying that I was lying about my job, and how my fiance shouldn't be enabling me to lie to everyone by saying that I'm an engineer. I then told her to stop and I stood my ground and said ""I wouldn't ever lie about my job, I worked really hard to get where I am"" and then Nell got extremely upset and started saying that I'm ruining her engagement party, I'm making everything about myself and that someone like me cannot be in that field of work.

My fiance got upset and asked Alex if Nell was drunk or not because what she was saying to me was out of line and that she has no right whatsoever to speak to me like that. Then me and him both left early and I keep on getting calls and texts from her friends calling me a b\*tch for being stand-offish. My fiance got a call from Alex asking us to not make this a big deal and my fiance told him we're not going to communicate with them any further until Nell apologizes to me.

I(28F) have lived with my BF(30M) for 3 years now. When I first stayed the night and he overslept I woke him up. He woke up in a bad mood and after a big fight made it absolutely clear that I should not wake him up even if I knew he would be late to meeting the Pope (his words)

After I calmed down I wrote a ""contract"" that said I would never wake him up under any circumstance short of an emergency as long as he never blames me for oversleeping. He laughed and signed it.

I woke up at 5am like usual, did all my stuff, by the time it was 7am he didn't wake up. I left the house at 8.15am and he was still asleep.

When I got back he was there and he was very angry, he started shouting and blamed me for being late, said I should have woken him when I noticed he overslept. All I did was stay silent untill he stopped shouting then showed him the paper he signed.

Yesterday when I came back from work dinner was ready so I plated it up for everyone while my wife was washing her hands (my kids like their food cut up) I was cutting their chickens into pieces and it looked a bit pink I told my wife to look at it and she said “it’s a little pink but it’s fine”. I told her I’m not letting them eat this if it’s pink, she told me to stop being a baby and it won’t kill them. I kept telling her it’s pink in the middle they shouldn’t eat that they can get food poisoning and that’s it’s dangerous for them. She told me “if you don’t want them eating it then you can cook their dinner”. 

I made them cheese and ham toasties, also made her one but she didn’t eat it. She told me she isn’t talking to me if I think her cooking is horrible.

AITA for not wanting my husband to walk his sister down the aisle?,"

My husband, Mike (37) is the eldest in his family. He's pretty close with his sister Beth, (28) and they spend almost all week together. Beth had issues with her father growing up. She went no contact with him after he took her first car and damaged it. She only remained in contact with Mike since everybody else judged her for going no contact.


She's getting married to her fiance of 3 years. From what I understand, she and her dad are slowly getting reconciled, but she made it clear she wants him to take no part in the wedding. She asked Mike if he could walk her down the aisle and he agreed. I have to say that I was taken aback and it felt a bit odd for me because, her dad is alive, they're on speaking terms again, he's gonna be there at the wedding so the logical thing to do is have him walk her down the aisle. This role isn't for her older brother but her father. Not to mention how FIL will feel about it. I brought this up with Beth and she had an attitude and implied that I was just saying this and objecting because of how I feel about the situation not how our traditions should be practiced. We got into an argument and I went home.


Mike thinks I'm being unreasonable and possibly causing him to miss something so sentimental and that if anything, he feels honored to be asked to do this for her, and said that I should stop worrying about what others might say.

“Now we’re having this conflict (3 of us) and can not seem to reach a resolution”

Yeah, because you’re offering your opinion where it’s not wanted and trying to make a decision that’s not yours to make. The way this gets resolved is you saying “I’m sorry for my behavior. You are right I am objecting because of how I feel, and this is not my decision nor something I should be pushing my feelings on.” You then be happy that your husband is so close with his sister that she wants him to walk her down the aisle.

AITA for sitting on a man's hand after he refused to remove it from the empty seat?,"
Pretty sure I was an asshole here but we'll see.


So, I, f30, am 8 months pregnant. I take public transport to work daily. I'm always exhausted cause I have to work extra time to be able to afford basic necessities. I take the bus to work everyday and often times it's packed, but I get lucky enough when decent folks volunteer their seats for me. Now I should mention that I Don use my pregnancy as an excuse to get what I want but people just offer me their places by themselves whichs kind and sweet.


Wednesday, I get on the bus like usual but this time there's one empty seat, I go to sit but i find a guy in his business attire sitting there with his hand on the empty seat (sort of like resting it?) I say excuse me and ask him to remove his hand so I could sit, but he tells me the seat was ""taken"". I ask by who and he says his hand. Ngl....I laughed a little but wasn't feeling well so I ask him to remove it so I could sit but he refuses again, folks start staring I tell him I'm tired and needed to sit and he replies saying my pregnancy isn't his problem. I had enough at this point, my legs were burning and my back was hurting, so I go ahead and sit on his hand. He freaks out and tries to removes it quickly while shouting at me. He then starts arguing about how disrespectful i was to do this inappropriate thing and in public no less, I argue back ngl but then he gets off after saying I was being inappropriate and disrespectful. Everyone stares at me and I just sit there feeling a bit of shame about what happened.


I tell my husband about this incident and he wtf'd the entire time, then says that I did indeed act inappropriately and shouldn't have made this guy uncomfortable by sitting on his hand like that. He tells me I fucked up and this was totally inappropriate despite me saying I was so tired of standing and was in desperate need to sit down.

AITA?

ETA several points- like I said I do get offered seats from others so I'm being treated well most of the time, but unfortunately run into some people who don't do that. This guys seemed to be upset about something and then the argument probably made it worse. I could've de-escalated by maybe talking to the driver? How ever, I'm pretty sure he didn't pay for the seat just to put his hand on it (who does that?). Also, most of the passengers were younger folks that day.

AITA for not telling my dad that I had cancelled ''our'' hotel reservation after he insisted on taking my step-sister?,"My (17F)  parents divorced ten years ago because my dad cheated on my mom. He married the other woman who had 2 kids, my step-sister Julia(17F) and my step-brother Josh (14M), while my dad cheated their mom didn't because their dad had already passed away. 

Before that I was a total daddy's girl, I adored him and I was glued to his hip, my mom encouraged me to keep a relationship with him after they split, his new wife family never paid much attention to me, they weren't mean nor good, but at first I always had to share my dad with them whenever I visited. If we went hiking or fishing, they had to come, if we went to the movies, had dinner outside or anything, they had to come. I remember I used to cry at night because I couldn't understand. 

This stopped when I turned 15 because I wanted to do something special with just my dad then and when he said that we should invite my stepbrothers I just broke down crying asking him why he never wanted to spend time with me alone, we had a long talk when I got to vent how awful I felt just sitting there waiting for him to turn his head and notice me because if I tried to talk or have his attention, they would get in the middle while ignoring me and he apologized, after that, we would spend more time 1-1 and just a very few instance with all of them. I won't lie, I really enjoyed it, I could really talk with my dad, do fun stuff and be around him without having to wait for my stepbrothers to stop talking to him or anything. 

Julia and I'll be graduating this summer, I got an early acceptance to my college of choice and when I told my parents, both decided to do something to celebrate. My mom and I will be having a getaway weekend to the spa and my dad said he would take me to the beach. I was honestly really excited so I offered to pay for the hotel reservation because I wanted to feel mature (lo) my dad said no a bunch of times but I ended up convincing him. We were supposed to leave today but when he came to pick me up, my step-sister was there, he said it was a surprise since ''both of his girls'' were graduating, apparently she begged him to come with us and he agreed, saying that she could get his bed and he'll sleep on the floor between us. I could feel my eyes burning and I told him that this wasn't the deal, he tried to convince me but he ended up leaving with her.

In my rage, I called the hotel to cancel the room and I didn't told my dad. When they arrived he tried to check in and when he couldn't, he called me, I only said ''yeah, I cancelled it.'' and hung up. He sent me a long text apologizing and my mom said that what I did wasn't okay and that I owe them an apology, apparently they're on their way back because they couldn't find an hotel.

ETA: As someone suggested I'm adding this, the trip with my dad and the spa getaway with my mom was because I got an early acceptance nor because I was graduating high school, that why Julia had no business being there. My dad did asked about inviting her and I said no. 

I also informed my dad that since he keeps hurting me and putting his other family above what I explicitly ask him for then I would rather go NC with him and that he was currently uninvited to my graduation. That this was the last time and while I still love him and it hurts my heart that it has come to this, I can't keep doing it anymore, I asked him to not contact me again and I blocked him. As for my mom I explained her everything and after much crying from both parts, she apologized and hugged me because she didn't know.

WIBTA if I cancelled my vacation ticket because my family wants me to share a room with my nieces?,"I (F23) have been planning a family vacation with my older brother (M30) and his wife, my two nieces (F4 and F2) and my parents. Everyone is paying for their own tickets.

The vacation is booked for February. We hadn't discussed room arrangements before, but I knew the room we'd be staying in would have three bedrooms.

So we discussed room arrangements yesterday, and my brother and parents just kind of assumed that I wouldn't mind sharing a room with my nieces, whilst my brother and his wife and my parents get their own rooms.

I said I didn't want to share a room with them, and said that they should be sleeping in my brother and SIL's room since they're their parents. My parents called me dramatic and said that it's not a big deal, and said that my nieces won't give me any trouble. I told them I don't care. They said I'm being a bad aunt and told me to grow up.

I told them if I don't get my own room I'll cancel my ticket, which would result in everyone else having to pay more or find someone else to go in my place because we got a group discount with the resort.

AITA for calling out my husbands coworkers wife for trying to flush a maxi pad down our toilet,"I'm still pretty mad at the whole ordeal. My hubsand's coworker and his wife are both mad at us, and think I humiliated her but I think her lack of common sense is what did it.

&#x200B;

My husband and I recently hosted a cookout at our house for his coworkers, he gets along pretty well with most of them and enjoys hosting. Coworkers wife Julia goes to the hallway bathroom, comes back. I end up going after her, and notice the toilet is clogged and starting to overflow. Something large and white is stuck, I use the plunger to unclog it and lo and behold, a very large bloody maxi pad. Julia was the last person to use the bathroom, so I come out and asked her if she tried to flush a pad down the toilet. She got embarrassed and said yes, and I told her she needed to go clean up the mess she made. There was water all over the floor, with particles of her pad and blood everywhere. I asked her if no one ever taught her not to flush a pad, we have a septic tank and they cost thousands to repair. You don't flush pads, especially not the extra large ones. Its not like she tried to flush a panty liner or something.

&#x200B;

Julia cried and her husband yelled at me, but who does that? Especially at someone else's house? Husbands two female coworkers came to my defense, and pretty much said it was stupid of her to do that. Julia half assed cleaning up her mess, and her and her husband quickly left. All of their coworkers think Julia shouldn't have done that, but my husband and his coworker are having a whole feud about it.

Edit: We have a septic tank. Septic tank repairs here can easily go for around 10,000$. Julia has a septic tank. Julia knows better. When I asked if she would flush a pad in her own home she said no. Julia said she did it because there was no trashcan in there, and she didnt want to walk her pad to a different trashcan. The trashcan from that bathroom was outside being washed because a different coworker got vomit on it. I dont think saving her some embarrassment would be worth paying thousands of dollars to repair.

AITA for asking that my daughter not share a room with a special needs kid?,"I (35f) have four kids, 10F, 6M, 4F and 1F.

Our eldest, 'Izzy' is 10. She is a doll. My son, 'Luke' has autism and ADHD and while lovable, can be a bit of a handful at times. Therefore, Izzy is witness to both the fun and not-so-fun parts of neurodiversity and has developed saintly patience and a knack for helping special needs kids with a sense of maturity beyond her years. 

Particulary notable is her kindness with 'Maisy', a girl in her class with autism and severe anxiety, which has worsened as a result of the tumult of the last few years. Izzy's help to Maisy has been bought to my attention before and I am a super proud mama. Next weekend, school are taking my daughter's class on a trip, and on Thursday, Izzy's teacher asked her to be in a room with Maisy, saying it would make Maisy happy (Maisy has intense separation anxiety and has never been away from home before) but framing it as a choice. Always obedient and wanting to do good by her teachers, Izzy agreed but came home crying saying that she didn't want to be with Maisy, because she wanted a break from having to 'be stressed so others can be happy'. This made my heart break, and I know more than anyone that my daughter deserves a chance to be a kid, as in all the lockdowns, she didn't have her usual outlets of sports clubs and had to spend a lot of time with a cranky Luke whose routine had been destroyed and a toddler who was very excited to have her big sis at home. While my husband and I always tried to do 1:1 activities, it admittedly got harder once his furlough ended and I unexpectedly got pregnant with our youngest. Luke also found the baby difficult sensory-wise, so whichever parent wasn't tending to the baby often had to be elsewhere with Luke meaning not as much attention was on Izzy as we would have liked.

I feel so bad that my daughter has had a rough ride, and frankly want to give her a chance to be a little girl instead of an adult. I contacted her teacher, who is aware of the situation with Luke, who agreed that letting Izzy have a break would be a good thing. Today the school spoke to Maisy's mum, informing her of Maisy's room on the trip. I know the girls in the room and they are lovely but she was clearly unhappy. She asked me to ask Izzy again. When I said that it was her choice and I have to respect it, she sent a trade on how I was bringing Izzy up to be intolerant, how Maisy will feel that Izzy has abandoned her and how I would feel if it is my son. She is now considering pulling Maisy out of the trip as she feels she would not cope with her separation anxiety without Izzy.

My husband thinks that it is the school and Maisy's mum's job, not Izzy's, to accommodate her, but her comments are ringing in my head. After all, I am not just Izzy's mum, but also Luke's and as much as I worry about her missing out, I worry about him being isolated too. I know exactly how Maisy's mum feels, and how much it sucks, yet am not doing the one thing to alleviate her pain. AITA?",19541,ssor10,"NTA.

AITA for kicking my sister out of my house at night because she threw ALL of my food away?,"I seriously can't believe this is a thing, but my parents are really upset at me.

My sister and I grew up together but aren't very close. It really wasn't from any drama (we didn't have a big fight to cause distance), but rather just have opposite personalities and interests. If I had to describe my attitude towards my sister it would be ""apathetic love"". Like, she's my sister so I want her to be healthy and happy, but we just unfortunately don't hang out, call to chat, etc.

She recently received an opportunity to interview for a job near our hometown, and reached out to see if she could stay with me for a week. My mother was ecstatic that my sister might be ""coming home finally"". She moved across the county right after college and hasn't been back in almost 10 years except for Christmas (she spends Thanksgiving with her in-laws) or the one off birthday/business trip/vacation.

I was more than happy to open my home up, thinking that we could maybe bond or deepen our relationship. It was all kind of awkward but nothing horrible until the third night. I came home from drinks with my friends around 10PM, went into my kitchen for a snack, and realized that almost ALL of my food was gone.

I'm not even exaggerating. I swear 90% of my pantry was just gone. I asked my sister and she told me that she was shocked I ate anything with preservatives and ""unnatural"" and that I was ""poisoning my body"" so she took it upon herself to throw away EVERYTHING she deemed unhealthy.

Guys, I'm talking about SO much food both packaged and unpackaged. Even things like spices that weren't fresh were tossed! It was like someone had robbed my kitchen. I demanded that she pay to replace everything, but she dug her heels in and said that she was doing me a favor and that the way I ate was ""disgusting"" (her literal words). I know I'm biased, but my diet isn't even crazy. It's pretty much standard food you'd find at any grocery store.

I was so upset I made her pack up and leave, and she ended up having to take a cab about 30 minutes away to stay with my parents. My mom is absolutely devastated that we're fighting and insists that I apologize in order to keep the peace, because she really hopes my sister will take the job and move back.

I told my mom that if she wanted to lose not one, but both daughters then she'd keep pushing me to apologize for something I feel I have a right to be upset about. My dad says that she's been crying every night though, and I love my mom so much I feel like a huge AH for being stubborn about the situation.

**Edit**: To answer a few questions I was asked/dm'd: Yes, I did invite my sister out to drink with me. She declined, saying that she didn't like going to dive bars and wanted to stay sober because it was a work trip. I respected that decision, but I had already planned to go out with my girlfriends (it was a birthday).

I did the math, and she threw away close to a thousand dollars worth of food. I listed some items in a comment below, but it included: dried pasta, ground beef, pre-cut veggies in a container, juice, canned soups, rice, chicken broth, leftovers, and even bread (because it was white).

AITA for snapping at my friend who keeps ditching me because I now have a child?,"Just over two years ago,  I(f29) unexpectedly got pregnant and now have a beautiful 18 month old daughter, Ciara. 

Over that time my friends circle got considerably smaller but my best friend remained, Mia (f31). Mia doesn’t have kids nor wants kids but she’s been brilliant with Ciara.

I’m a SAHM and obviously don’t have as much time to hang out as I did previously. Mia and I live on the same street (we’re in Manchester, England) and it’s a walking distance between our houses. I’ve told Mia numerous times that she can just pop in whenever she wants to (she works from home) but she rarely does. 

She did at the beginning but it’s been happening less and less. Instead, she keeps suggesting we go out for coffee or pizza or even a drink but I don’t have the time and always just tell her to come over and we’ll have coffee at my place.

She asked if I wanted to go out with her and her other friends for a drink last weekend but I said that no but she’s welcome to come over and we’ll have a few drinks at mine. She said she already had plans and it felt weird to drink when she knows there’s a child around. 

Honestly, I feel neglected. I feel like she put me on a back burner and doesn’t want to be friends anymore. I’m always available but she rarely comes over and I don’t think that’s fair.

Today, I saw her photos from Saturday night out and I was fuming. She ditched me just so she could go and drink like she’s 20 again. I felt rejected and horrible, I thought we were best friends but she clearly doesn’t value me when she won’t even have a few drinks with me at my house.

When she finished work, she called and asked if I fancied going for coffee to town but I asked her to come over again. She said yes but before she disconnected, I heard her mumble “like always.” This really annoyed me.

When she came over, I decided to be open about everything. And while not my proudest or most mature moment, I shouted at her that she’s an awful friend m, that she barely comes over and if she doesn’t want to spend time with me to just say it and stop playing around.

She said she’s always been accommodating but it’s been 2 years and she doesn’t want to spend time with me when there’s always a kid, especially now when she has to watch her language (Mia likes to swear).

I said that she knew I had a child and responsibilities. And she said that Tom (my partner) could take care of Ciara once in a while so I could have a time off.

This felt really intrusive and I told her to mind her own business and not meddle on my marriage. 

I was really angry with her and kicked her out. She called me a selfish asshole on her way out.

AITA for telling my mom she only has one kid?,"My parents divorced when my sister (20f) and I (19m) were 5 and 6 years old. She met her husband three years later. He was a widower with a 7 month old son (I think he was 7 months old when they met). She instantly moved them in and started claiming his son as her own and raising him like us. She got engaged to him and a few weeks before the wedding our dad died. By this point my mom had just become estranged from her entire extended family. She told my dad's parents that if they wanted to see us again soon, they would need to come to her wedding and watch all three of us (including my stepbrother). She then told them after the wedding that going forward if they wanted to see us, or spend time with us, they had to include him. They hadn't wanted to. They tried to argue for time with just us. Offering to pay for it all 100%. But mom said no. She said they needed to come to the house and make an effort with all three and not just take two with them.

My sister and I would argue with mom over one day in particular. My dad's birthday. We celebrated that every year with dad's family after he died, but she wouldn't even let that day be just us and them. Our stepbrother had to be there. She said they did not get to be just our family and we shouldn't see him as any less deserving of being present. But we did. He was not our dad's kid, and had never met him. So why was he deserving of being there? I never got that. She called us selfish for the mindset.

Last year I turned 18 and I moved in with my girlfriend. Once I left home, my stepbrother was no longer invited to anything to do with my dad's family. He no longer saw them. My sister and I also stopped spending any time at mom's house. Then we stopped speaking to them at all. It was quiet for several months and then last week mom showed up where I work and demanded we talk. She told me how she was tired of one of her kids being left out and how sick was it to discard him that way, and why weren't my sister and I advocating for him. I told her she only had one kid, her stepson, and that my sister and I were no longer her kids and my family were no longer forced to include him to see us and that it was all her fault for forcing it in the first place. Then I wished her luck, which was kinda sarcastic not gonna lie, and then asked her to leave.

AITAH for locking up my “valuables” in my house?,"I (21f) and my boyfriend (23m) have been living together for 2 years.
There has always been a bit of money struggle as I used to make more than him and have usually been picking up the slack in our house hold. However I have started a new job and am earning a lot less than before so I’ve started to be more cautious about the amount I am spending.

During our relationship I would usually buy all of his toiletries and most household products. I told him I would not be doing this anymore as I need to cut down my own spending and he also works and is capable of buying things on his own. I thought we had agreed to this but as time has gone on I’ve noticed all of my expensive skin care and even my own deodorant being used up really quickly. I asked him multiple times to please not use my stuff and even bought him his own skin care so that he could have his own things. 

The thing that set me off was that I had bought myself a $220 dollar face wash that is only supposed to be used sparingly. I have horrible ezcema that I have prescriptions for and the products I buy are specifically for my ezcema. I hadn’t used it in a while and when I picked up the bottle it was empty. He laughed and said he would replace it and then refused when he learnt of the price. I took inventory of everything else I owned and found out he had used up to $800 worth of product in around 3 months. I know he isn’t naive because I tell him the price of everything I get and tell him not to use them. 

I ended up buying a safe that I put under the sink and I put everything I had left inside and hid the key so when I go to shower and get ready I can use my own things and not worry about not affording to keep my skin in check. When he found out he lost it and said that I was overreacting and that I don’t trust him. It’s turned into a massive deal and my friends think I’m being harsh. I simply cannot afford to keep buying more skincare, and I’ve even been hospitalised this year due to a huge flare up I had after running out of products. 
He’s taking it very seriously and I don’t know what else to do as I’ve already tried asking. 
Am I the asshole?






UPDATE

Wow I didn’t think I was going to get so much of response. Thank you guys for shattering my rose tinted glasses. 

I had a talk with one of my friends who said they had no idea that he was taking more than $10 products which explains why they all thought I was being harsh. Unfortunately we share a friend group so breaking up was looking really hard.

UNTIL I sat him down for a talk to try to convey why I don’t trust him anymore and how important my skin care is. 

The conversation went on for some time and I actually thought he may be turning a new leaf until he told me that in our first year of being together as a couple (when I had a few flare ups before finding some good products that worked for me) he had been taking my oral steroids that I was prescribed with, thinking that they would make him buff at the gym. The whole year I battled through with insecurities and unbearable pain because I wasn’t able to overcome my flare ups. 

Honestly that was the thing that snapped me completely. I’m staying at my friends house for a week and letting him pack his things and figure out a place to go.

AITA for telling my husband's parents to stop telling people my name is Katherine and for embarrassing them in front of friends?,"My name is Rynn. Just Rynn. Not Katherine. But ever since my ILs have met me, they have gotten the idea that my actual name is Katherine and Rynn is just a nickname. I have asked them not to introduce me or tell people it's my name but they always go back to it. My husband and I took a small break from them when it continued and they apologized and seemed to be doing better. Then for my MILs birthday we were invited to celebrate with them and a couple of her friends came up to me and asked if I was Katherine. They said MIL talked all about me. I decided to get a little bit jokey instead of annoyed and played up on it saying MIL is so forgetful and that I was so sorry she told them the wrong name. That I'll need to write my name on everything she owns so they don't forget. Her friends found it funny but told her it was weird that she gave them the wrong name. She and FIL came up to me close to the end of the party and I told them to stop telling people my name is Katherine and they need to accept that my name isn't up to them.

They claim I was rude and that it was awful for me to try and embarrass them in front of their friends (by joking with MILs friends). My husband told them they should have listened. But they are saying I took it too far and maybe I did.

AITA For being honest with my son that I am not proud of him?,"My wife, Nina, and I became pregnant with our son, Jason, when we were both twenty. We will admit it was an unplanned pregnancy, but we loved our son and kept him. We did our best to raise Jason to be kind, respectful, and treat others well, and we thought we succeeded. Jason worked hard to attend an elite university. Jason and his first wife, Sara, had a daughter, Simone.

Unfortunately, Sara passed in a car accident before Simone’s third birthday. Jason raised Simone until Simone was four. At that time, he met his second wife and moved two hours away. Simone lives with us. Jason visits once every two months at best. He and his wife would stay for the day, buy Simone a present, then Jason would say it was time to leave. Nina and I suspect he only visits and buys Simone the present because his wife makes him.

His wife, Iris is a lovely lady; She insists that Simone should move in with them or they should move closer to us because she wants to be Simone’s stepmom and spend time with her. But Jason shots the idea down because he says Simone moving in or them moving would hurt his career and it is best Simone stay with Nina and me.

Simone is eleven now, and she adores Jason. She makes drawings and cards for him, constantly bakes treats to send to him. It is devastating for her, because her daddy is her hero, and he does not want to spend time with her. Her birthday was in July and she cried when Jason did not call her to wish her a happy birthday. Iris tried lying to Simone to make her feel better that the phone lines went down and Jason did not forget, but Simone did not believe her.

Simone is at summer camp all this week, and Jason invited us to a party to celebrate receiving a promotion. During the party, Jason told me about how much more money he makes with this promotion and his job title and he asked “You should be proud, old man. (Job Title) and an (elite university) alumni.” I sighed and told Jason that I honestly have not been proud of him as of late. He may have a well-paying job, but he treats his own beautiful daughter as if she doesn’t matter. Simone is his own little girl. She loves him so much, and he doesn’t even seem to care. Nina came back with drinks and Jason told her what I said. Nina told him that she agreed with me and he does not treat Simone right.

Most of the family says that I and Nina were in the wrong to tell Jason I was not proud of him. They said I should know how much that statement hurts at any age because I was never good enough in my own father’s eyes. They said that Jason is probably focusing on stabilizing his career and Simone can move in with them after. They also said Jason’s own promotional party was not the time or place to call him out and I could have just congratulated Jason on working hard and saved the drama for another day. I feel what I said needed to be said. But most of the family is disagreeing with Nina and me. AITA?

As many people have asked, Jason does pay for child support. He believes because he pays child support that his responsibilities have been met.

Jason told us he was attending therapy in the beginning, but we learned later he was being untruthful about it. Simone sees a child psychologist, but she seems to talk to the psychologist more about school and friends rather than Jason.

Many of the comments have also suggested that Simone could resemble Sara and cause too many bad memories for Jason. That could be possible, but Simone also does not resemble Sara at all. Simone looks like a young version of Nina with lighter skin and slightly thicker hair. The issue seems to be that Jason does not want to be a parent to Simone.",19463,wpioyj,"NTA.

AITA for going off on my soon-to be Husband for returning my wedding dress?,"Me (f29) and my STBH (m33) are getting married soon. Wedding planning has so far been going alright except for few things he and I argued about like the venue and flower girl. Now we've been arguing about my wedding dress, This might sound clichè but eversince I was young I dreamed of having my own beautiful wedding dress, I can afford it but my STBH thinks it's not okay to waste a couple of thousands on a dress I'm only going to wear once -- yes he might have a point there but for one, this is typical price for wedding dresses. and two, because it's a once in a life time thing then why not make sure it's special?

STBH still wasn't convinced, and suggested I rent a dress instead of buying one. He started saying that I'm being irrisponsible with money and brought up how much money I've already put aside to ""rent a face"" (he means makeup) and wear ""fake"" hair (he means extension) but I have this vision of what I want to...look like, sort of speak, on my wedding and I think that it's my right as a bride. I went ahead and purchased the dress but a day later I found out that it was missing from my closet. I freaked out but he told me he returned it and got the money back. I was shocked I asked him why he did that and he said he thought the dress was ridiculously expensive and that was wasting money and AGAIN suggested I go rent one.

I blew up and went off on him which I've never done before. He literally took few steps back and told me to calm down. I said he had no right, I'm the one paying for the damn dress. He got upset and said that there's no ""I'm paying for it myself"" in marriage and that my attitude is setting the tone for what type of dynamic we'll have in our marriage, he kept on about how I must expect to him to pay for everything while I keep ""my money"" or spend it irresponsibly (but I never tell him how to spend his money) I responded that he gets zero say in how I spend my money whatsoever. he told me that I should grow the f up and stop with the ""dream wedding dress"" clichè then stormed off to call his mom who chewed me out saying she won't let me ruin her son's financial stability with how I deal with money generally. She too urged me to rent a dress or buy cheaper one, way cheaper than the one I picked and move on but I declined.

AITA for not giving 24 hours notice to my daughter's roommates before dropping something off,"I'm new to reddit but my husband advised that I post here and is helping me write this.

I am a mother to a 20-year-old daughter. She is a junior in college and attends school in the same city that we live. My daughter and two of her friends live in a condominium that I own. Her friends pay below-market rent while my daughter does not. The condo was inherited from my parents and it was their intent that I would pass ownership of it to my daughter when she is mature enough to own her own place. My daughter, husband, and I are in agreement that she will take over ownership of the condo when she is out of school and financially independent.

Earlier this week, my daughter mentioned that she had run out of some household supplies and would have to set aside time to go shopping before the end of the week. My daughter's schedule has been especially rough lately, as she has picked up extra shifts at her part time job due to short staffing. Wanting to be helpful, I offered to pick up the supplies for her and drop them off at her place. She accepted.

The next day, I picked up the supplies and took them to the condo. I knew my daughter was in class, so I knocked and, when no one answered, let myself in. The front door opens into the living room. When I entered, I found one of my daughters roommates being intimate with a man on the living room couch. I was obviously mortified, so I left the supplies at the door and left right away. I didn't say anything to my daughter about what happened because I didn't want to put her in an uncomfortable position but I did let her know that I had dropped off the supplies.

On Friday, I got an angry email from the roommate's parents. I'm not sure exactly what they were told but their email lambasted me for invading their daughter's privacy. They said that what I did was wrong because I'm their daughter's landlord and I entered the condo without giving 24-hours notice. They're threatening to take legal action if I do it again. I am vaguely familiar with this requirement, but didn't think it was applicable here. Was I the asshole in this situation? I feel bad about what happened but I also don't feel like I was out of line.

Edit: My daughter was aware that I was coming to drop off the supplies and asked that I leave them in the kitchen, which is adjacent to the living room.

Edit 2: I am not asking for judgment on whether I violated the law. I checked in with a friend who is a lawyer and he thinks that, because my daughter gave explicit permission to enter the home and drop off the supplies, I'm in the clear. I am asking whether I was the asshole for doing so.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

I called and texted my daughter asking to discuss the situation. She can't speak to me right now because her roommates are fighting and she's mediating, but she is aware of the situation and sent me a quick explanation. My daughter had notified all the roommates that I was coming over but Roommate 1 apparently forgot. The man she was with was Roommate 2's boyfriend. She freaked out and contacted her parents because she was scared I would spill the beans. I still don't know exactly what she told her parents but I assume it wasn't the full story. I have never met Roommate 2's boyfriend, so I didn't know it was him. Roommate 1 and Roommate 2 are fighting now and, needless to say, Roommate 1 will be moving out.

I will be writing a more comprehensive, formal lease for Roommate 2  for both my protection and hers but, in all honesty, Roommate 2 is wonderful and I do not anticipate that there will be any problems.",19433,yuje53,"NTA, my mom is my landlord as well and in this scenario, the only person I’d be pissed at is roomie for fucking in the common areas.

AITA for leaving my husband for a Christmas trip to Hawaii with our kids,"Every year my family spends our Christmas in Hawaii. We’ve done it every year since I can remember and it’s a fun family tradition for me. After me and my husband had kids we had to reorganize our family Christmas plans because his parents wanted to see our kids for Christmas, so we decided that we would celebrate Christmas with his parents on New Years and go to Hawaii for actual Christmas.

This is the system that worked for us until last year. Last year his dad passed away around this time of the year and it hit him and his mom hard. For obvious reasons we didn’t go to Hawaii.

This year we planned out what we’d do for the holidays early. We’d do Thanksgiving with his mom, and we’d do Christmas in Hawaii since me and the kids missed out last year. Things were going well until right before our flight. About a week out, he said he was unsure. He said that he thinks it might be better that we stay. He said he really wanted to spend Christmas with his family and felt like his mom really needed it.

I was unhappy about this, we made a plan, we saw her last month, and we already had my dad buy our tickets and hotel, so it would be incredibly unfair to me, him and our kids for us to not go just for his mom, who we’d see a few days after we got back anyways.

We got into an argument about it and proposed that me and the kids can go to Hawaii and he can stay there with his mom. He decided to do this but he was very clearly upset that I wasn’t going to forgo my family’s Christmas tradition and seeing my family just for his mom.

So now I’m in Hawaii watching and rangling the kids by myself. While he’s home alone. He have said texted me or responded to me much. When I call him he only talks for about 3 minutes before wanting to get off the phone with me and talk to the girls.

AITA for not letting my daughter use her college fund for a wedding or house?,"Backstory: I (43f) have 4 kids. El (22f) Katie (17f) cam(15m) isla (5f) and I'm also currently pregnant.

Me and my husband (50m) started adding to college funds every month for each of our kids pretty much as soon as we found out we were pregnant. I won't say the exact amount but my husband has an excellent job so it's more than most.

We never told our kids because it just didn't feel necessary.

El got pregnant when she was 16 and ended up dropping out of school. I was very disappointed but I understood. However I was under the impression she would return later, but she has no plans to.

The dad stuck around and now they have 1 more kid (3) and one on the way. They are engaged but don't plan to marry until they can afford it.

They were doing okay financially for a while but due to the market right now they've been struggling because El can't get a job since she doesn't have a diploma so we've been loaning them money.

Katie is a senior and  just got accepted into college, we've been setting everything up and obviously she knows about the fund now.

Katie and El were talking and she was telling El about the school and El asked how she was planning on paying for it, Katie responded ""my college fund"" I was in the room while they were talking and this made me panic. We had just planned on splitting it between the remaining four since we knew they were going to college.

El asked me if they all had one and I wasn't going to lie, so I said yes. She got really excited and went to call her fiance and tell him the good news. I was confused and told her she couldn't have the money, she asked why and I said it's for school. She got upset and left my house. 

The next day I get a call from El, she was crying and begging me to let her have the funds so she could finally afford a down payment and maybe even a wedding. I told her she could have the money if she went back to school and whatever money was keft over she could use for whatever she wanted. She got super mad and started yelling at me and saying it's her money. I told her that it was MY money and those  were my conditions and she hung up.

Now we are being harassed by her fiances family (they aren't as fortunate as us) calling us assholes and a lot of other names. Saying it's all gonna go to waste if she doesn't use it, were setting her up for failure, etc..

Now I'm wondering if I'm the asshole because my dad said we should give her the money as we ""saved it for her after all"".

So am I the asshole?


UPDATE: ( I think this is within the rules, please correct me if it's not)
My daughter came over on Thursday and we were able to work things out. We both apologized and had a long discussion. She will be getting her GED and will be going to a trade school in exchange for me giving her whatever money is left over. She hasn't decided which one yet, but it will probably be cosmetology.

AITA for publicly humiliating my mom?,"I was contemplating whether to post this for a while but now I’m curious.

I’m 24f and I have a half brother Ethan who is 17.

When I was 16, our mother married her new husband and has 2 kids with him. Ethan’s father isn’t in his life so he stays with them full time but I spend more time with my dad and his family because I just get along with them better. I love my mom but she can be a bit much sometimes so I rarely see her. Ethan and I text occasionally. 

It was my mother’s birthday a few days ago and while I was visiting I noticed that Ethan and my newborn half sibling weren’t around. I asked my mom where they were at and she said that she asked Ethan to check up on the baby while she took a break. We were all in the backyard btw which is MASSIVE. 

But yeah ok no biggie.

But some time later I still couldn’t find him and so I went to Ethan’s room and he’s rocking the baby while she’s inconsolable and he’s crying too because she won’t stop. There were diapers and baby formula everywhere and he was saying that he tried everything but she won’t stop. 

I managed to calm them both down somehow and asked Ethan why he didn’t just call someone for help. He said that he’s usually really good at this and mom makes him take care of the baby all the time so he just panicked. He then told me that he helped out with our other half sister when she was a baby as well and still takes care of her.

I was really upset. I mean yes there’s nothing wrong with needing a break but Ethan’s a 17 year old boy. He’s not a father or a mother but apparently he takes care of our half siblings more than our mom and step dad? 

I walked up to my mom while she was talking to a group of people and basically told her that I can’t believe she’s dumping all her responsibilities on Ethan. She knew what I was talking about immediately and told me to relax and that Ethan likes it blah blah. I told her that while she was out here having a blast her son was sobbing in his room because of how overwhelmed he was. She got really red and everyone went silent which was awkward but yeah. 

I later got a call from my mom saying that she respects my opinions on this situation but that I didn’t need to publicly humiliate her in front of her friends and coworkers. Apparently, her boss was there too and he’s being very cold to her. Idk I just can’t get Ethan out of my head. AITA?",19402,x4b13z,"NTA - good on your for defending your half-brother.

My wife isn't invited to the wedding. I have been divorced for 15 years and married to my wife now for 8 years. My daughter never really liked my wife,  they didn't get along well. My other two kids love her. 

I called my daughter and asked her why my wife isn't invited. She said that it's her wedding day and she only wants to invite her real family. I said ""well did you invite Mom's BF?"" and she said yes. I said ""well okay, then you should invite My Wife too, or I am not paying for the wedding"". 

She declined and said she isn't inviting my wife. I told her I'll cancel the payments then, and she didn't believe me. I cancelled them and my daughter is now super pissed at me, as is my ex wife.

AITA for making inappropriate noises when my mother inlaw called my husband's phone at 2AM?,"
My husband Kevin and I got married months ago, eversince we moved away, his moms started calling more often. She had a mental breakdown when she heard we were moving, she begged we stay near cause she ""needs him"" though her 2 older sons are there. 

Anyhow, she'd call at random times then started calling in the middle of the night, specifically at 2AM. I thought that was so weird but she said she wanted to hear Kevin's voice but was too busy to call during the day. Kevin responds to her call every time saying he's worried there might be an emergency...it's exhausting, and completely ruins our alone time. I asked her to call at like 10 but no, she kept calling at 2. Kevin said he can't bring himself to ignore her calls and asked that I be patient.


Last night, I decided I wasn't having it, I waited til Kevin was asleep and put his phone on vibrate and waited for her to call, 2 O'clock rolls around and the phone starts vibrating on the nightstand. I stretch my arm to answer and then I start making s&x noises from the bed, I'm talking full on moaning and then some dirty talk then moaning, few seconds in and she ends the call. Kevin wakes up and asks if I was alright I tell him it's just the fever then he goes back to sleep.

I told him to just tell her I was behind this and he said ""Oh don't worry about it, I will"" then demanded I apologize to her immedietly but her shaming texts made me refuse.

AITA for telling my sister that her husband would take her more seriously if she didn't dressed like she did?,"My (26F) sister Anna (24F) married my friend Lance (27M), he was the cool guy in our friend group, handsome, misterious, smart, quiet. I don't know how he ended up with my sister, she's the total opposite, loud, funny, outgoing. She's beautiful tho, really beautiful, and when they got together everyone said how good they looked.

Anna seemed to be really in love with him ALL THE TIME, she used to say how dreamy he was, how good he treated her and how spoiled she felt, but Lance was always so stern and quiet, she would revolve around him at family gatherings but he wouldn't engage that much with everyone but me and her. I was surprised when he asked her to marry him.My sister never took the wifey role too serious, she had a non-traditional wedding and Lance when along with it, she made a bunch of rules that he agreed to and then they moved to his house. Anna banned house utensils from the wedding gift list, she doesn't work, didn't finish her studies and they don't plan on having kids.

My sister is pretty much only into her looks (And I didn't think Lance cared for that before), she's always on Snapchat or Instagram, I thought that after getting married she would dress more appropriate since she used to use crop tops, blouses, dresses and shirts that showed her cleavage, short skirts or tight jean, but she says that Lance likes her just fine.

Last week was my dad's birthday and we had a party, my sister and Lance came and she was wearing a pretty short floral dress, nonetheless most of the men were looking at her including my dad's friends, Lance was as stoic as always and my sister came to my mom and I and saying that she didn't know why he was so quiet since he's not like that (HE is like that wtf) so I told her that if she didn't dressed like that he might take her more seriously.

She got sad and sat quietly the rest of the night and I didn't think much of that, but a few days ago Lance texted me and said that he would appreciate if I didn't comment on her wife's way of dressing again. ??? Did I miss something?

AITA for making my wife think our son was missing?,"My wife has a horrible habit that I discovered 2 months ago. We were ordering lunch on the Subway app and I told her to pick the location that has a drive thru that way we don’t have to go inside and take the baby out of the car just to clip him back in a few minutes later.  She told me it’s not a big deal to leave the baby in the car to run in and pick it up really fast.  I had no idea she ever did this.  I told her I was not comfortable with her leaving him in the car alone even for a minute and she told me she’s been doing it since he was born and it’s always been fine.  She told me she does it to pick up food, run into the post office or pharmacy, etc.  I was floored.  We don’t live in a horrible area but it’s also not super safe either.  I told her to not ever do this again.

She told me she never stopped to think about the potential dangers and that she would stop doing it.

It was parked in a spot up front and not a pump, so I figured she stopped in to grab some snacks which we like to do.

The car wasn’t even locked.  

I don’t know what came over me, but in that moment I decided to take my son and put him into my car (he’s got a car seat in there too).  I then drove to the other side of the gas station parking lot and waited for my wife to come out.  It took SIX MINUTES for her to appear.  When she saw that he was gone she looked stunned for a second and then started to frantically look around and cry.  I didn’t let it go on long, after this I saw her pull her phone out, presumably to call 911, and that’s when I pulled my car around to her.  I parked, got out and walked around to my sons door, and opened it to show him to her.

She looked extremely relieved but that quickly turned to anger with her asking me why I took him and did that to her.  I told her she needed to learn her lesson and she promised to stop leaving him in the car, and that she was extremely irresponsible.  It was so easy for me to pull up and take him.  No one else at the gas station even noticed!  So if he really was taken there would’ve been no help and it would’ve been 100% her fault.  

She proceeded to call me cruel and psychotic and tried taking our son out of my car into hers.  I said no and that I would be driving him home, and I left.  She came home not much later but ignored me the rest of the day.

She acknowledged me today saying she wanted an apology and I said absolutely not and she’s the one who should be saying sorry.  She’s been guilt tripping me the rest of the day saying no mother should experience the fear I put her through.  Did I go too far?  AITA?

EDIT: please check comments for an update, I can’t add it here due to character limit.",19322,sv96yr,"Update on this situation: I sat my wife down this morning and did apologize for the way I went about things but said I was not sorry for caring about our son’s safety and in the moment felt like she needed a huge wake up call.  She apologized for lying and continuing to do this unsafe practice.

I asked her why she seems so casual about what she is doing, most parents I know (myself included) are on the paranoid side when it comes to their kids, and she has been doing this for so long without seeing an issue.  I asked if she thinks she’s dealing with some kind of postpartum mental health issue as I don’t consider this normal, she broke down crying saying she doesn’t know what’s wrong with her.  

She has agreed to seek counseling and until there is a major change/improvement I will be running all errands with my son or we will be doing them together, but I told her I cannot trust her anymore to take him places by herself.",4626,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sv96yr/aita_for_making_my_wife_think_our_son_was_missing/
AITA for calling every morning?,"My son is a 20 month old toddler, my wife is a stay-at-home mom, I work six days a week and I'm usually gone for twelve hours a day.

I always check in on my son remotely via our nursery cam app and he's always awake in the mornings around 8:00. He has a great sleep routine. Our ""wind down"" time starts at the same time every evening, we clean up toys, read a book, when I lay him down he's still awake, he falls asleep on his own and sleeps all night for at least twelve hours.

It's usually after 9:00 before I have a chance to check the camera, this morning when I checked it was 9:12 and some mornings are closer to 10:00. Every time I look though, he's awake in the dark and standing in his crib just waiting. When I see this, I immediately turn on the brightest night light the camera has and speak to him through the camera app. I always tell him good morning and I love him and he usually laughs and says ""Dada"". Then I leave the app and call my wife to wake her up.

I usually have to call three to four times and when she finally answers, it's obvious that she just woke up and only because I called. I tell her that our son is awake waiting for her and that she needs to get up to start their day.

This morning while on the phone, I asked her if she was going to get him after using the bathroom and she said no, she was going to the kitchen to prepare their breakfast and THEN she'd get him. I asked her to get him after the bathroom so he could go to the kitchen with her and she flipped out. She told me it pisses her off that I call EVERY morning to tell her how to be a mom and that she has a routine. I retorted with ""well, your routine sucks because he's been awake for an hour and you'd still be asleep if I hadn't called"".

I just bothers me that he has to wait so long. He needs a diaper change, he's probably thirsty, hungry and just wants to play.

Am I wrong though? Do I need to stop? Please be completely honest with your answers. Thanks!



**EDIT #1**



I was banned from commenting within the first hour because I violated a rule in a comment and that's why I wasn't responding to anyone. I'm a fairly new Reddit user in terms of posting - I normally read a lot and that's all - and because of this, I had no clue that a temporary comment ban didn't affect my ability to edit the post. I would have edited the post much sooner had I known I was able to regardless of the comment ban.

There are so many things that need to be addressed about this post and the most important one is about my wife. I love her more than anyone on Reddit thinks I do. She is an amazing woman and a wonderful mother. I absolutely DO NOT think she is an incompetent parent nor do I think she neglects my son. None of the information I provided was ever supposed to convey that negative message about her.

My whole issue was: ""he's awake, he's been awake, why are you still asleep?"" - that's all, and she agreed she stays up too late plus has alarms set now.

I showed my wife how this post EXPLODED and she COULD NOT believe the kind of attention it got. She is very much in love with me and does not agree that I am controlling nor does she believe that I am micromanaging her daily life.

Also, because so many people believe that I intentionally left out the medical issues she has, I'll list them here:

- postpartum depression
- low vitamin B-12
- chronic fatigue

Now, let me explain why I didn't list them originally.

Her low vitamin B-12 is not a deficiency, her level is just lower than what is considered ""best"" for her age; this is according to recent bloodwork that I recommended. The results state that any number between 100 pg/mL and 914 pg/mL is ""within normal range"", and her level is 253 pg/mL. The doctor suggested sublingual B-12 1000mcg daily to raise the level a little, but stated that apart from that, she could not find a reason for the chronic fatigue. Because of these results, and especially after purchasing the supplements, in my mind, the B-12 is not a problem. Also, the bloodwork confirmed that everything else was normal.

The postpartum depression is actively being monitored and treated by a professional. My wife literally goes to a psychiatrist, or psychologist (I can't remember their exact title) multiple times a year and we pay for medication every 30 days. She initially tried depression medication, followed the regimen religiously and not much changed for her. This was addressed in a following appointment and a new medication was prescribed. Her current medication is normally used to treat ADHD or narcolepsy and the doctor believed it would alleviate some of her tiredness and release more dopamine thus providing more energy in her daily life. This does seem to be true and she seems to be happy with the medicine.

The chronic fatigue is a result of her own poor scheduling and personal health. She has agreed that she spends too much time sitting and using the phone. She naps when our son naps and has trouble falling asleep at a normal bedtime hour due to this daytime sleep. We always go to bed together and he's told me multiple times that she moved to the living room after I fell asleep because she couldn't sleep and was bored just lying there. Then, midnight or later comes, she's finally drowsy and decides to sleep. However, the overstimulation from social media and phone usage makes it difficult for her brain to reach REM sleep normally. So she falls asleep at 12:00, our son wakes up at 8:00, eight hours have passed and she still feels tired and not at all rested.

I do know and have known about her condition. We have agreed to disagree about the cause of her sleeping problems. In her mind she has chronic fatigue because of insomnia and it's a vicious cycle. In my mind she stays up too late on the phone and doesn't get the sleep her body needs.

Whether the internet thinks she is a bad mother, negligent, lazy or abusive is not important. I know and love the woman I married, I do feel comfortable leaving her with our kid and she does an amazing job with him. In a few comments I stated that she was lazy and didn't do much at home. I won't deny those statements, but in the moment I was still aggravated because the argument over the phone had just recently ended. I don't truly think she's lazy because I've seen what she can do; I just think she's unmotivated due to a lack of sleep and the same four walls every day.

Finally, I am not spying on her or my son. We only have two cameras in this house and both are in our son's room. One camera provides a wide-angle view of the entire room and the other is positioned directly above his crib. The cameras serve no purpose during the day because I'd barely be able to hear background noise from another room even if I did try to listen in.

My wife is an amazing woman and an amazing mother. My son is just so happy all the time, he's super smart, full of energy and extremely healthy. I will not be hiring a nanny or using a daycare. There is absolutely nothing wrong with what my wife does during the day, I just wish she'd start her day earlier for my little man.

I want to say thank you to everyone who commented on this post and messaged me. My wife and I had a long, in-depth conversation last night after all of the attention this post received and I've shown her everything. There were tears, much more laughs and a lot of things to think about.

I think the most important thing we learned is that so many people are quick to judge and that in itself is a very big problem.



**EDIT #2**



I need to make it clear that my wife does not have narcolepsy. She is not taking medicine for narcolepsy. I said that the medicine she takes now is USUALLY used to treat narcolepsy or ADHD. She also does not have ADHD.

AITA for telling my husband that I'll continue to sleep on bed naked as long as his friend keeps barging in to the room?,"

My f29, husband's m34, best friend (Jacob) m30 moved in with us. He's quiet and doesn't make a mess around the house like BIL used to while he lived with us. However, Jacob has this habit of walking into the bedroom randomly to take stuff from my husband's closet. say a watch or a shirt. He does it more frequently and it's gotten increasingly annoying. I felt like my privacy was being violated because I'm a private person, I'd like to have quiet time reading or mediate. I tried to speak up on the issue but got brushed off by both of them.


Last week, Jacob barged in at 11pm and interrupted my sleep. I was sleep deprived the whole day at work. I got fed up so what I had decided to do is start sleeping on top of the bed full naked whenever I'm in there. Last night, Jacob walked in at 10pm while I was there and when he saw me, he let out a loud ""shiiiiit"" and quickly turned around and rushed out. I started hearing a commotion outside so I got dressed to see what was going on.

I was met with a lot of yelling and scolding and shaming from my husband saying I was out of line to expose ""his brother"" to ""such horrendous sight"". I asked what he meant and he yelled at me to stop acting dumb. I said I felt frusrtrated after my privacy got violated and he went on about how Jacob was only there to grab something which, literally takes seconds. then went on about how I made him uncomfortable while describing my behavior as ""sl@tty"". The argument got heated and he told me to start putting some decent clothes on and act like a lady instead of a sl$t since, it's his room too and he already gave permission. I got mad and told him loudly that I will keep sleeping on bed naked as long as his friend keeps walking inti the room then I walked off.

He didn't stop complaining and complaining saying I'm being ridiculous and even suggested that this was an attempt from me to make Jacob move out.

AITA? We're still arguing about it til this morning.

*edit* He said he didn't call me that word directly but said he was just comparing my behavior to that of a sl&t.",19296,xtn93x,NTA. Why is Jacob moving out not an option here? It is your house too.

AITA for making a post about my daughter’s favorite celebrity being rude to us?,"My daughter and I were recently on vacation. We spent the day in an area that’s known to have a lot of rich/famous people and towards the end of the day we saw one of my daughter’s favorite celebrities (we’ll call her A) walking out of a store. 

My daughter ran to the store but when she got near A, she was stopped by A’s security. They said that A’s there with her daughter for her daughter’s birthday and wants to focus on her daughter. 

My daughter was very upset because she’s been a fan of A for a very long time so she tried again for a picture but was turned away. 

My daughter was crushed so later that night I made a post talking about my experience with A. How she wouldn’t let anyone go near her and her daughter, the fact that her security was rude, and her not being willing to stop for a couple seconds for a picture. I understand it’s her daughter’s birthday but a 1 minute interaction with a fan isn’t going to ruin her day and if it does, that girl needs to learn that the world doesn’t revolve around her. 

The post ended up getting a lot of attention and a lot of people actually said my daughter and I were being entitled for expecting A to interrupt her daughter’s birthday for everyone that wants a picture. 

My husband also saw the post and said he couldn’t believe that I would bash her for trying to spend the day with her daughter. I’m not trying to bash her for spending the day with her daughter but she wouldn’t be where she is without her fans so I think she at least owes it to them to take a picture.

AITA for bringing up my brother's four kids to his fiance and potentially ruining an engagement?,"Okay so I (22F) have an older brother (28) that we'll call Jamie. We've been roommates since I was about 17. In that time, I've seen a lot of girls come and go, even when he was in a relationship with different girls. I'm not a huge fan of his actions or how he treats women in general, but it's his life and he's free to mess it up as much as he wants so I turn a blind eye to it. 

He has four kids. His oldest daughter is 10 and is the only one that he actually pays any child support on, but he rarely sees her. The other two are twin boys (4) that he has with one of my close friends. She didn't take him to court, so I do my best to provide for them if she needs help. His son I don't really know much about. I think he's around 8? He doesn't want kids and doesn't see them but maybe a handful of times around the year and doesn't see his 8 year old son at all. He calls the ones he has ""accidents"" and has said before that he wishes he hadn't had them because he gets irritated when their mothers call him. 

So essentially what happened was 3 years ago, Jamie met a girl named Natalie and they immediately hit it off. She's moved into our apartment and I like her well enough. With his habits, I didn't expect her to last very long, but she surprised us both. Since I planned on moving out in a few months, she'd been talking about renovating my room and all sorts of stuff they could do with the space. She even laughingly said that ""maybe it could be a nursery"". I thought it was a joke and brushed it off. 

Well, a couple weeks ago, while I was out at dinner with my friends, he had decorated the apartment and proposed to her. I congratulated them and didn't have any problems with this until a few nights ago when we were all drinking and talking. Natalie was gushing about her plans for the wedding and her bridesmaids and her new ring. Here's what went wrong. She mentioned how she wanted kids as soon as she could and how she could see my brother being the best dad. 

I started laughing. Basically what I said was: ""He hasn't been the best dad to the four he has now."" 

She asked what I meant and my brother started to freak out. I realized she didn't know and explained how he wasn't raising his kids and how he didn't even want to see them and didn't want kids at all. Apparently he hadn't told her about any of this. My brother was drunk and started yelling so I called a friend and left. I stayed away a day or two and he blew up my phone. I guess he and Natalie are fighting horribly and he blamed me for it. I ruined his engagement and I'm an AH for telling her as it ""should've been his choice to tell her about the kids"". Our parents agree with him and haven't been talking to me. 

Honeslty I feel like I warned her before things got too serious, even if it wasn't deliberate. He should've told her before about them. So AITA here? ",19206,sjziz6,[removed],1063,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sjziz6/aita_for_bringing_up_my_brothers_four_kids_to_his/
AITA for ruining dinner with my joke?,"So my husband and I recently moved back to his hometown and bought a house near his parents. So we decided to host his family for dinner. 

I cooked up a few dishes, including French onion soup. The soup was a hit. His mom asked me for a recipe, and I jokingly said that the secret ingredient is my tears (because onions). His mom stopped eating, stared at me. I tried to ease the tension by explaining that it was a joke, but she didn’t respond. After a few minutes they got up and left.

I knew she was strict about knowing where her food came from, making sure that they’re organic and non-GMO and such. We actually went grocery shopping with her before dinner as reassurance. But I didn’t realize an obvious onion joke would set her off.

AITA for not bathing my friend's child when he stayed overnight?,"I (F 35) agreed to watch my friend's (F 34) child (M 5) overnight when her dad had a medical emergency. She expected that she'd only be there a few hours, but at the hospital, her dad fell into a coma and she asked if it was okay if her son stayed overnight with me. Of course, I said yes.

The next evening when she came to pick him up she was livid that he hadn't been bathed although he was by no means filthy, just a little sweaty, maybe from the upset in his routine.

Here's the thing: Her son is autistic and terrified of showers. I did not have a bathtub at the time and knowing his terror of showers (I'd babysat him before and she had left directions to fill the tub without him in the bathroom because even that triggers him) I opted to clean him with baby wipes and a warm washcloth, which he was cooperative with.

She put him in his car seat and then returned to the house to say that I'd messed up his bedtime routine, she couldn't believe I'd send her son home dirty, and she thought I was a better friend than that, and I needed to be more sensitive to the needs of Autistic kids. She posted this rant on her social media once she arrived home.

Now, I thought our time together had gone well- he cried for about fifteen minutes after drop-off, but after, we watched his favorite show, ate a snack, and I put him to bed. In the morning he woke up asking for her, but no tears; breakfast and lunch were eaten, we played some of his sign language games, cuddled with my cat, then I wiped him as clean as I could.

So, AITA? Should I have pressed the shower issue? I admittedly have very limited experience with Autism, he's the only person I know who has been diagnosed and based on her prior instructions I felt I did the best I could in the circumstances.",19197,s9m0h5,NTA and a five year old missing one bath isn’t at all problematic.

AITA for evicting our tenants of 22 years?,"**FINAL UPDATE-**

Update: I’ve had a few comments and messages asking for an update, so here it is. It’s pretty anticlimactic.

Some on here suggested a cash for keys idea. We did talk to a lawyer, and everything with that was above board.

So we talked to our tenants. We offered them cash, to leave, and without any damage. There would be no cash if any damage other than wear and tear (and we were in the home in April) was present. They agreed.

We negotiated with them, came up with a sum that worked for both parties, and a date. They will be Out November 30th. They will use the cash to add to their current savings for a down payment.

But a contract between them and us has been signed.

So rather uneventful.

———————————————-






**Edit4- I sent this to my husband, he told me when he was there in April, installing a new hot water tank, that he told them (well the dad) that we’d likely be giving notice this summer**

**edit 3** it seems 2 months is not enough notice. I have sent them an email giving them an addition 2 months, bringing it up to 4 months notice. 

Our son is 22 years old. When he was born we bought a second home, always with the intention of gifting it to him when he was an adult. It’s a modest home (2 bedroom bungalow, with a developed basement that has an additional room) about 10 minutes from where we live.

When we bought it we listed it for rent, and a lovely couple started renting. They went on to have 6 children. They chose not to move and continue living in the 3 bedroom home with the kids. The dad works, the mom stays home, important to note that we bought this home in 2000. Even with a 15 year mortgage, the mortgage was quite low, and the rent not much more than the mortgage. We’ve only raised the rent 4 times in the 22 years they have lived there and the rent is still well below average for our area- I did look it up, an average rent where we are for a similar house is 2000-2600/month. Our renters have been paying 1300/month.

When they started renting we did talk to them, we did tell them this house was eventually for our son, we never actually expected to have the same renters for 22 years. 

Our son graduated university in June, and has been staying with us since then. But he’s a responsible young man and we decided that Christmas would be a good time to gift him this home. At the beginning of September we talked to our tenants and gave them a 2 month election notice. Figuring we’d have November/December to get the house cleaned an any repairs done. 

Understandably they are not happy. They have been posting all over social media about what bad people we are, kicking them out, how they can’t afford to rent anything big enough for their family. Their oldest kid (19) even found my son on Facebook and sent him a horrible message (he had no idea we were planning to gift this to him)

Their Facebook posts have been shared in our local community groups and everyone is commenting about what “evil landlords” we are. 

AITA for evicting long term tenants so our son can move in?

Edit to add: we did mention gifting the house to our son when he started university. So we told them when they moved in in 2000, and when he started uni in 2018

AITA for calling my fiance selfish for refusing to let my dad walk me down the aisle?,"
My fiance (26m) & I (23f) have been together for over 2 years. I don't have a big family, just my dad and my older sister. My dad has always been a single parent devoting his life for me and my sister and working over 14+ jobs in the past 6 years to provide for us. I love my dad and we have the best relationship anyone could hope for. However, my fiance does not get along with him. They have different opinions on so many things. For example, my fiance one time suggested to my dad to sell the truck he has because it's been sitting there for years. My dad got offended because this is my grandfather's truck and he has no monrg to get it fixed. Another example, my fiance got mad at my dad at a party for talking about his struggle after my mom's death and accused him of collecting symapthy points but dad said that he always talks about it casually.


Their recent disagreement was when my dad refused to give my fiance money to contribute to the wedding. My fiance complained but I said that my dad isn't obligated to pay for the wedding.


Yesterday. my fiance told me to look for ""someone else"" to walk me down the aisle and asked why. He said that my dad refused to help with the wedding and he should be grateful he's still invited. I got upset and argued that for one, my dad refused to contribute because he has no money, he can not offord to pay. And two, just like any bride I want my dad to walk me down the aisle on my wedding day. He threw a fit saying that I was trying to ruin his mood and get him upset on our wedding day but I called him selfish for wabting to take away the moment I always dreamed of (sounds cliché but I'm like that) over his disagreements with dad. It's not fair given the ,e and my dad are on great terms. He yelled at me for calling him selfish although it's our wedding not just mine and said that I clearly don't give a hoot if he's uncomfortable then walked out.

He's fuming and is insisting I'm being innconsiderate and projecting on him when I called him selfish.",19158,xogzb1,"OP, your entire future will be ""my fiancé is mad because the world did not meet his expectations.""

AITA for moving out because I don’t want to help my bf out with the rent?,"My boyfriend(26M) and I(24F) have been together for 3 years. We live in NYC and he makes over $200k/year, while I’m studying for my masters in social work and have no income. Right now I’m doing an unpaid, yearlong internship 3 days/week, as well as classes 2 days/week. It’s rare to get a paid internship in social work, plus internships are mandatory. I spend 12 hours everyday either working, studying, commuting, or in class. My only free days are on weekends so I have no time for a paid job. My mom helps me financially by paying for my metrocard and healthcare expenses, but everything else I rely on loans.

Before I moved in with my boyfriend there was a roach infestation in my apartment so I'd stay over at his place a lot. My lease was ending soon so he asked me if I wanted to live with him. At first I joked with him that his living standards would go down since I can’t afford a nice place, but he insisted on paying the rent until I finish grad school, then we would split the rent based on income. I originally wanted to live in a cheaper place in Queens or Brooklyn, but my boyfriend likes his current place and insisted I move in since he would be the one paying the rent. So I moved into his $5k/month luxury condo in the city this August.

All of a sudden my boyfriend recently started asking me to pay half the rent ($2.5k/month). I was confused because he was the one who wanted to pay the rent in full. Apparently he was talking to his friends and they all think its weird that I don’t pay rent and that I was a gold digger. I let my boyfriend know that I can’t afford $2.5k/month and he said I was “leeching” off of him, so I told him that he should find someone within his social class so he doesn’t have to worry about a gold digger like me leeching off of him. I stayed at my friends place for a few days while figuring out what to do.

I called my mom about my situation and she is willing to help me out but the maximum she can afford for rent is $800. I found some places in Queens within the price range, less than 15 min away from the city and a bus ride away from my school so I went to check them out a couple days ago. I’ve been texting the landlord and my new roommates and I already signed the lease. I told my boyfriend about my new place and he got upset and asked me to stay. He said that he was willing to accept $800/month instead of $2.5k/month if thats all I can afford, but I told him I don’t want him changing his mind again and demanding more money from me in the future.

He lived in this condo alone for several years so it’s not like he can’t afford to live there without my help. I wouldn’t mind splitting rent with him, but I would have to live in a more affordable place outside of Manhattan like I originally wanted.

Apparently some of our “mutual friends” think I’m being unreasonable for moving out instead of talking to him and staying by paying the amount I can afford in rent, and that I shouldn’t have let him pay my portion of the rent.

update: yes i did dump him. i blocked him and his idiot friends on everything. My friends also blocked him since he tried to contact me through them. i'm going to enjoy being single and never relying on a man financially ever again.

update #2: i'm going to make a few clarifications since a lot of you are confused and clearly aren't familiar with NYC.

1. yes, it is possible to find a room for $800 in queens when you have several roommates. but my room is small as shit, has no AC (which obviously isn't an issue now but will be in the summer) and is above a restaurant which means i'll probably have rodent roomies (my current roommate told me that they did have a rat problem in the past but it's supposedly fixed. However, knowing these mutant city rats i know they'll come back), but this is the best i can do for now. I'm not some new, bright eyed transplant who thinks NYC is only the trendy and rich parts of manhattan so i know where to look.
2. In general, NYC landlords have a 40x rent rule. Landlords that accept guarantors follow the 80x rule, but some landlords are more lenient when it comes to students. My landlord's son is also an alumni of the school I'm currently attending and is from the same cultural/ethnic background as me which probably gave me some leverage, along with the fact that my mom meets the 80x requirement. It also took me a week to find my current place.
3. I just started my 2-year MSW program this September. I finished undergrad 2.5 years ago and worked full time before starting my masters degree. So yes, I did have a job and paid my own rent (which was $1,025/month for a roach infested apartment in queens that i shared with a roommate.) I obviously don't have time to work now due to my schedule. My place was not rent stabilized (I'm confused as to how some of you came to this conclusion) it was cheap because it was a shitty place and no one wants to live there.
4. Yes, my ex does make that much money. It's NYC, he's been in the workforce for 5 years and people here make more money than they would in whatever town you're from, especially in his field. It was initially shocking to me that someone with just a bachelors could earn that much while contributing absolutely nothing to society but that's life.

There's a 3,000 character limit so it's hard to include everything. My original post got deleted since i exceeded the limit and i had to delete a lot of information to get this post approved. The last thing i need right now is non NYCers from the rest of bumfuck America trying to have some sort of weird gotcha moment because they think sex and the city and rich transplants on social media is representative of the real NYC.",19151,ycqv7x,"You are absolutely NTA for making sure you have a place to live.

AITA for returning the money my husband took from my family for attending our cookout?,"For context: My f28 husband m33 comes from a wealthy family and he himself has inherited a number of assets from his relatives. One of them is this huge house (where we live right now) with a pool and a huge backyard with lots of features.


We decided to host our first cookout after we got married (7 months ago) and we invited both his and my family. That was on friday, both families came and we had lots of fun then everyone went home later.

I then got a phonecall from mom and she didn't sound okay. She asked wether or not my husband took money from his family before they attended the cookout. I was confused I asked what she was talking about and she told me that my husband charged every single person from my side of family who attended the event $25 dollars. I was utterly shocked and very angry and felt like this has legitimately damaged my relationship with most of my family because, almost all of them came over. not just that, but he got $275 dollars from them.

I was so livid I hung up the phone and confronted him immediately. He told me my family got to ""enjoy"" the space and view and said that I should think of it as a ""resort"" cookout since this house has lots of luxuries. I told him it was a horrible thing for him to do and that what made it worse is the fact the his family didn't pay like mine had to. He laughed then reminded me that his family gave him this house. I demanded he give the money back but he said no and that he won't even give it to me since the house is technically his.

I went and took the money and gave everyone who paid their money back with a sincere apology from me. My husband found out and flipped out at me calling what I did an overstepping and disrespectful. I told him he shouldn't have taken money from my family for being guests at our house, but he corrected me saying it's his house and said that he'd bet my family had never got to attend a cookout at a house like this and that it was just $25 dollars but I disrespected him and went behind his back and took money that wasn't mine.

We stopped talking after this argument and he keeps venting to his mom about me taking ""his"" money that he earned his own way.",19147,vauhtf,Did his personality do a 180 after you got married or something?

AITA for calling my Mother-in-law a “racist b**ch”,"I 32 female (black) am married to my husband 34 male (white) we’ve been married for 6 years. My MIL let’s call her Lisa has always made sly comments about me that I’ve tried to ignore over the years at one point she called my hair “nappy” suggested I relax it which I shut down immediately. At one point she made a comment about an Asian cashiers eyes and justified it by saying “my daughter-in-law is black, how can I be racist” when I was pregnant she kept mentioning how she wanted our daughter to have my husbands blue eyes when my daughter was born she had brown eyes, Lisa did not even try to hide her disappointment, my son was born with hazel eyes and his hair is also tighter than his sister’s she made a sly comment saying “you can’t have the best of everything” insinuating that my daughter was blessed to have lighter skin and looser hair and my son was blessed to have “pretty” eyes. I’ve bought my concerns up with my husband and he just brushed it over and told me that she’s “a product of her time” a week ago my husband and I were holding a party to celebrate our  6 year anniversary and naturally Lisa was invited, she asked if who could invite her friends and I agreed after all if would have been a bit boring for a 56 year old woman to engage in conversations with a bunch of 30 something year olds. Anyways when her friends showed up she introduced me as her “black daughter-in-law” which made me uncomfortable so I pulled her to the side and told her I didn’t want to be addressed as such she shrugged me off and said “you’re my daughter in law and your black, you people are so sensitive” in that moment all the pent of anger I had towards her came flowing out I don’t remember exactly what i said but I remembered calling her a “racist bitch” she walked away from me and went into my kitchen and started to cry naturally everyone went to see what all the commotion was about. she told them I was an “evil woman who was trying to ruin her relationship with her son and grandchildren and told them that I called her a racist bitch” Everyone at the party became very hostile towards me and told me I went too far.

AITA for for saying no to my boss after she asked me to watch her kids this weekend?,"So my (22F) sister is getting married this coming weekend and I will be gone Thursday-Sunday. I’ve had this known that I was going to be gone for 7 months… 7 MONTHS!! I would even remind every month or so just so I knew she knew. 

I nanny two amazing kids who are 6 and 8. This is the first time I have ever asked to have some time off. My boss has always been like “Oh yeah sure! Sounds like a beautiful wedding.” However I got a text 2 hours ago saying she really needed me this weekend and she couldn’t find anyone else. I was pissed but I know how to act calm, since ya know it’s my job to stay happy and calm. I texted her back a quick apology but said I really didn’t want to miss my sisters wedding as she’s my only sibling. 

Well boss woman went off the deep end and said that if I didn’t show up to watch her kids this weekend that I won’t have a job come Monday. I replied with this exactly. 
“______ I’m so sorry that you are having a hard time looking for someone to cover, I can reach out to a few nanny friends I have and see if any of them would like to pick it up. This is a once in a life time moment for my sister and if it means I will lose my job then sadly I will have to accept that. I love this job and your kids and I hope we can work something out. I think it would devastate _____ and _____. But you do what you need and I will accept that.”

She threw a few insults at me and said I’m abandoning her kids. Idk what to do, I don’t want to get a new job because I work so well with these two kiddos. 

My mom told me I was an asshole for so quickly accepting that I might get fired and told me that work just sucks sometimes and you have to suck it up. Mom says I should be an adult and just miss my sisters wedding… idk should I? Am I really that big of an AH for saying no?

Edit: Just to clarify me and my mom don’t have a good relationship, I didn’t ask her for her advice. She was in the room with my sister and I as I was venting to my sister.

AITA for not wanting to invite my autistic sister to my art show?,"I (18f) got into this prestigious art show that I am really excited about. It opens up on Friday and there's going to be a party, but I didn't tell my family because I didn't want my sister (24f) to come.

Long story short, my sister's autistic. She's really smart (she went to an Ivy League School!) but does not do well with social cues. Usually, this leads her to belittling me and being mean. My parents always tell me to get over it, and that since she's autistic, she can't help it. But she doesn't unleash on them the same way that she unleashes on me, so I don't think they really understand. Every time something good happens to me she just kinds of shits on it/me and she never, ever apologizes.

Anyhow, my parents found out about the art show and got mad at me for not telling them. They told me they'll be coming to the opening with my sister (since she's currently living with us). I ended up breaking down and begging them not to bring her. I worked so, so hard for this and since she thinks that my paintings are silly in the first place, I know she's going to try bringing me down in front of my friends and teachers. I asked if they could just wait until after the party and go later (the show will be up for a week) but they said they'd be coming to the party. They also said I was being ableist by wanting to exclude my sister. My sister found out and started screaming at me and calling me an asshole for not letting her share in this moment with me. From my point of view, I just want to have a happy night and celebrate this accomplishment, but idk. Everyone in my family's pissed at me so maybe I am the asshole?

TL;DR: My sister insults me all the time and I didn't invite her to my art show because of it, but my family think I'm an asshole for not doing that.",19123,ubx1ux,"NTA. I may be wrong, but I think your parents have been doing your sister quite a disservice by writing off her being mean to you as a feature of her autism (not to mention ignoring emotional abuse of you). Of course she won't catch social cues easily but it seems like she has capacity to learn some methods to help that. It's not doing her any favors to not keep working on that... she'll end up having more and more conflict in the future with others.",5775,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ubx1ux/aita_for_not_wanting_to_invite_my_autistic_sister/
AITA for making my ex a birthday cake even though his girlfriend told me she had already ordered one?,"I’m an amateur baker and I like to make cakes for people for their birthdays. My ex doesn’t like sweet stuff but our kids like helping me make a cake for him so I normally make one for him anyway for their sakes. 

This year his girlfriend planned a party for him and she told me she had already ordered him a cake so I didn’t need to make one. I told her that was fine but my daughter kept asking me when we would make her dad’s cake and was upset when I said we wouldn’t because she assumed I didn’t like my ex and that’s why I wouldn’t make him one.

Since the cake has always been more for the kids than for my ex, I decided to just make him a small one since it’s not like he eats cake anyway and I don’t want my kids to think I dislike their dad. I told his girlfriend beforehand that I was going to make a small cake and she told me not to and that I couldn’t bring it to the party. I told her I had to bring it to the party as that’s when the kids would give him his gifts. I offered to come early and give it to him before the other guests arrived and then they could put it away and nobody else would know about my cake but she didn’t agree with me and repeatedly told me not to bring it.

I did take it with me in the end and now she keeps complaining to mutual friends that I did it on purpose to ruin the party and calling me weird for making him a cake after I was told not to.

AITA for kicking my husband's friends out of the pool?.,"

I'm a working (sole income earner for the time being) of 2. My husband has been struggling to find a job for 16 montjs (Idk what's up with that) and so I've been solely paying for everything. 

As you know it's summer time, and the kids want to go to the beach every weekend but I'm busy working often times and my husband won't bother take them unless he uses my car which is a no from me because I need it for work. Anyway so I put money towards renovating (and upgrading) our old pool so the kids could use it. Thing is once the pool was ready my husband started inviting his friends to come over and use it for hours. They'd basically taken over preventing the kids from enjoying it. They complained about being denied the pool several times which caused them to get upset. 

So what I did was talk to my husband about it and telling him to limit his friends usage of the pool. He flipped out at me saying it's his house/water too and I can't control what he does/who he brings. I got mad and in return told him that tomorrow the kids get the pool or else I will ban his friends from it completely. He side eyed me and said ""FINE! THEY CAN HAVE THE DAMN POOL TOMORROW!""


Well next day, my daughter calls me crying saying dad brought his friends over and refused to let her and her brother play in the pool. I was L.I.V.I.D I literally left work right then and went home. I saw him and his friends in the pool messing around I just screamed my head off on them telling them to get out. My husband tried to get involved but I told him off and had all of his friends leave. He blew up at me for acting like a lunatic and said that I was being controlling and shamless. I said I already told him to let the kids play in the pool yet he ignored my request. He yelled at me saying just because I paid to fix the pool doesn't mean I own it. He then went back inside and started calling his friends one by one to apologize ""on my behalf"" since he said I was too shamless to do it myself. He then left the house and hasn't been back yet.

edit__few things:

1* I paid for the pool to get renovated/upgraded.

2* he and his friends are always ALWAYS there using it giving me and the kids 0 chance to spend some time in it. 

3* he and his friends trash the pool every single time (dropping foods and drinks) and I end up having to clean it up myself.",19063,vgjpru,"> He then left the house and hasn't been back yet.

AITA for how I reacted when my husband threw away our daughter's kitchen tools that I bought her?,"
My daughter Liz [15] loves cooking, She began discovering new meals after she became vegan (she was a very picky eater in the past). I encourage her to cook her own food but my husband hates it although she still sits at the table with us, but he thinks that her having different food on the table is ""disrespectful"" to the family and she should just be eating what we eat. I thought that was ridiculous and asked him to just let her be. He got more agitated and said that Liz wasn't allowed to use any tool in our kitchen if she decides to cook for herself since he paid for everything the kitchen has. I fought back on his decision but he stood firm. I decided to just go out and buy her all the tools she needed to make her meals. She buys her own groceries so I don't have to worry about that.

Last night I was out and Liz called me crying saying my husband threw away all the tools I got her to prevent her from cooking. I was fuming I went home and started arguing with him telling him those weren't his tools, he argued that Liz was cooking in *his* kitchen and he already didn't *authorize* that. I blew up and went off on him telling him he's ridiculous and was just looking for excuses to prevent Liz from cooking. He yelled that Liz is acting spoiled and that I repeatedly let her disrespect us and table manners by letting her cook her own food instead of being grateful and eating what's already on the table. We fought some more than I went upstairs. he followed me saying I'm avoiding responsibility and that I'm encouraging Liz to become selfish and egotistical instead of appreciating what's infront of her. I refused to talk to him and he said I should apologize for reacting by yelling at him and calling him names.

**EDIT** 

(1 why I let my daughter buy her own groceries? 2 reasons, One is that she uses the money I give her to buy groceries. and Two is that she knows what she needs to cook meals and has more knowledge with vegan products so she shops by herself and sometimes I take her with me if it's a new place.

(2 Is there a cultural factor? We're from latin america and my husband is the sole provider for the family.

AITA for asking my wife 'what the fuck do you want me to do?' after she asked me to feed our son and 'shaming' her for breastfeeding?,"My wife and I (both 30f) have a 4-month-old son. He's the light of our lives. My wife carried him and is the one who feeds him. He is exclusively breastfed. Fine, it's my wife's choice. I suggested pumping so I could also feed him but she says it's uncomfortable and time-consuming so that's not an option.  She also doesn't want to use formulas.

Last night our boy woke up and was crying. I got up and it was clear he was hungry so I woke my wife up. She was very annoyed and groggy and told me to feed him. I told her I can't and that she needs to get up to feed him. It turned into a small argument and I ended up saying 'what the fuck do you want me to do?'. It wasn't a yell or anything, but my tone was definitely annoyed.

After a minute or so, she got up and fed our son but she didn't get back into bed. I tried to get her to come back to bed, but she wouldn't. I woke up the next day and found she'd cooked a whole breakfast but was being super cold to me. I asked if she was ok and she said she was mad at me for waking her up. I asked her what she wanted me to do- our son is only breastfed and she won't pump or use formula. That was the wrong thing to say as she got super mad at me and yelled about how I'm 'shaming' her for her choices. I said I'm not, but she's not making it any easier on either of us.

I asked my friend who has a 2-year-old and she sided with my wife and said breastfeeding isn't a walk in the park and I was wrong.

So, AITA?

EDIT: I am a very involved parent. I take care of our son during the day (wife still feeds him but that's all she does during the day). She doesn't change nappies, bathe him or do any household chores. Don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting her to be busting her ass deep-cleaning the house but I do everything during the day (apart from feeding\_. She's in therapy (not diagnosed with anything), too.

AITA for screaming at my sister at my engagement party,"Update: I did try to make a separate post but it was removed. I've talked to M. I said I was sorry for speaking to her like I did but I stand by what I said. Until she apologises she will not be at the wedding. There was a lot said but nothing has really been resolved. 

Our venue is now only communicating via my fiancé. Unless he talks to them on the phone or goes in to speak to them, nothing will be changed. 

----

Edit: I've had a few DMs asking this but M and I are nearly identical apart from our hair colour (I dyed mine last year) and a scar on my forehead from a car crash that happened last year. If it weren't for the scar and the hair, we would be mirror images of each other.

And yes, I have gone to therapy and spoken about my childhood. It wasn't the original reason for going (the car crash was) but M came up after a few sessions.

Edit 2: Wow, I can't believe the response to this post. Thank you to everyone for the kind words.

I do have to say something as it's come up in comments and in DMs. My family is not the reason I am in therapy (as I said in an older edit). I went because of grief and trauma I went through last year following the car crash. I lost a very close friend (who would have been my other bridesmaid) and had a very difficult time dealing with her loss. I only spoke about M when my therapist found out I am a twin and wondered why I never talked about her before. 

. . . . . . .


Throwaway account. Sorry that this is long but there's a lot to get through. 

I (28f) am getting married in six months to my fiancé (30m). The wedding will be really small (only close family and friends) and we've had a quick engagement just because we've been together for so long (8 years).

Now, I have an identical twin sister M. Despite us being twins, M and I have never been close due to M's (seemingly) pathological need to be better than me at everything. Ever since we were little she has had to be the 'better' twin at everything. If I wanted to do a sport she had to do the sport too. If I showed an interest in a hobby, she had to excel at that hobby. Our parents always made a point of letting us find our own personalities outside of being twins so M's behaviour made it hard growing up. 

It got worse in high school when I started to date. Any boy I showed an interest in, she had to get there first. It didn't matter if she liked him or not. It only stopped when I moved away for university (I got into my first choice. M applied but didn't get the grades). I moved away, found my own personality and met my now fiancé. I've hardly seen M over the past few years except for Christmases and our birthday. 

It all came to a head at my engagement party last month. I invited my family and, unknown to me, my mother had told M what kind of outfit I was wearing. She came in a dress almost exactly like mine but more glamorous. Her hair and makeup had been professionally done and she did look incredible. I tried to ignore it as it was a celebration for me and my fiancé. The night went well until M decided to make a speech. 

Sidenote: M is not a bridesmaid. I'm only having my best friend from university as a bridesmaid. 

The whole speech was about us being twins, doing everything together and how much I'd always tried to be just like M. She joked about boys I'd dated, made a dig at not being a bridesmaid because ""OP is probably worried I'd steal her thunder"" and rounded it off by saying ""If you get tired of her, you know where I am"" to my fiancé. 

I saw red, grabbed her by the arm and dragged her into the hallway. Now I'll admit, I swore a lot while screaming at her and had no idea everyone at the party could hear. I ripped into M and called her a ""psychotic jealous c**t"" wouldn't stand the idea of her sister being happy. I also yelled about how if she hadn't spent our entire lives pretending to be me, she wouldn't be single, unemployed and still living at home. I rounded it off by telling her to f*ck off and not bother coming to my wedding as I didn't want a ""pathetic waste of DNA"" there. Harsh words but I was really mad. 

Since then several family members (including my mother) have called me an AH for embarrassing M at a family party and for bringing up ""sensitive"" subjects such as her unemployment. I'm refusing to back down on her not being there despite nearly my entire family telling me to ""get over myself""

"AITA For being ""whipped"" for my wife enough to get a trip replaced?","I (28m) have 5 kids with my wife (32f). Please don't come after us with how many kids we have.  I work roughly 50 hours a week (10 hour days m-f) and my wife is a SAHM. She does the majority of everything, cleaning, cooking, everything minus the shopping which my wife orders online and I pick up at the store. 

So here's the AITA scenario, my work schedules a work bonding fishing trip from Friday night to Sunday over the summer. I said no way I'm going, for the following reasons, (despite my wife telling me to go and have fun). 

First of all every Saturday I schedule my wife for some type of treat your self appointment and send her on a mini shopping spree/kiddo free morning to do what she wants with one rule no kid shopping. It's about her and her only. 

Second, I'm not leaving my wife for 2 nights and a day for fishing and getting drunk. If I want to go fishing I'll take the 5yr old twins with me to give my wife less to juggle and create some memories

Third, the ladies that work at the office feel excluded because they don't like the fishing trip because they feel excluded. 

Fourth, they call it a stag weekend (despite no one getting married) and I don't trust that phrasing, especially since they are going fishing near a very popular college age vacation spot known for bars and wasted weekend shenanigans. 

So my coworkers have been calling me whipped since I said no, and saying it'll give them a chance to know me better since I don't go out with them on Wednesdays when they go to the bar and have always missed the trip. 

All my coworkers all have wives, kids or significant others so I recommended we do a family campout during the planning meeting (would cost the same amount) and do those blow up things on the lake, boating if you have one, skis ext. and do a cookout kind of deal with family activities with my work renting small cabins for families to use. My regional manager who was at the meeting loved it even more than the fishing trip, gave me a yearly bonus to plan this family event every year instead of my coworker who gets one to plan the fishing trip. 

Now my coworkers are calling me whipped and more bs names and are mad because their wives are happy about my idea (their wives have even emailed me about a mom Saturday morning idea like my wife has and I added it into the plan) and are mad their stag weekend is canceled and quote ""spend a work paid trip babysitting"". 

So reddit AITA for getting a work trip canceled and replaced with a family friendly event?

I find it weird that a workplace would even have such an exclusive fishing trip to begin with. I'd bet the women have been trying to get the trip changed for years but no one would listen to them. It definitely sounds like they felt left out. If the fishing trip is that important to them, they can still go and pay for it themselves. Literally nothing is stopping them from doing so. The fact that they see having to spend a weekend with their kids as ""babysitting"" tells me all I need to know about them.",8520,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ugv8so/aita_for_being_whipped_for_my_wife_enough_to_get/
AITA for refusing to go home when my husband told me to?,"

I'm using a thriwaway just in case.


My husband TOM (33m) and I (27f) have been married for 2 years. 

He has a habit of getting me to leave an event early as soon as he gets bored or sees someone he doesn't like come to the event (like my brother). He doesn't outright say it but pretends to get sick (feel headache or stomache) and force me to go home with  him. Soon as we leave he'd immediately go back to normal and suddenly all the pain and headache go away. He then admitted it's a ""strategy"" to get out of boring/undeisred events. Thing is this has been happening way too often and I keep falling for it. more importantly....it has impacted my relationship with family and friends. I told him many times that he could go home by himself if he doesn't feel comfortable at an event and not trick me into going home with him. he told me that I had to leave with him otherwise people would ask how he could drive while sick. I told him it's not my problem and next time he does this I won't just play along. He smirked at me and we stopped bringing it up.



2 days ago was my sister's 18th birthday. It was obviously a huge event since she's the youngest in the family. Tom first said he wouldn't go then asked me to not go as well because he was ""feeling sick"" sick from what? didn't specify. I said no and gave him the option to stay home but he got dressed last minute and went with me. 

We got there, I went to stay with my parents and saw my sister. about 15 mins later, Tom came up to me saying he was feeling nauseous and told me to go home with him because he was feeling sick. I figured he just got bored and was pretending to be sick to get me to go home with him just cause he didn't like the party. I told him ""No"" and that he needed to stop these games cause this was my sister's birthday. he swore he was sick but I refused to go. he then gave me a nasty stare then at dinner we all sat down to eat but he didn't. he kept staring then started moving in his chair and few minutes later he dropped down and started throwing up near the chair. Everyone got up from their seats and dad went to help him up immediately. I couldn't believe it I just stood there as mom and dad helped him up while he shouted ""SHE KNEW I WAS SICK, I TOLD HER I WAS SICK AND NEEDED TO GO HOME BUT SHE JUST WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME"" everyone heard this and stared at me. I felt guilt, shame, embarrassement...especially with how my dad looked at me to confirm this statement. It was horrible!!!! Dinner was cut short and I had to drive him home.


I got berated by both my family and him and they called me neglectful and with no empathy to refuse to listen when he told me he was sick. He's been upset with me about what happened and refused to even talk except to say it was my fault the party was ruined for everyone. I can't even talk about what my sister thinks of this since this was her party.


Was I really the AH in this situation?",18944,vf4vmt,"NTA.

I’m really sorry you’re married to this guy. I’m concerned your family is siding with him and that instead of Tom being graceful post-puke, he took advantage of the moment to humiliate you in front of family.. which would manipulate you into believing him every time he is “sick.” 

I would explain the scenario to your family, and consider divorce. Think about it and don’t invite him anywhere again. This sounds very intentional. It’s very rare that nausea sneaks up on you. He should have had the opportunity to go to the bathroom, but he instead made a whole perfectly-timed event to embarrass and punish you for setting boundaries.

AITA for refusing to pay for my daughter’s wedding even if I promised to?,"My (39M) daughter (21F) is going to get married this June since she was a little girl I promised to pay for her wedding but something happened two days ago, that made me change my mind.

Background

My ex-wife and I had our daughter at a very young age, (18) we got married, after six years of marriage I could find myself and come out to my wife, she understood and we had a very amicable divorce and split custody, my daughter was always daddy’s girl and always got along well with my partner (38M) of 14 years.

She is planning her wedding (I was paying for it) and let me know a few things she wanted for her special day:

· Since their future in-laws are so conservative and religious, my husband is not allowed to attend the wedding; I said: OK it’s your day.

· My son (2) can’t attend either. No, it’s not going to be a child-free wedding.

· I can’t talk about my “lifestyle” because she doesn’t make her in-laws uncomfortable.

Therefore, I told her that if her in-laws are so important, they should pay for the wedding, she got mad at me and called me a child and said that if I keep on with this “attitude” she’ll ask her FIL to walk her down the aisle, then I said: “fine if my family isn’t welcomed and I’m excluded, I’m not paying for the wedding”, She was furious and said I was being selfish, picking favourites, and not thinking about her at all.

She complains that they can’t afford the wedding since they are both too young and reminded me it was a promise I made. Everyone including her mom is calling me selfish, So AITA here?

UPDATE: My daughter apologised but didn't change her mind, the rules are still set so I decided not to pay at all.

I apologised and hugged my beloved husband and son for being even willing for a second to exclude them, (my husband was even willing to help with 5k) but that's it she doesn't change her mind and already asked her FIL to walk her down the aisle, so I'm gonna take my son and husband to a special family trip.",18933,tnd64k,"100% NTA you said you would pay for your childs wedding with the notion that you were welcomed and included as her father, not a money pit who had to hide who they are or be threatened to not attend and to not have your other children or partners included. Also simply put you do not plan a wedding you cannot afford childhood promise or not. 
Sounds like your daughter needs a reality check on how to not be an AH because no normal person would expect a parent to pay or contribute to their wedding and not have them actively involved. Most times if parents pay they also have a say over the wedding and guest list to a point (like inviting certain relatives god parents etc as parent would be covering cost) if your husband/partner are not invited because your gay and your child is excluded she can pay her own way simple. It's absolutely disrespectful",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tnd64k/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_for_my_daughters_wedding/
AITA for not putting my boyfriends name on my house?,"I really thought this was normal but so many people are telling me I'm a bitch for not doing so that it's starting to mess with my head tbh. 

I recently received a house, my grandmother passed away and left her 2 houses to my sister and I. We sat down and between the 2 of us decided that she should have the bigger house as she is married and has 2 kids and another on the way, while I would move into the smaller 2 bedroom house. My sisters husband has been added to the title of her house as he helped her pay the tax on it. I was able to pay the tax on mine by myself as it was cheaper due to being smaller, because my boyfriend (3 years) didn't contribute financially towards it I didn't think to put him on the title. 

We had a housewarming party last weekend and his parents came up to me towards the end of the night and were going on about how lucky BF and I were to be able to live somewhere like this rent free and it gives us such a head start in life and they were very appreciative that I'd given half the house to my bf. I corrected them that I hadn't and he wasn't on the title but was welcome to live with me and not pay rent so that he had more money to put towards his studies (we are both masters students). They immediately became very judgemental saying that I was being unfair not putting his name on the title, and that clearly I didn't expect the relationship to last, I didn't trust him etc. I say they were being unfair and he wasn't entitled to half of my family's house and then walked away. Now numerous members of his family have messaged me and him saying I'm a bitch and I don't trust him and tell him to watch out because clearly I don't love him etc. 

AITA here?

I've gotten a bunch of messages asked what my bf thinks so I put my response here: I brought it up with him on Monday and he said that he feels like it's a sign I don't trust him. I said that I wouldn't add a man to the title unless we were married and he was paying for half of the rates and stuff. He said that he feels like I'm blackmailing him into getting married. I said I wasn't, I just wouldn't want to make a huge commitment like giving him half my house without some commitment from him and he said to just drop it because ""we're never going to agree so let's just leave it so we don't argue""",18870,vn2r7r,"NTA, and your boyfriend's family are really overstepping here.

AITA for walking out of my sister's birthday party after she announced she was pregnant?,"Growing up, my sister (26) and I (23 F), were not that close. She was my parent's favorite daughter. I have always been a little overweight, I had PCOS, my sister was slim and fit. I always held that resentment towards her, especially when she belittled me with my mom. Not letting me eat more than one serving of dinner or more than one serving of dessert. Telling me that sleeping in was making me gain weight. She always overshadowed my accomplishments. 

My sister married when she was 23 to a wealthy man (28) from our community. We're Indian, her marriage was arranged. They have 3 beautiful kids. I love my niece and nephews more than anything

 I married my husband (26) two years ago and we have been trying for a baby for almost one year. My sister always said that it was because I brought shame to my parents for marrying outside our culture that I couldn't have a baby.  After many negative pregnancy tests, a few months ago, we finally had a positive pregnancy test. Unfortunately, when I was four months, I had a miscarriage. I was devastated. I couldn't believe what was going on. Two months after our tragedy, my family threw my sister a birthday party. There she and her husband announced they were pregnant. My heart did ache, but I was happy for them

As the evening went on, my sister kept making comments like, ""we weren't even trying for a baby"", ""It so funny how we get pregnant so easily"". Just as I thought things couldn't get worse. We were standing with cousins when my sister said ""We didn't even want more kids, I was almost contemplating having an abortion"" She said all that while looking at me. 

I am all for women having abortions, but having my sister use it as a weapon against me. Showing off how fertile she is, how she was contemplating having an abortion after they decided to keep the baby and announce it. That really hurt me. I was so upset and frustrated. My husband noticed the change in my emotions immediately. We said goodbye to my parents and let the party immediately.

 I got many texts from my sister and our cousins calling me jealous and an asshole for walking out on my sister's birthday party, and not being part of their pregnancy celebration. My husband and our friends say that I had all the rights to feel the way I did, but I'm not sure.

AITA for lashing out at my husband for using a picture of my son as his phone's homescreen-wallpaper?,"I got married to my husband 4 months ago, I have a 5 year old son from my previous marriage and my husband adores him.



We were out at the diner last night and I asked my husband for his phone to check payment options for our meal. I unlocked the screen and saw my son's pic set as the homescreen wallpaper. I asked my husband how long it's been there and he said 2 months. I got upset and pointed out that it was not wise of him to use a pic of my son as his homescreen wallpaper for strangers to see.


He said pretty much, almost no one touches his phone so I shouldn't worry about my son's pic seen by strangers. I told him they don't have to touch his phone to see his iphone homescreen. he said I should relax because it's not like he posted it on social media and besides that he only used my son's pic as his homescreen wallpaper to be able to look at him all the time because he misses him when he's at work. I demanded he remove it but he said no. I insisted and an argument ensued to the point where I got up, paid my part of the bill then walked out of the restaurant.


He decided to stay at a hotel because he was ""overwhelmed"" and texted me about how deeply I hurt him and told me he removed the picture entirely from his phone if that would make me happy. then went on to say I overreacted and by the looks of it, he's expecting an apology from ME!! after what happened.

AITA for refusing to let my brother meet my son after what he told me at my husband's funeral?,"
My late husband passed away from a car accident when I was 4 months pregnant. It's been difficult without him but my family did so much to support me. I moved in with them month after.

At the funeral, My older brother asked for a minute to talk then asked me if I really wanted to go through with my pregnancy . I was shocked when I heard this but even more shocked when he suggested that I ""make the right decision, not an emotional decision and reconsider having my son"". he gave many reasons why including the fact how ""single/widowed mom"" are considered too much of ""baggage"" for so many men to date. I lost it on him and kicked him out. that was the last time we saw each other.


My son is now 3 weeks old. Whole family met him and were happy to welcome him. My parents asked if I could let my brother come meet my son even for few hours. I refused but they said I was making a mistake robbing my son of a future loving relationship with his uncle. They asked that I don't let my emotions dictate a decision that might have a lasting impact but I said no.

My extended family got involved and started pushing especially after my brother started insisting saying my husband was a dear friend of his and what I'm doing right now would make my husband upset if he saw it.

AITA For not allowing family to see my daughter until after they explain why she wet herself?,"My daughter is seven and autistic, partially verbal. During high stress situations she goes mute. Anyway, she went to my sisters house all happy on Friday. It was a whole family get together, I had to run snd deliver some packages, I was gone for like half an hour.

Anyway when I got back she was in different clothes and very clearly upset. I asked what happened and my sister told me she wet herself after she couldn't have a chocolate pop.

Now, heres the thing with my girl; she would never wet herself purposefully. She has extreme anxiety surrounding her toileting, to the point of therapy. I dont know what this anxiety is caused by, but its pretty severe. She was clearly very distressed so I just took her home. In the car she broke down sobbing, but was unable to tell me what happened. 

As soon as we got home she took herself upstairs and put a pull up on (pull ups being accessible for her is a recommendation, so she has more control over herself) and has been super cuddly since. She hasnt been using her aav devices or signing at all. She has two therapists and she's due to see them both in the next week to see if they'll be able to help me understand what happened.

Family have been awful. My sister, mainly, who is still claiming that she was being a brat and is doing this all for attention. 

I've since told every family member they will not be seeing her or me until the truth has been told. Which may be overkill, but I dont think my daughter would want to see anyone anyway.

Obviously this has upset a lot of people, especially those who dont know what happened. I'm standing by my statement - if my sister wont tell me off her own back, pressure from other family members may help her along.

I'm slightly concerned I'm being a major ass, though, to those who want to see her and now cant. I'm starting to feel quite bad, despite having explained my situation in full.

Am I the ass here?

AITA for walking out of my sister's wedding after she tried to use me as free childcare?,"Obligatory throwaway/long time lurker disclaimer, because apparently that matters.

A few months ago my (31M) sister (29F) announced that she was going to get married. The planning process took a while but the date and venue were agreed on. Now, my sister has a baby (1M) that just loves to cry. He cries all the time, unless someone takes him outside for fresh air.

So a few days ago the wedding started. Because I was out of town I missed the night before the wedding (basically a get-together period for family members and a big party) but showed up for the ceremony and reception. The second I got there my sister asked me to take the baby outside in order to calm him down. I agreed because the ceremony hadn't started yet, but she asked me to take the baby outside again a while later. When I asked why the baby didn't have a sitter, she said that they spent all the money on the ceremony and parties.

I was kind of annoyed because I wanted to sit in on the ceremony, but just about everyone jumped on me telling me to do my sister a favour and that ""it was her day"". I asked her about when I was expected to take the baby out for fresh air, and she gave me this huge list of times that basically meant I missed out on the important parts. I wouldn't be there for the exchanging of vows, the reception, the aisle walk, the readings, the kiss, etc.

I figured out that in total I would have about 30 minutes actually sitting inside, and the rest was just about the baby. When I pointed this out to her she said someone would videotape it for me but I wasn't convinced. I wanted to watch my sister reach a milestone, and that was what I came for. I told her that someone else could watch the baby for her, and that as her brother I wanted to watch the wedding, and not have to miss her getting married. Again, she told me to ""just do it"".

I was really mad, but tried not to show it on the outside. When I asked about the reception, she told me, ""Oh, you'll have to miss out. \[Baby's name\] needs to be outside and has to be fed.""

That was the final straw, and when my mother was holding the baby I slipped out and just left. The next day I get a call from my sister, and she's screaming about how I ruined her wedding and how the baby wouldn't stop crying. I told her that I left because she treated me like a babysitter instead of a guest/family member, and said that it was her fault if she couldn't get a nanny or ask a friend to do it. Since then I've been nuked with calls from family calling me selfish and telling me that I'm effectively disowned unless I apologise. I see no reason to. AITA?",18811,sjc0fe,NTA. Why couldn’t the rest of the family take turns taking the baby outside?

Words can’t express how much it meant to me getting so much love from my last post. Everyone who supported not just my actions but also acknowledge the hurt. To all the sweet internet moms who commented and DM’d me, y’all know how to make someone feel loved even by total strangers lol. Since so many people wanted an update here it is, it’s a little heavy and for a couple day I needed some time to process it and do some crying. 

They’re splitting up. Heard it first from my grandma then from his wife , or I guess ex? She was legit crying on the phone when she called to tell *me* sorry for putting me in that position. 

Her and my dad had a longer conversation where he told her everything else he did so she made that decision she can’t stay with someone like him. And she wanted me to know how disgusted she is, also to tell me thanks which is something I really needed to hear. 

My dad is who he is yeah but regardless two people splitting their marriage because of what you said is a hard thing not to feel guilty about. 

This lady is heartbroken going through divorce just a few months after getting married and she wanted to make the time to reassure someone else that they made the right choice. Unexpectedly though my dad wanted us to talk yesterday too. My girlfriend again didn’t want me to. 

Trust me I get her point (she’s the one who didn’t want me having dinner with them in the first place), for one thing we didn’t know what he wanted to talk about and what would that do to my mental health. 

It was probably a bad risk to take but I met with him. And yeah I should listen to my girlfriend more when it comes to this stuff… 

First time in my life I think we had a conversation about my mom. How much he loved her, them being happy and excited about having a family. But then she died and he told me even if it’s wrong he can’t ever not blame me because simply, if I hadn’t been born, she’d still be here. He’s only sorry for not completely staying away from me and saying horrible things growing up. 

While he wasn’t saying this to be malicious since he seem sincere it was still an ouch for me. In the end we decided having a relationship with eachother was never gonna happen and said goodbye. He at least apologized for trying to put me in that position. First good thing he ever did was tell me what happened with his wife wasn’t my fault .

Then I just went home and cried.
Had my day to process, a short therapy session and support from both my aunt and girlfriend to get me through. The rest of my family is leaving me alone at least so glad that in the end it was resolved. Not a total happy ending I know but in the end it’s better this way",18784,u30gv5,">he told me even if it’s wrong he can’t ever not blame me because simply, if I hadn’t been born, she’d still be here

your father still has a lot of growing up to do because, based on his flawed logic, it's all his fault for getting her pregnant but that's besides the point.

"AITA for refusing to return my neighbor's ""special"" binoculars unless his wife comes and gets them?","Hi.

I f28 recently moved into a new neighborhood. All my neighbors are lovely. especially my next door neighbor, bless his heart (wink wink). He's married and has 2 kids.


I noticed that he's been looking towards my house for a while. So far I'd caught him doing it twice. He had his binoculars with him and was basically, seemingly looking at my living room. I hate confrontation so what I did was close the curtains and go about my day but it started escalating. The other day he was peeking at my backyard (where I was sitting) from his balcony and his binoculars fell in my backyard. I looked up and he was gone. he knew that I saw him. I took the binoculars and put them inside.


In the evening, he came knocking on my door asking how I was done and whatnot. I rolled my eyes but kept it civil. He then brought up the binoculars and said that they ""must've fell in you backyard earlier today"". I was like ""hmm, wonder how that happened?"" he said something about his kids probably messing with them and asked if I could go get them for him. I said I have them but I won't give them to him unless his wife comes and gets them herself. He looked at me shocked and angry and said that these binoculars are his, and they're special because he has them from when he was in military. and said that his wife has nothing to do with this. I told him that I will give them back once his wife shows up and asks for them, all he has to do is send her over. He threw a fit saying he can't send her because then she'll ""misunderstand"" the situation. I told him there is not misunderstanding if their kids we really the ones using the binoculars and insisted I won't give them back til his wife comes and gets them. We got into an argument but he kept his voice as low as he could then left looking furious.


He's been complaining about me wanting ""to stir drama"" and keeps demanding I return his binoculars back to him and leave his wife out of it. AITA?

AITA for throwing away the food my wife put in my freezer and then putting a padlock on it?,"I (39m) have been married to my wife (32f) for four years. We usually get along just fine.

One of the issues that we've had since our relationship began has been about our freezer. Simply put, my wife stuffs the freezer full of food constantly. There is absolutely zero space for me to put anything in there.

At first, I tried to solve this by buying the fridge with the biggest freezer we could find. I dropped nearly $4 grand on it. She interpreted this as an invitation to buy *more* frozen food so she could play microwave dinner Tetris with the freezer. Every single nook and cranny is stuffed full. She still buys frozen foods and somehow finds a way to fit them in.

The worst part is when I buy a frozen food or freeze something for meal prep, she asks me at least three to four times a day when I'm going to take it out of the freezer. She essentially nags me until I remove the food from the freezer so she can put something she won't be touching for six months in in its place.

Last weekend I finally snapped and bought an inexpensive single door deep freezer. I put it in the basement near the washer/dryer and put a couple of my own things in there--mostly some frozen veggies and a few burritos. I didn't really mention it to my wife because she wasn't home when I brought it in.

When my wife got home later in the day, she went downstairs to do laundry and discovered my freezer. She excitedly ran upstairs to tell me that the upstairs one is full and she can actually fit more food in there now. I responded that under no circumstances is she to touch the freezer because it's mine. Not a single ice cube should be put in there. Then I told her to not even ask (because I knew she'd mention 3-4 times a day that she needs more freezer room). She sulked and tried to debate the issue, but I was able to placate her.

A couple of days later I went down to the basement to get something from my freezer, and there I found it about 70% full of microwave dinners. Upon checking the freezer in the kitchen, I found that it too was still completely fully. I calmly went downstairs with a large garbage bag, threw everything into it, and then tossed it into our trash bin. Then I found a padlock I had lying around and locked it with a chain.

Later that day my wife brought more frozen food to put into the new freezer, but when she got downstairs she noticed the lock and flipped her lid. She told me I was being controlling. When I told her that there's no way she will ever use that freezer again, she threw something like a tantrum and left for her mom's house. She came back later that day and told me that I had 24 hours to unlock the freezer.

Nothing really happened after those 24 hours, but now she's completely ignoring everything I say. I think my actions were justifiable, but was I wrong here?

**Edit**: thanks for the comments everyone.

Something weird here is that people assume I never talked to her about this. We've been married for four years. This has been an ongoing issue. Do you really think I've never brought up my frustrations when I tried to put something in the freezer? Do you really think her 3x a day ""Hey, when are you going to take X out of the freezer"" questions never resulted in any arguments?

I was clear in a comment too. I have suggested that she may want to talk to someone about her issue. She absolutely lost it on me, going as far as to threaten divorce. But people are saying I spent $4,000 on a freezer to avoid a conversation 🙄.

I just want to freeze a couple of fucking microwave burritos without being asked all day when I'm going to eat them. Unless I legitimately drug my wife and carry her limp body into therapy, she's not going. The people here who think that cOmMuNiCaTiON will make every single issue go away have obviously never had a conversation with a person who was incapable of seeing reason.",18763,vshl36,"NTA but the bigger issue is what is behind this. Is this restricted to the freezer or is she controlling and/or a hoarder in general? Either way, she is not being rational. 

Ask her at what point, at how many freezers, would she stop and think that it's okay for you to have your own freezer space that she can't use? How many months of frozen food does she actually need? Can she tell you how long it would take to get through what she already has? What was her thought process when she bought more to put in the new freezer? Was it that she needed the food or that she needed to fill the space? 

You're unlikely to get rational answers to these questions, but asking them might open a space in her mind were she can see, even a little, that she is being irrational and needs to deal with her issues.",3970,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vshl36/aita_for_throwing_away_the_food_my_wife_put_in_my/
AITA for saying I can't attend my sister's child free wedding?,"I'll keep it short

My (25) sister (31), let's say her name's Lisa, is getting married later this year. The wedding is child free.

I'm currently pregnant and at the time of the wedding will have a 5 month baby. I asked Lisa if she could come as well, but Lisa said no. I accepted that and told her I won't be able to attend. I don't feel comfortable leaving my young kid with a sitter and my family would be at the wedding. 

Lisa's pretty pissed off and said I'm trying to act holier-than-thou and punishing her for having a child free wedding. She said she wants me to be there and give a speech as the sister of the bride, but I told her I can't attend if I can't bring my baby. She replied some of her friends have kids and they know a lot of trusted sitters, and she'll give me the numbers, but I've refused. Mom said she could stay home with the baby while I attend a part of the ceremony, and then she'll come (and I'll go home) but Lisa wants our parents to be there the whole time.

I don't know, I'm just looking out for myself and my kid but I might be being an AH?

AITA for calling my girlfriend disgusting and telling her she should be ashamed when she was crying?,"

I’m a 40 year old man and my girlfriend of a year is 38. She has a daughter from a previous partner who is 14 and a freshman in high school. 

I went over there yesterday to find my girlfriend crying. I tried to figure out what was going on and where I can help when she told me she was crying about her daughter and how she is doing in school. 

I love her daughter. She is the sweetest girl ever. I wish my daughters were as well behaved as her. I have to describe her daughter. She has a nice friend group, does not have trouble with bullies, and generally seems very happy. I bet you’re wondering why her mother would be crying if this was the case. 

Her mother/my girlfriend was crying because her daughter is not the popular athlete cheerleader homecoming queen that she was in school. Her daughter marches to the beat of her own drum which I think is the best anyone can hope for. Yes she’s a little bit dorky. But her own mother referred to her as a LOSER during this crying fit. She’s very into anime(her and some friends actually started an anime club at their school), Pokémon and video games. Most of her wardrobe is black t shirts with anime or video game characters on them. Again, she’s a happy kid. She’s got her social circle who all have similar interests. It’s just not the circle her mom wishes she was in. 

Here are some quotes from her during this that turned me red: “I never would have imagined my daughter would be a dweeb” “she needs to grow out of this before college” and my personal favorite “I wouldn’t have been caught dead with kids that look like that” 

I called her disgusting and told her she should be ashamed of herself. I said her daughter is happy and how would she feel to hear her mom crying about her perceived popularity. I told her how lucky she has it that her daughter doesn’t deal with a lot of the issues kids that days have. 

This ends with her being upset with me because instead of consoling her when she was crying, I called her names. I don’t think the crying means anything. She was saying horrible things.",18709,10ayv85,"NTA. Sounds like your girlfriend is still mentally in high school.  And she’s still a mean girl

"AITA for giving my daughter a ""better"" present than my son?","Our son is 22 and our daughter is 26. She bought a house in July. We know that moving into a new home always comes with unexpected costs, right after you've probably depleted most of your funds. So, for Christmas we gave her $4000. Our son we gave a few different gifts totaling somewhere around $800.

Our daughter had to work Christmas, but we did Christmas on the 26th and she stayed with us for the holidays from then until yesterday. Our son still lives with us, and today he told us both that he didn't want to say anything while his sister was here, but his feelings were hurt by the disparity in the value of the gifts. We explained that the gifts we got him were tailored to his interests, but his sister has just passed a big life milestone where money is more important to her right now than sentiment. He said it's still hurtful because it feels like we are more proud of her than him.

My wife got really frustrated when he said that and asked why he would choose the least charitable interpretation of our actions. He said that's just how he felt and he couldn't control it. I said that we didn't give her money because we were more proud, but because we had experience being new homeowners and knowing that something always breaks in that first six months and it's always expensive. He said that was all fine and good, but it still hurt to get a worse present and feel like an afterthought.

My wife asked if he expected us to get him four thousand dollars worth of gifts. He said no, but he expected the gifts between him and his sister to be equal. My wife said that's the same thing, and my son said it isn't. He said we could have given her the monetary equivalent of what we gave him. I told him that it isn't really fair for him to decide how much we spend on someone else's gift. Furthermore, cash is less personal than gifts, so giving her a cash equivalent to what he got would be her getting the ""worse"" gift.

He said we weren't listening to him, just justifying. My wife said we didn't need to justify anything, and he was being entitled. At that point he said he didn't want to talk unless everyone was civil and he went to his room. He skipped lunch (breakfast for him) today, and when he left for work he didn't say goodbye even though I was right by the door.

My wife is irritated, and my son is clearly resenting us. I can't really decide if we're in the wrong here. On the one hand, we should be able to give our money to whoever we want. On the other, I never want to hurt my son's feelings. Were we wrong?",18662,102ge2y,"INFO: When he buys a house, will you give him $4k?

My fiancé Jax (28M) has a younger brother Jacob (23M) who I went to college with. When I was in college I slept around a lot and was pretty known for that. My fiancé knew this and so did his brother. Jacob was a bit of a jokester so he liked to bring it up frequently. At family gatherings, birthdays, holidays, etc. My fiancé and his family often told him to stop when they saw I was uncomfortable with it. Last night it was Jacobs birthday dinner. Me, my fiancé, a lot of his friends, and a few younger family members were there. Jacob started getting more drunk and started cracking unfunny jokes. Some included him saying how he was surprised i never took the chance to sleep with him in college. Being fed up and a little bit drunk I told him i wouldn’t sleep with him if my life depended on it. He got pissed and kept silent. The dinner was awkward for the rest of the time. My fiancé said and some of his family said that I didn’t do anything wrong and they even have been waiting for me to tell him that.

AITA for refusing to buy my step-daughter a car like my daughter's?,"This is a throwaway account for privacy reasons.

I(f38) have a 16 years old daughter. About 7 years ago her dad and I divorced because he found out he was gay.

Him being the only bread winner (and a high earner at that) and me being a housewife, he preferred to let us live in our house (a big one in a gated community) and continued paying all our expenses and giving me spending money to maintain my lifestyle.

2 years later I met my current husband, a year later we married and he moved in with me and my daughter. Him and my ex are great friends, especially since my ex is still very much a part of our life. Also as a wedding gift he gave me his half of the house. Now I own it in full.

My husband has a daughter with his ex, they have shared castody and she lives with us half the time.

The problem is that my ex pays for our daughter to go to a really expensive private school, buys her expensive gifts; and for her birthday he bought her a $60k car. My husband can't afford the same for his daughter.

My daughter and her step-sister do not have the best relationship, mainly because my husband's ex hoped that they would be getting back together, and keeps poisoning her daughter. My daughter used to share her stuff untill her step-sister started ruining them on purpose. That was when my husband made a rule that they can't borrow from each other. I stay out of it since she refuses to see me as a parent and I won't force her.

My husband has a good job, but nothing as close as to what my ex earns, and since we both decided that the house is enough help from my ex, our income is just what he earns. Which in my opinion is more than enough. 

Now my step-daughter's 16th birthday is coming up, she asked for the same car that my ex gave my daughter. We refused of course and said we would buy her a car that fits our budget. She threw a tantrum and threatened my husband that she would never talk with him again if he didn't get her the same car.

He is wavering but I refuse, $60k+ is just under what he makes a year, it will drown us in debt (we are still paying off his student loans and some medical debt he has). But on the other hand he loves his daughter a lot, and I feel partly responsible since she wouldn't have asked for it if my daughter didn't get the car for her birthday.

So AITA?",18636,si5hfh,"NTA, like you said you can't afford it, that is enough reason to not buy it.

AITA for calling my husband insane for missing work just to teach me a lesson because I didn't iron his uniform?,"


Days ago. I (sahm with 3) was in the midst of doing laundry when my husband (breadwinner, works as a pilot) asked if I could iron his uniform before his shift. I didn't say ""yes"" because I was busy (laundry then kids homework then cooking etc..). I said I may not find the time to to do it. He turned around and walked away completely ignoring what I was saying.


An hour later, he came downstairs freaking out asking why I didn't iron his uniform when he asked me to. I told him I was busy and reminded him of how I didn't say yes to his request. He blew up saying that I obviously don't care about him disaplaying ""professionalism"" at work (um..it's just a unifotm? It's not like it was dirty just needed some ironing). He lectured me about how his work is important and although I'm a sahm I still should make his job a priority. He decided to miss his shift as a way to ""teach me a lesson"" and show me how my lack of cooperation and my refusal to help him out could affect the money that keeps coming in. I called him insane for missing the shift, and he got offended and called me a hypocrite for calling him insane and acting all surprised when it was me who caused this situation to happen.


I mean I could have taken some time off doing my chores to iron his uniform, but still thought his reaction was a bit much. AITA? For those asking why he didn't iron the uniform himself? Because I'm the one who usually do the ironing and he said it's ""on the list"" of my house chores list which's true, but I don't give it priority like other chores like homework or laundry.",18633,yc9p1s,INFO: Is your husband secretly three toddlers in a pilot uniform?,1321,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yc9p1s/aita_for_calling_my_husband_insane_for_missing/
"AITA for demanding my husband to pay back the $6,000 dollars he spent on Golf Clubs?","
I'm a nurse and have been working more hours for the past 6 months to be able to save money to fix the ceiling in our house. I've saved up to 8,000 in my account and since my husband hasn't worked since 2020, I'm trying to balance rent and utilities payments.


My husband is a golf enthusiast, and so are his friends. only difference is that all his friends are well off and they can afford expensive golfing gear and trips. They mentioned wanting to go on a golfing trip next week and invited my husband but he initially refused. though, he really wanted to go but complained about how his friends bought fancy golfing gear while all he has is old gear. He asked if I could ""lend"" him $6,000 dollars so he could buy a set of golfing clubs but I refused because $6,000 for a set of clubs is crazy expensive, especially for someone who doesn't work. he got upset and accused me of holding his employment over his head when he couldn't help it.


Anyway, I thought we were over this argument but I had discovered that he had pulled the $6,000 dollars out of my account and purchased the set behind my back. I went home and exploded on him. He swore he'd return the money once he gets back from his trip but, I told him he had no right to take the money and spend it on a set of clubs while the ceiling needs fixing. he said the ceiling doesn't require $6,000 dollars either but the kids room was affected too. I demanded that he return the set or pay me the 6,000 right there and then. He told me I was being unfair to him and that he's feeling stuck because his friends can afford to buy whatever, while he's being yelled at for wanting something for himself for once. I told him to get a job and buy himself whatever, he tried to tell me he'll pay me when he finds a job which is AFTER he gets back from his trip but I refused.

He kept begging me to let him just go on the trip and ""we'll"" figure it out later but I said no. if it wasn't for something as important as the ceiling, I would've maybe waited but he's saying I'm abusive and controlling of his life.

edit -- first of all I'm getting too many comments I'm too overwhelmed to respond. people that are suggesting I return the clubs myself, I cam't because he never brought them to the house, I've never seen them and I don't know where he's hiding them. I suspect his brother's house but I'm on really bad terms with him and can't go to his house. So the argument now is just him pushing to get me to stay quiet til he gets back from the trip but I'm putting my foot down and refusing.",18615,swfq82,"NTA

Update: No longer cooking for my girlfriend.,"Wednesday after I served the plates, my girlfriend said she didn't want pasta and was going to make a salad. I was pretty sure she was going to do this, and it didn't bother me. I waited for her to come back to start eating, and when she sat down I tried to talk to her about her day. She asked if I was trying to make a point. I asked what she meant.

She asked if I cared that she wasn't going to eat what I made. I said that I didn't and would have it for lunch. She got frustrated, focused on her salad and wouldn't engage with me. After dinner, I said we shouldn't make dinner for each other anymore.

She asked why I thought that, and I said it's clear that she gets upset when she makes food for someone and they don't eat it. It would be better for us just to make separate meals so we each know we will get what we want and no one's feelings would be hurt. She said it wasn't okay for me to make a unilateral decision about our relationship. I said that I wasn't, but I didn't want to cook for her anymore or have her cook for me if it was going to make her upset. We kind of went round and round on it, until the conversation petered out. She texted me at work Thursday that she was going to make salmon. I decided that if she tried to cook for me I would just let her so she'd feel like she won one over on me and we'd draw a line under this.

She ended up making salmon only for herself, which I was surprised by, because I was expecting her to try to convince me to have some. I made myself a quick omelette and sat down with her. She asked if I was upset she didn't cook for me, and I said no. Again, she accused me of making a point. She asked if I was going to cook for her Friday, and I said no. She was put out.

Friday she was upset that I made only enough curry for one person and called me greedy.

AITA ripping up my brothers apology letter and screaming at him to just leave me alone we aren’t family,"Context  and a very short version- when I was 17 I was in a relationship with my twin brothers best friend Jake it lasted 8 years till we were all finished collage and my ex had gotten enough money off his extremely religious parents to get a head start in life 
If you don’t know were this is going my brother and Jake were together the whole time and used me as a cover because my feelings didn’t  matter. 
My brother had been out since his teens which is why they came up with the idea to use me so his parents wouldn’t get suspicious. My parents were angry with my brother even cut contract for a year but they all made up and have been pushing since for us to speak since 


I refuse to speak to my brother due to how they dismissed me when everything came out jake literally said “you wouldn’t understand I had no other choice” my brother was worse like I get were Jake was coming from because his parents are nuts but I didn’t deserve to be treated like that 

It’s been 5 years since everything came out I’m currently pregnant with twins with my soon to be husband. My brother and Jake moved back to our home town last year they both have been trying via my family/friends even coworkers to get me to talk 

My mother begged me to sit down like an adult and don’t let the past ruin my sons chance at having a relationship with their uncle . That the hate I have for my only sibling is ruining our family and my mental health 

A few hours ago I stopped by for lunch and to show my parents scan photos guess who was there? The happy couple I was literally in shock for a few minutes than when my brother tried to hug me I pushed him away. I got so worked up I physically couldn’t stop shaking at this my brother and Jake tried to apologise, talk about what happened and beg for a relationship. 

I was in tears and begged to them to leave me alone at the end my brother handed me a letter and said “I really wish things could be different you’re my sister, my twin I do love you and it kills me we don’t have eachother anymore” 

So basically I lost it ripped up the letter screaming that we weren’t family and I just want him to leave me alone. I walked out after that and had my to get a taxi home because I was to upset to drive since than my parents and family members have told me I’m cruel and bitter that I need to stop living in the past and get over it

Hey guys I won’t be replying anymore because I’m very emotional and don’t feel well not due to anyone in this sub you’re all amazing but someone gave my brother my number and with my families no stop calls so I’m gonna turn my phone off for my own sake and before anyone asks my fiancé said in the family group if anyone shows up at our home they’d better hope the cops get their before he answers the door 

I’d like to answer I few questions a lot of people keep asking before I go-

“After 8 years why didn’t you see any signs” -
Basically my brother  and ex were always close and I obviously never thought that they’d do something like that to me like your brother is meant to protect you for the bad guys 

“What kind of relationship did you and jake have”
We lived together for two years and we did EVERYTHING a normal couple does so I hope that clears up a lot of curiosity about our bedroom life 


“Why are you more angry at your brother than jake”
I hate jake and will never forgive him but I did and still do pity his situation with his parents. The reasons I’m more angry at my twin brother should be obvious 

“What do you plan to do with you parents”
As of now I will go no contact till my babies are born and at least 3 months old so I can be in the right head space 

“Are you in therapy” yes it helped me love myself again and trust people I’m in a way better place than I was a few years ago 


“Did what happen give you a negative view on the lgbt+ community” of course not! my brother and Jake hurt me not the whole community and let’s not forget homophobic assholes are the reason this even happened 

“Why is your grammar so bad” I’m sorry about that  I never check my grammar on the internet unless it’s work related plus It’s been an exhausting emotional day",18619,t8vj8c,INFO: Am I reading this correctly?

AITA for laughing at my niece's gift?,"My 12-year old niece is really into arts and crafts, and recently got into crocheting. Before Christmas, she told me that she had a surprise gift for me, and seemed really excited about it. I told her I was really looking forward to it as well, and prepared her gift myself (which was actually art supplies). 


On Christmas when we had our family gathering, she brought me her gift, and was super excited for me to open it. When I opened it, I saw a crocheted animal, but if I'm being honest, it looked REALLY REALLY bad. To give you an idea of what it looked like, imagine something from r/badtaxidermy but in crochet form. I couldn't help but burst out laughing, and I couldn't stop laughing no matter how hard I tried to suppress it, so I had to excuse myself to go to the washroom, where I locked myself for nearly 10 minutes. 

When I came out, my niece was in tears with her parents trying to console her, and I apologized profusely and told her that I really liked her gift, but she kept crying and shouted at me, calling me a liar and that she sucked at art. 

My niece avoided me for the vast majority of the party after that. I tried to make her feel better by displaying her gift on my living room cabinet, but my wife pulled me aside later in the day and told me to take it down after the party because it was in her words, ""really ugly"" and made her uncomfortable.

AITA for being annoyed my MIL ate my dinner?,"Tonight my MIL came over for dinner I made Swedish meatballs in gravy with mashed potato, broccoli and home made bread.

In my house we tend to eat in the lounge room unless it’s a big event so I dish up everyone’s meal. Kids, MIL and husband I take their meals to them and then before serving mine I have to run out to the line and grab some clothes that I hung out earlier. No big deal.

I served up generous portions for everyone way more than I thought they could eat but when I got back from the line my dinner was gone. I asked if anyone knew what had happened to the food on the bench and MIL pipes up and says she wanted some more. She’s piled her bowl FULL of meatballs. Way more than she would ever eat. I’m stunned. I figure oh well. I’ll just grab some fast food a bit later or something because maybe she was super hungry. My bad for not cooking enough. 

But once she’s eaten what she wants, she asks for a container so she can take her extra portion home for dinner the next night.  I’m pretty annoyed at this point and mention that it was meant to be my dinner for that night, not her take away meal for the next night. She says “oh well you can eat it then” and I reply with “no thank you.” And hand her a container. ( I didn’t want to eat her leftovers.)

She leaves and my husband puts the kids to bed. When he comes back in he asks what’s wrong and I tell him that I’m hungry. I cooked the meal and didn’t get to eat any of it and I’m pissed off about it. He agrees MIL was way out of line and messages her that her actions were greedy and selfish. She owes me an apology. 

She replies telling him that I acted like an asshole, I should have cooked more and anticipated that she would take home a portion for the next day, she offered me what she didn’t eat and I didn’t want it. It’s not her fault and that I owe HER an apology for my attitude and snarky comment. She’s also posting on social media about what happened and people are saying that I’m an asshole.. and a rude hostess. 

I should also add I’m currently pregnant and I feel like I can be quite unreasonable at times due to hormones.

LAST EDIT: Please DO NOT send me messages asking for my pics. I am not comfortable with it, so stop.


I recently attended a wedding and now the bride has been accusing me of destroying her big day.


I am 17yrs old, and the wedding it's from my dad's friend daughter. One of her demands was for girls to be modest, simple colour, and makeup. The request was okay to me because it was her event.


The big day came and I wore a satin sage dress, which is beautiful, but still modest, and for the makeup it was just some shimmery eyeshadow with some transparent gloss. During the wedding, the bride's mom suddenly asked to talk to me alone which was weird, since she should've been talking to my dad instead.


She bought me to the bride's dressing room and it was awkward. The bride started to berate me for wearing the dress saying I'm too flashy, I'm stealing her spotlight and gave me the alternative to leave the wedding or wear a black dress who's double my size, and remove my makeup. I refused, because the outfit the bride wanted me to wear would've been too bothersome for me to be pulling the dress all the time plus my parents would be asking about my original dress.


The bride started crying, and I told my parents everything she demanded, than they got angry at her. Because of it, they said they're not going to give any wedding money to her, which lead to a fight between my dad and his friend. Today the bride sent me hateful messages saying I ruined her wedding.

"AITA for canceling dinner and going home over something my boyfriend's dog ""did""?","
Hi.

I'll perface this by saying that I (25f) have been seeing Michael (31m) for a while now. he's a really funny (a bit too sarcastic though) guy and we pretty much get along well. we've been dating for 4 months.


Michael likes the food I cook and he wanted me to come to his house to cook him dinner and also meet his dog for the first time (I only saw him in pictures/videos. he's overprotective of him).


I grabbed all I needed from the store and went over to his house. All went well. I met his dog then we sat down to talk. Suddenly his dog started moving in a funny way. Michael was laughing while looking at me, I felt confused I asked him what the dog was doing and Michael said that the dog was telling him about me. I was like ""ummm okay?"" and then he flatout said that the dog thought I was ""ugly"". This shocked me completely. I looked at Michael and asked if he was serious. He started explaining that his dog is ""like that"" with ""some"" people and that I shouldn't get offended over an ""animal's brhavior"". I felt horrible because I, as a person always struggled with self esteem and am no stranger to the word ""ugly"" my issue wasn't with the dog but with what Michael said. It's like he was indirectly giving HIS opinion about my looks and using his dog as an excuse.

Long story short we had an argument and I ended up canceling dinner and going home. Michael called several times then when I picked up he was lashing out the entire time saying that I overreacted and that I cannot blame him and punish him for something his dog did. He advised me to get rid of the ""toxic"" sensitivity I have and deal with whatever insecurity I have as soon as possible because what happen will set the tone for our relationship and eventually our marriage later.

I did respond later which caused another argument. My sister said I messed things up with my stupidity and that I should've laughed it off but for some reason I wasn't able to.


Did I overeact here?",18573,x4u9ro,"NTA. 4 months relationship, first time in his house, ""his dog"" called you ugly, and he yells at you about your ""future marriage"", RUN, RUN RUN, like the wind.",11873,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x4u9ro/aita_for_canceling_dinner_and_going_home_over/
AITA For how I responded to my mom when she said I wasn't invited to her Wedding?,"I (15F) am my mother's (35F) only daughter she has from her previous marriage. She has three children the rest being (18, 16) boys, this is important to know.

Last week my mom was talking with one of her friends about the color she wanted the bridesmaids dresses to be. My mom had been planning this wedding with her new boyfriend for the past two months or so, they have been engaged for about one year. The wedding is in December and on the day before my birthday, me and my mom have been planning a party for me around the same time she was for the wedding. She insisted it was alright and that her boyfriend and her would go on their honeymoon the next day.

While she was talking I asked her when we were going to look for my dress since she had asked me to be the flower girl. I could see the disappointed look on her face when I asked her which confused me. She responded only a few minutes later and said ""We'll talk about it later."" A few hours later my mom came to me. I thought she was going to talk about the dress situation but instead she sat me down and explained how her new boyfriend thought it'd be a better fit for their three daughters to lead the wedding. 

Whatever, I was cool with that, but it's important to note that my mom had always wanted all girls, I was a girl but I had looked too much like my father which caused a strain in our relationship. My dad explained to me how my mother had postpartum when she had me and just couldn't connect with me because of it. So when she gave birth to my three younger step siblings who all looked like her(triplets 6yo) she was obviously overjoyed, it hurt to see but I was happy for her. My brother's had a similar experience but were significantly better because they looked more like her. I know this is an over dramatic thing to say but sometimes I feel like because my mother didn't feel as connected with me at birth was because I was a letdown right out the gate. 

After she was done I asked her again about the dress because I still didn't have one, again that same disappointed look on her face came before telling me I wasn't invited to the wedding, simply because her boyfriend thought I would upset his family because I was from my mom's previous marriage and he didn't like my dad. She also explained how my birthday isn't happening either due to him wanting to go on their honeymoon right away. It turned into a screaming match with me yelling ""I'm sorry I don't look like you enough for you to love me. I'm sorry you were too conceited for you to get over the fact I look like my dad."" 

I was kicked out by her boyfriend within the same hour because she had cried to him about what I said. All my brothers know what happened and have now refused to go to the wedding which upset her even more, though I don't care about how she feels right now. My brothers had an actual relationship with her and I probably just messed it up by letting my anger get the best of me.

Aita?

Edit: I live with my dad full time, there isn't any custody agreement that I know of. I usually visit my mom on my own free will or when she asks me to come over, so I'm not obligated to go over there. My parents were only married two years prior to having my second brother, divorcing after his birth. They dated after the divorce as a way to make up with each other but it didn't work out but they had me.

Edit: All my brothers are full blood, the girls my mom had are half blood. I said step because I don't consider them to be related to me because I've never been in the room with them for more then five minutes due to my mom not allowing it. My brother's were only invited because her boyfriend actully likes them and his family getting pissed that I'd be there was an excuse to exclude me. I honestly don't care anymore about situation seeing as how my brother's have my back. As for my dad he's been threatening to call CPS but I've talked him out of it because I dont want to get the three girls involved despite there being no relationship.",18571,wdpa3q,You are absolutely NTA.

AITA for telling daughter I'm disappointed in her and won't take her out to a second restaurant?,"My daughters 14&16 are on the same dance team. Their team won a competition on Sunday, and we were all so excited and proud of them. After the competition, my dad suggested we go out to eat and said he would pay for wherever we wanted.

Older daughter, who loves seafood, has been asking for years to go to a restaurant that has unlimited crab legs, but it's a very pricy restaurant, so we've never been able to. She immediately suggested this restaurant. My dad liked the suggestion. My younger daughter suggested we go to her favorite restaurant, a local Mexican restaurant, instead. We've been there many times, as it's much more affordable. Knowing this would be a wasted opportunity, I said older daughter's suggestion made more sense because it was somewhere we'd never been.

Younger daughter complained she wouldn't like anything there, but I assured her the menu would have more than crab legs. We got there, and sure enough, there were many dishes that didn't have seafood, including steak, youngest's favorite. Even though there were dishes without seafood, youngest daughter said she wasn't hungry because the restaurant ""smelled weird."" I ordered her steak anyway.

Younger daughter pouted throughout the meal. She picked at her steak. Older daughter was very happy, and completely absorbed in the crab legs. My mom tried to talk to my younger daughter about the competition, but she wasn't responsive. At the end of the meal, we were all stuffed except for youngest. My dad told everyone to pick a dessert to go, except for youngest because ""she's clearly not hungry.""

I asked my dad to leave her alone, and he did, but she was already upset. When we got home, I tried to talk to her. I explained that this was a rare opportunity and sometimes we need to let someone else have something nice. I told her I could have taken us to the Mexican restaurant this weekend. She said it's not the same, because the restaurant we go to the night of the competition is special, and we went somewhere she didn't like. I pointed out that she didn't know she didn't like it because she didn't try it. She said I know she hates seafood and that the restaurant is known for its seafood, so of course she wouldn't want to go there after a special event.

She was annoyed all Monday and Tuesday but started to mellow on Wednesday. This morning she asked if we are going to the Mexican restaurant tomorrow. I said not this week because of her behavior, but we'll see next week. She wasn't happy. Am I being too hard on her? I think she was very rude to her grandparents, but I know when you're a teenager everything feels like a bigger deal than it is. Should I have just let her behavior slide and taken her to the Mexican restaurant?",18566,wrjbpi,The younger daughter will remember this experience for a very long time. Even though it could have been  handled differently by everyone involved. Your younger daughter is young and in the moment clearly didn't see how she was reacting wasn't the best way to approach the situation. She is just upset she wasn't celebrated equally and that hope of you mentioning the mexican restaurant probaby gave her some sort of happiness so I wouldn't take that away from her. I highly suggest still going to the Mexican restaurant this week or she will forever associate her victory that day as her sister's because she got something special shes wanted for a long time. Making her wait 2 week's to go to a restaurant you guys seem go to quite offten won't be special to her at all and will feel like just another day.,41,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wrjbpi/aita_for_telling_daughter_im_disappointed_in_her/
AITA for expecting my adult daughter to pay back what she owes me?,"My (48M) daughter (21F), Aria, abandoned us (her stepmother, younger half-sister and me) when she was 15 to go live with my enabling ex-wife, Sandra, and her husband.

Until then, we had 50/50 custody, but Sandra has always been less ""strict"" than me. She's always let Aria do what she wants and has never had any home rules. She also buys Aria everything she wants so she will want to live with her. 

Sandra lives in the same town where Aria's highschool was, while I live 25 mins away. So, one of my rules was that if she went to meet up with a friend there (meaning I had to drive her), the next time they met it was her friend's turn to come. If the friend's parents didn't want to drive the kid here, then Aria wasn't allowed to meet them again while she was with me. Everything was fine that way for years. 

The major fallout happened in her last year of highschool (she was 15). She went on a trip to another country with her school and didn't bother to send more than a couple texts when she was away for 5 days. So I decided to ground her, because she had to learn to respect and show some love for her family. She insisted she had sent messages to her mother but we had barely heard from her.  She's never had a lot of friends, but she had been invited her to some popular girl's birthday party. This was my punishment, not going to that party after forgetting about her family.

She got upset and started calling her mother to come pick her up, but it was illegal to get her if it was my week. Plus, she wanted to go to her mother's because she would lift my punishment and let her go to the party. Her mother came by the end of the week and I told Aria that she didn't have to come back if she didn't want to. I waited, but I heard nothing from her again. Her sister kept asking me why she didn't come back, and I didn't know how to explain to her that she didn't love us and that she preferred staying with her mother, her parties and her free-of-rules life.

Over the years we've communicated through lawyers, because Sandra has 0 intentions on helping me get my daughter back (she finally has her to herself). They've been demanding that I pay for child support, even now that she's 21 years old. I have to pay for that and for half of her college expenses (by law). When Aria turned 18, an adult, I started adding up everything I had to pay in an Excel that I send to Sandra when I update it so she knows what damage she is doing to our daughter (I expect Aria to pay her debt, but I gave Sandra the option to pay for her to which she refused). We are now at 18K.

Aria has been trying to get in touch again. I told her that we can't fix the emotional part unless we fix the money part first. She needs to prove to me that she doesn't only care about the money. Sandra says I'm an asshole but I think she is, since she has done nothing but try to take my daughter away and she finally has what she wants. So, AITA?",18555,silt4e,"YTA. 

First:

your daughter was 15, and you've decided to blame her for a decision teenage brain her made. 

Second:

you're required to pay that money by law. if the tables were turned - that is, Aria at yours and not Sandra's - would you have been okay with Sandra paying nothing and you paying everything? Doubt it. 

But, and here's the important part:

> She went on a trip to another country with her school and didn't bother to send more than a couple texts when she was away for 5 days

she was gone for under a week, and sent you a bunch of texts to let you know she was alive and well. She was on holiday with friends and classmates. 

I'm sorry, how much did you expect her to contact you exactly?

My parents, when I go on vacation alone, always ask me to call them daily, and have since I was a minor. And I, every time I go on holiday w/o them, forget to do so. So, they either call me or wait for my call. They get a bit upset when I'm on the phone with them, but never have they held it against me for forgetting to call daily!

Did you even try to call her, or wait for her to text you? Did you initiate the texting at all?

> She needs to prove to me that she doesn't only care about the money

you're doing an amazing job of proving all you care about is the money. 

personally, I has a suspicion the issue w/ her living with you wasn't that her mother was less strict, it's that you were very controlling",6288,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/silt4e/aita_for_expecting_my_adult_daughter_to_pay_back/
AITA for refusing to stop saying my mother kidnapped my son?,"Firstly sorry this is on mobile and throwaway.

I (F32) emigrated to my husband’s (39) home country 5 years ago and we have a beautiful son who is 3. 

My mother (52) has always been controlling and frankly is a typical narcissist. She was dead against my moving and was even more upset when I had my son as a combination of her husband being terminally ill and the pandemic she wasn’t able to meet my son until this week and she has complained bitterly how we “cheated” her out of her special time with her first grandson. 

I wasn’t exactly excited about her coming to visit us but my husband convinced me we should try to let our son have a relationship with her. Well from the moment she arrived she complained - our house is too small, the garden is over looked etc. She complained my son doesn’t speak much english and so she can’t communicate with him. She complained that my son didn’t want to hug her, that he wanted to stay with his paternal grandmother.

My son spilt a drink and she shouted at him. We are taking the gentle approach so I told her not to do that and why and she lost it telling me I have no idea how to raise a kid. I told her she needs to respect my methods or she can leave. She stopped but the whole rest of the day you could tell she was furious.

That night my son was having one of those nights where he just isn’t going to sleep through. My poor husband also had an IBS flare up in the early hours and we realised we had no medication.

When my son settled at around 7:30am I decided to do a quick run to the 24hour pharmacy to get some medication. Leaving son and husband both asleep on the sofa.

I was gone for 20mins but when I came back my mother’s rental car was gone and so was my son while my husband was still asleep. He was as shocked as I was they had gone.

Tried my mother’s mobile but no answer. After 45mins of me becoming increasingly hysterical I called the police who came out very fast and when I explained as above took things seriously.

6hours later my mother pulled back up and started telling the police (most adults know english here) that I had told her she could take my son out for the day, I am currently 6 months pregnant and she said it must be pregnancy brain which the police seemed to accept and acted like the matter was closed since my son was home safely and showing everyone the toys he been bought. 

I told my mother to leave and that I never want to see her again. She started telling family I kicked her out for no reason and she can’t find a hotel and they blew up my phone to which I told them she had kidnapped my son and I am going to pursue this with the police.

Now I am being called an a-hole for saying my son was kidnapped when he was “just taken on a day trip by his loving grandmother” and that a accusation like this could affect my mother’s job as a nurse.

Edit - lots of people saying my husband shouldn’t have pushed for this meeting. You are right but I don’t think he was wrong. He didn’t force me to agree to it, I ultimately had the final say. 

And I get it he is (we are) lucky his parents are amazing so despite knowing my mother isn’t great he didn’t want our son to miss out. We expected some snide comments and awkwardness but were ready to ignore that for our son. Since my mother’s normal weapon of choice is nasty comments he wouldn’t understand so if we kept smiling he wouldn’t know.

I feel grief that my son is going “miss out” on having another grandmother but she made her bed.

Edit 2 (holy s**t is this real life) So she is now trying to change the narrative to “I did not kidnap your son but also if you think your husband could just sleep through an abduction then your marriage is a sham/how could you be so reckless to leave your child with him@

I can not even with this.


Update (of sorts) thank you everyone for the support. It seems maybe I got a bit lost in my translation (emotional and the police spoke native language and very fast with strong accents) the case isn’t exactly dropped. 

They have spoken to my mother and basically told her not to approach the house or they will consider it a threat/harassment and will act while they “continue investigating” but they feel her leaving the country tomorrow is enough of a resolution (apparently she has shown ticket info).

I am still getting a lot of grief from family saying I should understand my mother is struggling after her husband died and so on….this again is making me question my reaction but I can’t forgive this. 

I will reach out relative embassies but I feel like nothing will happen.

AITA For walking out of my friends wedding?,"Okay, so, my friend has been planning her wedding for nearly 2 years and she wanted me to be a bridesmaid. Some things have gone down over the last couple of years, a lot of her friends drifted apart, some wouldn't be able to attend for medical reasons and she fell out with a few. Out of the 9 bridesmaids she had originally planned, only me and 3 other girls were attending. 

Day of wedding was hectic, bride got overwhelmed so myself and the other 3 bridesmaids basically whipped everything into order while she calmed down. Her hair stylist had cancelled so I reached out to a friend of mine and asked her if she could swing by last minute and help out. she did her hair and apparently the bride didn't like it. The bands she was using were coffee coloured, not white (she didn't have white) and the bobby pins didn't match her hair colour and the ribbons weren't curled right. At one point, she said to my friend 'are you an idiot' and I'd heard enough. I understand that it was stressful but there's no need to name call someone who got all of their equipment last second and drove over 20 minutes to an event of someone they didn't even know, as a favour, not even paid work (though I did offer). 

I told bride she had to calm down and she couldn't speak to my friend that way but instead she just ended up yelling at me as well, I told her we were all doing the best we could and she called me pathetic and said it was outrageous that I'd be lecturing her on the most important and stressful day of her life. She said she had half a mind to cut me as a bridesmaid and so I told her I'd save her the trouble and left. 

The aftermath was insane! I had the other 3 bridesmaids calling me to tell me I was an AH and was so selfish I couldn't put up with a little attitude for a few hours because she was stressed. Bride called me crying about how I betrayed her and how horrible of a friend I am, Brides mother (who didn't previously have my phone number) called to tell me how disgusted she was at my attitude and even my boyfriend says I could have sucked it up and it was a total AH move to walk out like that. 

My stance was that high stress or not, I don't feel like she should have been calling my friend names and I don't think she should have called me pathetic. Stress isn't an excuse to talk down to someone in my opinion, especially people who are trying to help, but I could be wrong. 

So I guess, was she acting like the bridezilla I thought she was or AITA?",18543,tgy726,NTA and there’s a reason she started with nine and ended with three,3995,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tgy726/aita_for_walking_out_of_my_friends_wedding/
AITA for taking away my daughters bedroom and giving it to my son?,"I(M32) have a daughter Harper(F14) from a previous relationship. I have full custody and her mom is not involved in her life. 

5 years ago I married my wife Nina(F31) we tried to have a child but couldn't. We went to the doctor and turned out I can't have anymore kids due to some complications. We decided to use an sperm donor and the result was a son, Mark, who was born a few months ago. 

The problems started when Nina got pregnant. Harper wasn't happy about it. When Mark was born things got worse. Before this Harper and I used to spend 2 days a week together, just the 2 of us without my wife but after Mark was born I couldn't do that anymore. I can't just leave my wife alone for 2 days a week with a newborn and Harper has been very angry about it. 

The main problem started 3 days ago. Nina and I decided to make a nursery for Mark instead of having him in our bedroom for multiple reasons. 

Our home has 4 bedrooms, 2 master bedrooms at one side and 2 bedrooms at the other side. One of the master rooms is ours, the other one is Harpers. It was very hard for Nina and I to go to the other side of the home multiple times at night when Mark wakes up so I asked Harper pack her stuff and go to one of the bedrooms so that we could give her room to Mark. At first everything seemed alright. She said ok and went to her room and started packing but less than an hour later my brother showed up at our home, asking for Harper. She had called him and asked him to take her. She came out of her room with her stuff, told me ""you can give it to your son now"" and left with my brother. I told her she could only go for one night but it has been 3 days and she is not back and wont even talk to me. 

Im receiving calls from my family all calling me an AH and other names. 

I dont trust their judgement, they very clearly favor Harper. She was the first grandchild in our family and everyone's favorite also they are trying to accept Mark as my son but I could see that they haven't been able yet so I decided to post here and get some unbiased opinions. AITA?

Edit: Here is the update that I promised 

I realized I've messed up so I went to my brothers home and tried to get Harper back but he didn't even let me see her, saying she doesn't want to see me. 

He said he would only let her go back if: 

1. She wanted to go with me 

2. We move to another home close to their home because they wanted to have Harper close to them to keep an eye on her and make sure we are treating her right, we used to live very close to them but when I got married my wife and family didn't get along so we moved somewhere farther away which made Harper very sad. 

3. Harper will get to choose which bedroom she wants in our new home 

4. I should spend 1 on 1 time with Harper at least one day a week 

Which I accepted. 

This caused a lot of problems since my wife doesn't like some of those conditions. she thinks they are not reasonable. She got angry, took Mark and went to her parents home and is staying there so now I'm also receiving texts from my inlaws calling me an AH. 

Right now Im looking for a new home that is closer to my brother's home 

I called Harper and my brother convinced her to talk to me for once. she was crying the whole time while telling me that she felt like I didn't want her anymore. Hearing her cry like that really broke my heart. I honestly never meant to hurt her. 

After so many apologies and gifts she finally agreed to see me. I will go to my brother's home everyday to spend time with Her. She has also finally agreed to come home with me when I find a new home.",18533,ul107a,"The whole situation is eesh. YTA. You had a child with your new wife and never talked to your daughter and let her know that even though there’s another baby coming in that she’s still a priority. Why can’t you have a day with just her? Because you can’t leave your wife alone with a baby for a whole day? Does your wife spend time with your daughter? 
It seems like your wife is jealous of your daughter. 
As a girl and a daughter this is where the problem lies with giving away her room. First you take away her time alone with you, the time she gets with her dad and can spend time with you and feel like she’s still important. To her it’s like you don’t want to spend time with her and prefer the baby over her. 
Then you give away her room, to her it’ll feel like you’re pushing her aside and you’re going to forget about her in favour of the new baby. 
This is why families who have had only one child for a significant amount of time need validate the child when a new baby comes along and let them know that even though they have a new sibling and there’s going to be a lot of changes that you still love them and nobody could ever replace them and spend time with them so they don’t feel left out, include a daddy/daughter and brother day out. Where you take the baby and daughter for a day and you can go out and get ice cream or go to the park and she can help push the pram.
Not only will your daughter appreciate it but so will your wife.

"AITA for ""siding with a home wrecker?""","Throwaway because I don't want my sister finding this.

My sister ""Annie"" (30'sF) is obsessed with a girl, let's say Jane (20'sF), that her husband cheated on her with in mid 2020. Idk why. Jane's not the first or the last. She was one of the decent ones. Didn't realize he was married,  broke it off when she found out,  and sent the proof of his cheating to his wife. Somehow he spun this as ""she's trying break us up,"" and my sister fell for it. Which is stupid because Jane already blocked them on everything. He's the one that basically stalked her for months after.

Anyway, Annie's been stalking Jane's socials. Any time Jane posts about something bad happening, Annie calls me up to gloat. Any time she posts about anything good that happens, Annie starts crying about how it's not fair. In the last few months Jane apparently got a high paying new job, got engaged, and is pregnant. Annie had a full on meltdown over it.

It's all she ever wants to talk about. She'll call me at least twice a week with this shit, and text me multiple times a day. She doesn't want advice, doesn't want to leave him, just want to vent endlessly. My other sister is also tired of this, but my mom says we need to be gentle because it's hard for Annie. I just want her to stop!

I tried sympathy, tough love, changing the subject, suggested counselling, nothing works. It's nonstop Jane did this and Jane said that. I hit my boiling point this morning when she was going on about how Jane's  fiance would cheat because she's too fat (she's pregnant!) and her baby would be a basterd, etc.. Then she said ""I don't care because I won and she lost. She had him for a week and I have him for a lifetime.""

For some reason that made me snap. I told Annie she ""won"" a slimy serial cheater who likes to creep on barely legal teens, who never supported her through illness or depression, never lifts a finger around the house, sulks about having to ""babysit"" his own kids, constantly makes mean jokes about her, and criticizes her appearance harshly even though he's below average in looks.

I said something like ""Maybe you're obsessed with Jane's life because it's yours is a massive dumpster fire.""

Since then, I had to deactivate my socials because I'm getting nonstop hate from Annie, her friends, and extended family for being cruel. Apparently I have no morals and condone cheating?  None of them are going for the actual cheater though? Just me for pointing out that he's a cheater?

My other sister says that I wasn't wrong, but I was an AH to say it so harshly, and that Annie is a victim too. IDk reddit, am I?

&#x200B;

EDIT: Thanks for all the comments and awards and advice. Sorry I can't reply to everyone. I'll keep suggesting therapy to Annie, and I'll track down Jane's socials and let her know what's up. If anything happens from that  I'll let you know. 

Some people suggested I show this thread to Annie, but I know she'll totally explode if she thinks I shared her private stuff online, even anonymously.  ",18496,s780sl,"NTA.

I have seen her many times,and she always demands people take the next elevator because “she has kids who need to get home.” She has physically shoved into the elevators and forced people out, including my elderly father.

They were screaming and running up and down the aisle; basically making such a scene that the driver asked her to have the kids sit down before they get hurt. Sure enough, one of the kids was spinning around one of the poles and bumped her head as we were going over the train tracks near my place and started screaming. She looked like she was physically okay, no blood, not even a red mark, but she screeched the rest of the ride to the building. 

I was first in the building and hit the elevator button. She came in with her double stroller and her gaggle of children running around her as I stepped into the elevator and held the door for her. She told me that I would have to get out and wait for the next one. I said “excuse me?” She heavy sighed at me and said “my stroller won’t fit in with you in here. Get out and take the next one.” I refused, saying I would make myself as tiny as I could but I was staying in the elevator. She became irate, pointed at her kids and said “do you see what I’m dealing with here?!” I said I understood that it’s overwhelming but I had worked a long day and I needed to get home. I said “in or out, because I’m going now.” She pulled her stroller and kids out, calling me an asshole the entire time. A few people were waiting behind her and got in with me. Two began thanking me for standing up to her because she does this “all the time,” but the other one called me an asshole for not being sympathetic to her situation. 

I don’t think people should have to make constant accommodations for people just because they have kids, especially when they’re rude and demanding. But AITA here?

EDIT: People are concerned with the way that this woman has treated my father. She did not physically touch him. He was in the elevator and she pushed her stroller in, waved her arms and yelled at him to get out several times. Because he’s hearing impaired, he was very confused and only knew that she was yelling at him and he got off the elevator. HAD she put her hands on him, charges would have been filed.",18498,xdrwl5,"So someone called you an A H after they took advantage of being able to get on the elevator bc you stuck up for yourself?

AITA for being the reason my friend’s daughter had to go to the hospital?,"
I know the title sounds horrible but I don’t know how else to put it.

I am not a very busy person. I don’t start college until September and I don’t have a job, so not much to do.

A few weeks ago my friend Alice (22F) came to my door with her daughter Milly (3F) and told me she really needs me. Apparently she had an emergency to attend to and she needed an urgent sitter. She didn’t really ask and just gave me the kid and a bag of toys and books and told me she would be back in a few hours. I have no problem with this, Milly is a very sweet kid and she knows me well enough to be comfortable around me. Still it was a bit unexpected but I was going out to the cinema so I thought I would take her with me and we would walk around a bit and watch something.

Everything went smoothly, we watched a movie together, Milly seemed happy, and I was enjoying my time as well. Then we went to the park and I thought it would be nice to get us some ice cream. We both had vanilla swirls and she seemed to enjoy it for a bit but as soon as we got home she started throwing up and developed what seemed to be a rash. I thought maybe she got a bug or something and called her mom but when she didn’t pick up I took her to the hospital.

Apparently, Milly has a mild allergy to dairy. Alice did not tell me this. I have never seen Alice give her dairy but I thought that was a dietary choice and to be honest, I did not take that much notice to it. I never knew this explicitly. She was safe and nothing bad was going to happen to her but she was obviously very uncomfortable until the antihistamines kicked it. I kept calling Alice and she only picked up a few hours later and as soon as I told her we were at the hospital, she got furious. When she came in she yelled at me telling me I was trying to kill her baby because I had to take care of her on such short notice and I was an idiot for not knowing her child would react like this to ice cream.

I apologised many times, sent them cards and a present for Milly but apparently she has been telling our group of friends that I tried to hurt Milly and I should not be trusted around children. Some of our friends berated me for my lack of attention and told me I would have to carry the responsibility if anything worse had happened to Milly. I tried to explain I didn’t know and nothing worse was going to happen and I did my best to help her but it still became a divisive event.

AITA? Is it really all my fault? I really want what’s best for Milly and I would never do anything to hurt her.",18498,vv31o0,"NTA. It is the responsibility of the allergy sufferer/their guardian to tell you of their allergies. You ain't psychic. Explain the full situation to your friends.

AITA for pressing charges on a former friend for shaving my head in my sleep?,"For context, a relative of what used to be a close friend of mine whom we'll call Gary for this story contracted cancer. I (Mid-20s male) was sympathetic and even contributed $100 to a donation pool for their treatment. But Gary came to me one day and took his hat off to reveal a freshly shaven head. He told me that everyone in his family were doing it in support of his relative, and so were a lot of our mutual friends. Then he asked that I get on the bandwagon.

I told him I didn't want to shave my head because I like my hair. My hair is black, regularly combed and well styled. He said I could just get a wig or something and had actually brought his shaver kit. He was unboxing it when I told him this was not happening. I don't even really know his relative that he's doing this for. So I'm not doing it, end of discussion. He called me an &$$hole and left angry. We didn't speak for a week. Then last Saturday I got invited to a party at another close friend's house. There I found out that Gary had tried the same thing on several other friends, and only a couple of them actually did shave their heads.

Gary wasn't at the party, so I had a blast hanging out, playing video games and listening to rock music. But I had way too much to drink and couldn't drive home. So they said I could just sleep upstairs. I passed out on a bed and it was a blissful sleep till I was shaken awake by another friend who told me Gary had showed up late and they caught him shaving my head while I was passed out. I saw what I looked like in a mirror and wanted to scream like I was in a horror movie. Gary even shaved off one of my eyebrows.

Gary was still there and acting proud of himself saying ""Now you're gonna have to shave off the rest, just like me! LOL!"" I was furious and called the cops. When they got their Gary fully admitted to what he had done to me and even said he was justified. The police didn't seem to think so as this is classified as a form of assault. They asked me if I wanted to press charges and the first words out of my mouth were ""HELL YES!"" Gary cussed me out while they took him away in cuffs. I tried getting my hair restyled into something presentable. But there was no saving it and now I'm bald too.

Now a bunch of Gary's family are telling me to drop the charges because Gary was off his meds and didn't mean to do it. I was like ""WTF?!"" because I never knew he was on meds. But I still refused to drop the charges. It'll take months to grow my hair back the way it was. But all of the calls and messages from Gary's relatives are starting to get to me. Just about everyone else in our friend group has cut Gary out though and say that I'm doing the right thing by not dropping the charges. So now I'm divided.

AITA for pressing charges on a former friend for shaving my head in my sleep?

EDIT: I want to make something clear here. So many people have said things like ""Dude it's just hair!"". But would they all be saying that if I wasn't a man? What if I was some girl that had hair that took years to grow? Would they be saying the same thing? Sure hair grows back. But it takes time. If it was something that grew back fast, people would be less inclined to care. But it's not fast. It takes months. And for some who had long hair, years. That's a lot of time wasted growing.

And I don't plan on pushing for Gary to go to prison. But I don't plan to drop the charges either. His family already bailed him out. And while I didn't know he was on meds, I knew he had quite the temper, and even an entitled attitude at times. One example being a lunch where he wanted us all to combine the check and split it evenly. He got the most expensive thing on the menu. I got a cheeseburger. When we all said ""No"" Gary went off on us for not being good friends. He's always been an ass when he doesn't get his way. And I've only known him for like three years. This incident was the last straw for not just me, but a lot of other mutual friends.

As for the charges. I don't want to send Gary to prison. But I would like him to get some therapy and community service. With the way Gary has acted around me in the past, and what he did to me, I actually wonder how long before he got more violent. I've seen and heard of him getting in fights for less. 

EDIT 2: I've gotten many comments from people saying ""YTA! He has cancer!"". If you actually read what I posted, Gary is not the one with cancer. A relative of his I don't know does. And no, I don't know what kind of cancer. Gary didn't elaborate. He wanted me to shave my head for this person. And when I refused, he left in a tantrum. Then shaved my head while I was passed out drunk at a party. ",18499,sf67dm,"NTA.  The police called it assault because that's what it is.

AITA For Not Paying the Kids that Shoveled my Driveway?,"Hello.

I am one of the many in the midwest hit by the snowpocolypse. I think we got like 14 inches where I live?

I also want to preface this with I don't like kids. I don't hate them, I just don't have any experience with kids and haven't felt the need to produce any of my own (26F).

I work from home and received a knock at my door today. There was a group of like 4 12 yearold ish boys, and they had shoveled my driveway and side walk and were now requesting payment. They expected $15 each.

I was really confused because they never knocked to ask if they *could* shovel my drive way. They just did it without asking and were expecting to be paid.

I was really just dumb struck and kind of said ""I don't have any cash"" and one of them pulled up a smart phone saying they had their mom's venmo account.

Again, me just being extremely confused I started saying that I never agreed to pay them for anything. I was going to shovel my driveway at lunch time. If they had asked, I would have said no.

The kids got really upset, and were like ""You're not going to pay us for our work??"" But again, I didn't ask them to shovel my drive way. They started yelling at me and I just kind of shut my door.

Fast forward a couple of hours, their mom comes and knocks on the door. I open it and she started screaming at me for not paying their kids. Her points were:

- It's only $60 and clearly not going to break me (not wrong)
- They put in the work and should be paid

-Her boys did a nice thing for me
- She was proud of her boys for using their snow day to help people, and I was being really ungrateful and going to make them turn to drugs next time

This is where I started to get kind of mad. I said that I never asked for their services, and it was nice that they shoveled my drive way, but I never agreed to pay them and they really should have asked first.

She insisted I pay them this time and they'll ask in the future. But I don't want to re-enforce bad behavior. Just because they're children and people feel the need to let them get away with whatever, this is just not a cycle I want to perpetuate for these kids. You can't manipulate people into paying you for something they never asked for.

Idk, so far I've refused to pay and I'm now getting torched on NextDoor for being a heartless monster who took advantage of children.

So I'm turning to you, reddit, AITA here? If I am, I'll just pay them I guess. Idk if I'm not seeing the situation clearly because I just don't have any experience with kids.  


Edit to Add:  
A few people don't believe that I did not hear them shoveling. That's a fair thing to be suspicious of. So we did get 14 inches, but my husband and I shoveled yesterday. I'm not sure how much we shoveled vs what was left, but these kids did not shovel 14 inches on their own.  
My home office is in the far back of our house, overlooking the back yard. It's the furthest back you can get and still be inside. And 90% of the time I have headphones in for meetings or music. So I really didn't hear them.  


Other question is my drive way length. It's a 2 car wide driveway, and it's probably 2 cars long. It's pretty standard so I also felt like $60 was outrageous.",18485,sjml8k,"NTA 
You never asked them to do the work? 
And $60 is not a small amount either, especially for kids. 

Also they're essentially trespassing on private property lol. I know they didn't go into your house but it's still your property.

AITA for getting up and walking out of the diner when my boyfriend said that he forgot his credit card?,"

I f32 have been dating my boyfriend m36 for 9 months. He has two little children who love going out to eat. We go out once a week and each time he happens to forget his credit card to make a payment. I'd obviously end up paying since we had the kids with us. but honestly it left me broke this month and the month before.


I just recieved my payment for my 2nd job (part time). We agreed to go out together with the kids and I even sent him a text reminding him to not forget his credit card. He laughed it off.


At the restaurant we had ordered dinner and he let the kids order lots of new stuff on the menu which was $$$. Before we started eating I mentioned his credit card just to make sure he didn't forget it. He looked at me shocked and then started searching his pockets for a while. He then looked at me in a sorry way and said ""Guess I forgot it in the other pair of jeans that I thought I was going to wear"" then asked me to foot the bill ""just this time"". The food was on the table but I didn't even get a bit. I grabbed my stuff and got up. He freaked out asking where I was going. I told him I wouldn't be paying ""this time AGAIN"" and to enjoy his dinner with the kids. Then I walked out.


He called me later and absolutely lost it on me. he said that he couldn't believe I'd walk and leave him and the KIDS in this situation. I said I wasn't going to pay for him and the kids food every single time! it's unfair! he said he forgot, FORGOT (he yelled like that) and that I did not show sympathy for him and the kids and he had to cancel and go home with the kids hungry since he couldn't pay right there and then. We got into an argument and he's been mad at me about it since then saying things like how he needs to take a look at how I'm treating the kids specifically and how I was willing to let them go hungry with my selfishness.

AITA for siding with my boyfriend after he punished my son for asking for money to watch his stepsiblings?,"I f36 have been with my boyfriend m41 for 2 years. He has 3 kids (6,12,4) while I have a 16 year old son.



The other day my 12 yo stepson fell off the stairs and injured his anckle, his dad and I had to get him to the hospital and needed someone to stay with the kids while we were there. My boyfriend told my son to skip workday and stay with and watch his stepbrothers.


When we returned, My son asked my boyfriend to pay him for ""babysitting"" ""his kids"" I admit my son doesn't have the best relationship with his stepdad or stepsiblings but My boyfriend and I were shocked by this. My son explained that he had to skip a workday which cost him to lose money and asked my boyfriend to pay him for his time. My boyfriend scolded him harshly and told him that staying home with his stepbrothers isn't babysitting and he deserves no money for it. plus that skipping one day of work won't do much harm. but my son disagreed and kept arguing with my boyfriend saying his stepbrothers aren't his responsibility. My boyfriend ended up punishing him and taking away all his electronics as well as cancelling his birthday months away. My son fought back talking about how unfair this was and asked me to get involved. I sided with my boyfriend because I really did not appreciate how my son used this family emergency to his advantage and thought he'd get money out of helping family out. My son didn't like where I stood in this conflict and accused me of favoring my stepkids to stay on my boyfriend's good side while ignoring the mistreatment towards him. I cut the argument and he's become silent eversince. even refused to eat with us or sit with us.


AITA for agreeing with my boyfriend to punish my son?",18408,srjkgx,"I once called in from work to look after a neighbor's kid who was home sick that day when the parental units had appointments they couldn't miss (legitimate, and my job wasn't something I couldn't make up for the next day so I was happy to do so).

I like their kid and we didn't really do much all day, I made miso soup for lunch but otherwise chilled and watched fresh prince with the kiddo.

When the first parent came home they started to write out a check and I told him it really wasn't necessary, it had been a ridiculously easy day and I ate their food. He looked at me and said ""You're an hourly employee who had to take a day off work to help us out. Of course we're going to pay you for that.""

That's my story. Your son's story goes like this ""I helped out some guy who means nothing to me personally. And to repay me he stole a day of wages, took away my electronics, and decided I didn't deserve a birthday. And my mom was totally cool with it.""

AITA for not bringing a cake to a wedding I was uninvited from?,"My (ex) best friend got married this Saturday.

AITA for telling my niece my husband and I are not going to her birthday because my husband isn't welcome?,"I have been with my husband for 10 years. We have been married for 5 of those years. He has suffered horrific trauma at the hands of his dad. His parents were married and expecting twins when his mom suffered some kind of hemorrhage and she ended up with eclampsia. My husband's mom and twin sister did not make it. But my husband did after a period of time in the NICU. His dad told him it was his fault they died. He had grandparents who meant the world to him and tried to shield him from his dad's anger, but when he was 8 years old they died also. His father then blamed him. He spent the next 10 years hearing day after day that he was the reason. At no point did he have another person to reassure him it wasn't.

When we met he had just started to heal. He was away from his dad and attending therapy. It was a very big fear of his that what his dad said was true.

He is a wonderful man and my nieces and nephew's adore him. He was always so good with them and the rest of my family.

In January 2020 I was pregnant and we went for a scan where we learned I had miscarried. As soon as my husband heard this, something inside of him broke. He started to unravel. He was in the middle of a mental health crisis. He was doing this weird manic laugh that was also a sob. He ran out of the room and I followed after him, concerned. My mom and sister both work at the hospital (sister's a nurse while mom worked in the little gift store). Both saw him in this worst moment. They saw as medical personnel were forced to intervene because he was in the middle of a breakdown, hysterical and totally out of it. He was totally broken and nothing could reach him. It was the scariest moment of my life. The worst moment of his.

And they judged him for ""laughing"". Then when they told the rest of the adults in my family, they also judged him. All of my family were aware of his history. He told them about it years ago.

My husband ended up under the care of a psychiatrist who suggested he needed a lot more help than therapy could provide. Instead of understanding my family no longer wanted him around. They said a man who could laugh at his own wife's miscarriage was not the kind of man they wanted around the kids. I told them I would not leave him behind.

My niece is turning 12 this year and is having her first big party since Covid. She called and said she wanted us there but she hadn't seen us on her mom's list. I told her we wouldn't be able to come and that I was sorry, we both were. She was upset and asked why she never saw us. Why we wouldn't come to her birthday party. Why we missed them all now.

AITA for calling my wife ridiculous for saying that she won't attend my family's christmas over some stockings?,"
My mom has a tradition for every christmas and that is to get custon stockings of her grandchildren's names (Cody, Mia, Sammy, Alaina...etc...) and hang those stockings near the fireplace.


My wife and I have been together for 3 years. She has a son (my stepkid) from her former marriage. When she found out about the tradition mom has, she said she expects my stepson to get his own custom stocking and be hanged along with the other kids' stockings. I asked my mom and she said that she loves her step grandchild but does not feel comfortable yet to have a stocking of his name and gang it in her home. Apparently, my wife refused to drop it and chose it as a hill to die on and even told me she would not be attending christmas party if mom doesn't do it. We started arguing about it for days. I finally blew up and told her it was not reasonable for me or her to dictate how my mom decorates her home and what stockings she hangs. She started crying and called me 'blind' for not seeing how my family are treating my stepson. I said they love him and a some stocking isn't going to prove anything. She said she wouldn't go then and I called her ridiculous for deciding not to go over something so trivial.

I have been waiting for them to go through with the purchase since august, I have been paying the mortgage on his home ever since. In February I warned them that I was sick of paying for two mortgages and that I needed them to go through with the purchase, they have dragged their feet ever since and told me that it was in their lawyers hands and they had no control.

AITA for asking my son to get a paternity test,"My son (18) has found out one of his ex girlfriends is 8 months pregnant. He knew nothing of the sort of her being pregnant until now and now he's just expected to accept everything no questions asked. 

My daughter (20) is good friends with this girl and knew about her pregnancy but said nothing to us because her friend asked her not to.

My son was head over heels for this lady but she ended up breaking his heart by cheating on him and was very needy and manipulative, he spend alot of money on her because she would ask for gift my son couldn't even afford and convince him to use one of my credit cards to achieve it. 

My daughter who isn't Currently living with us and is actually rooming with her by her college is also being manipulated by her and think she only dose good and doesn't believe that she convinced her brother to use my credit or that she even cheated. Showed up with my son's ex girlfriend at my door to help her tell us that she's pregnant. 

When I seen her there at my door visually pregnant I knew she was gonna be saying that my son is the father of her child and immediately said that my son will not be putting in any money or time until there is a paternity test proving that is his child, My son backed me up and agreed. 

My daughter was horrified by my comment and accused me of encouraging him to be a dead beat father and was upset I didn't even give them a chance to explain themselves. 

My son's ex starting crying saying you always assume the worst of me and that she went 8 months of pregnancy alone and the least we could do is ensure she is taken care of for the betterment of his child.

I do agree that if this is his child we gonna ensure mom is doing well to ensure baby is doing well but I don't want my son to be involved with her only to get his heart broken again and only to find out that the child isn't his. 

Am I the asshole here

Just a quick update-- 

My daughter and I spoke on the phone i explained to her, that if the baby really is his then the text will only lock in his responsibility for the baby and that their is no way I'd ever encourage my son to abandon any of my grandbabies, my daughter finally agreed that the test would be beneficial and told me she'd call me back later. 

I ended up getting a text back instead of a call asking if they could come back over to talk, which i agreed to. When they came over my son's ex admitted to not actually knowing who the father was and that she been in a relationship with multiple guys which is why she took so long telling my son because she was trying to figure out who's the father of her child but she's now certain it's my son. She agreed to do the paternity test as soon as we able to do one on the condition I pay for it. 

One other thing I found out is that my daughter and my son's ex have actually developed a romantic relationship, which is beyond shocking to me, i mean it explains why she been sticking up for my son's ex as much as she been doing but it's just not something I thought my daughter would ever do I mean that's her brother ex, someone who break his hreat it's just not something I can understand.

AITA for not sharing my dinner with my diabetic roommate and causing him to have a hypoglycemic episode?,"

I (23M) rent with 3 guys, Ty, Michael, Simon, Simon has diabetes and he's having a hard time managing it. 

Here's how the problem started - I'm the last to get home, I arrive at 8 where the guys are all home. Everytime I try to order food from the restaurant, I'd ask the guys if they want to order as well. they say no at first but once my food arrives, they gather around me in the livingroom and help themselves to my food. It irked me a lot since it kept happening and I'm too nice to tell them off.

Days ago, I came home Simon sitting on the couch, the other guys were still out. Before I ordered food, I, *again* asked if he wanted some and he said no, this time to avoid having to share my food, I decided to go eat in my room once the food arrived. ngl I got some looks from Simon but I thought nothing of it.


I went to bed at 11pm. and at around 2am I woke up to loud knocking on my door, I then opened the door and Ty yelled saying that Simon just had a hypoglycemic episode and Muchael drove him to the hospital after I refused to share my dinner with him earlier. from what I understand, he didn't eat for hours and was *counting* on eating dinner with me but I took the food to my room and he didn't get any. Ty and I started arguing after he called me selfish fuck for hiding/withholding the food and letting Simon go through this knowing he's diabetic and can't stay without food for long periods of time. He thanked God they recognized his symptoms and took him the the hospital early. I said I already asked if Simon wanted to eat and he said no - Ty said it's cause of Simon was gonna say that since he'd no money to buy food and was hoping I'd share but I hid it instead. I said I wasn't obligated to pay for others food which set him off on me about how horrible my attitude was over few dollars but money is an issue for me.


Simon hasn't talked to me but Michael and Ty kept blaming me and said that they no longer trust me around Simon. Moreover, Michael called Simon's parents. I had an argument with him cause of this and he said I have no excuse for treating a diabetic like that. I've been getting a lot of bashing from them over that and I have been feeling incredibly guilty thinking that I might have contributed to this in a way.",18305,td59k7,"You asked; he said no. 3 HOURS after you'd gone to bed he had an episode and had to be taken to hospital.

As a diabetic I would expect he'd know he should have food to hand, or ensure he'd eaten sooner, or take the offer of food. You're not psychic.

AITA for crying at dinner on purpose to embarrass my dad and brother?,"I know the title sounds ridiculous, but there's context! 

I'm currently in high school and I live with my dad and brother (my mom's not in the picture anymore). While I'm not very close with my father, he's not a bad dad. He's just a little old fashioned so he's closer to my brother (they have the same hobbies, etc.). 

Onto the problem: I don't know how it started, but for the past couple of my months both my dad and my brother will start teasing me about ""that time of the month"" any time I even get remotely irritated or upset at them. For example, my brother ate a snack of mine that I was saving, and when I got mad he just joked, ""oh no, is it that time again"" in a super annoying voice. 

I've kept trying to tell them separately and together that it's really annoying and offensive, and I feel like they're totally minimizing how I feel about things I feel I had valid reasons for being annoyed about. They just brush it off even MORE and chalk it up to my period no matter what time of the month it is.

Well, yesterday we had dinner with my whole family on my dad's side for my aunt's birthday. Before the dinner I got in a huge fight with my brother because he broke my iPad and instead of apologizing he just said the whole ""time of the month thing"". I can admit that by the time we got to my Grandma's house I was pretty pissed. 

My cousin asked me what was wrong during dinner and before I could explain my brother interrupted with ""oh its just *lady* problems"". 

I usually just ignore him or hold things in, but I had enough and just started bawling. I can admit that I kind of went HAM on purpose to cause a scene, and it freaked my whole family out. My aunt asked my dad why I was so upset, and when he didn't know I told my aunt, ""It's just *lady* reasons according to dad and brother."" 

My aunt and grandma were PISSED at my dad and brother and they totally got reamed at the dinner table. It was a whole ""thing"" and I could tell they were super embarrassed. 

Later that night my brother and dad said I was an AH for causing a scene and embarrassing them, but I said that I was just acting like how always say I do. I guess I didn't have to do it during dinner, but it wasn't like I planned it.",18309,wxyxj9,"If they are embarrassed about people finding out how they treat you, then they shouldn’t treat you that way.

"AITA for telling my MIL that once she reads up on basic 6th grade biology, she’s free to give me a call and apologize?","I (28f) have been married to my husband Cam (32m) for two years, and we’ve been together for 4 in total. He was a friend of my older brother, so I’ve known him even longer.

Cam and I decided to try for a baby, and now I’m currently 20wks with our first. When we told my MIL the news, the first thing she mentioned was that every woman in the family had a son before they had a daughter, so she thought the baby would be a boy.
Cam and I told her we didn’t care what we were having, we just wanted a happy and healthy child.

Well I’m having a girl, and we informed my MIL of this earlier in the evening. Cam and I weren’t onboard with the idea of a huge dramatic gender reveal so we just decided to go with casual announcements. MIL immediately seemed upset at this and she told me that next time I need to try harder to give my husband a son. I laughed and said I didn’t really have much of a choice in the matter, so if and when we have another child, there’s nothing I could do to make sure we had a boy then either.

She said that it was a fault on my end, because she had a boy first (she had all boys), all of her other sons wives had boys first, so that meant I was the odd one out.

Cam told his mom that he didn’t care about having a son or not, and that she needed to stop blaming me for something that couldn’t possibly be my fault but then she started getting onto him about how he should want a child that can carry on the family name instead of a daughter that will just be given away.

The whole thing was absolutely ridiculous, so I told her that once she looks into getting a refresher course and reading up on basic biology she should have learned in the 6th grade, she’s free to give me a call and apologize for being absolutely ridiculous.

My husband and I left after that, and in the car he said that while he understood my frustration, he didn’t appreciate me speaking to his mother like that because I basically implied that she was an idiot.
I told him that I didn’t appreciate the way she was speaking to me and that he should be upset on behalf of our daughter since his mom clearly seems to think less of our child before she’s even been born.

The rest of the car ride was silent, and honestly we haven’t talked since getting back home either.
He did defend me to her, so I know he’s on my side, but I know he wouldn’t have brought up the way I spoke to her unless he really thought it was out of line. I feel like a bit of an AH now, and I’m not sure if I should apologize to her or not.",18289,xyf71y,[removed],544,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xyf71y/aita_for_telling_my_mil_that_once_she_reads_up_on/
AITA for coming home early from meeting bf’s parents?,"My bf and I went to see his parents for the first time this weekend. It’s Canadian thanksgiving. We were suppose to stay Sat, Sun and fly back afternoon Monday. I’m writing this Sun night already back in my own bed. 

My bf’s parents greeted us at the airport and brought us home. They then proceeded to ask me if I had drugs in my bag and I was pretty shocked because who asks that? I said only Tylenol and they nodded and showed us to our rooms which meant I got the guest room and my bf was to sleep in his old room. His parents were serving dinner and during dinner I was asked to pay for my portion of the thanksgiving dinner ($30). I was pretty shocked and angry because who does that? I’ve never been asked to pay for someone’s ingredient fees when a guest at their place. 

I didn’t answer and then confronted my bf in his room and asked why I was asked to pay. He just says it’s something they ask of their friends as well, when they have a bbq they ask people to pay their portion. Honestly I’m shocked they have friends. I reminded him he has eaten at my parents place dozens of time and was never asked to pay. He claimed if they asked he would have but they never did. Because it’s rude to do that to a guest! But his mom came and got me and escorted me to my room. I was fuming and looking for tickets home and texted my bf to say I was going home tomorrow. He called me and begged me to stay saying his family already don’t like me for not agreeing to pay for dinner and I’m just making it worse. I ignored him and rebooked an early flight (which was very expensive) and got a cab to the airport in the morning. I told my friends this who had confirmed they’ve never been asked to pay for a meal while they were a guest. And if they were struggling why even invite me over? Is this normal practice? Their house was pretty big I don’t think it was a money thing for them.",18288,y0426o,NTA that is WEIRD. But it’s also weird that bf didn’t warn you.

AITA for eating my fast food in the car so my girlfriend can’t have the first bite?,"I have been living with my girlfriend for the past six months. We’re both in our early 20s and have an overall great relationship.

From well before our relationship began, I’ve been a big fast food eater. There’s an intersection in my city that hosts seven different fast food restaurants, and I’ll frequent basically all of them. Since I do shift work I’m generally off the clock at around 11am, and then being too tired to cook, I’ll hit up a burger joint for a cheeseburger and some fries. 

My girlfriend always wants to have exactly one bite, exclusively the first bite, of every item I order. When I noticed this, I would start by contacting her on my way to the restaurant asking if she wanted something. Her answer was consistently “no.” But when I get home and dig in, the crinkling of a fast food bag is like Pavlov’s bell to her. She’ll immediately beeline straight for wherever I’m eating and ask if she can have a bite.

I’ve asked if I could just leave a little at the end. No, she wants the first bite.

I’ve pleaded with her to just let me buy her food. No, she doesn’t want to eat that much.

I’ve tried ordering a bit more and letting her polish off the whole burger. No, she’ll turn every item into a sampler platter and then throw away the food I bought for her after the first bite if I don’t eat it.

I don’t like it. I don’t like this bizarre culinary version of *jus primae noctis*. For the past few weeks I’ve been eating in my car and discretely disposing of the wrappers. I was just telling her I wasn’t hungry after work, but the other day she found a garbage bag full of fast food wrappers in our bin on garbage day and she’s furious at me for lying to her.

AITA for not letting my baby daddy's fiancé name our baby?,"My baby daddy Jasper (25M) and I(27F) had a ONS, I'm currently 24 weeks pregnant. There was no cheating, but that's not important for the story.

Jasper's fiancé, Maddy (23F) lost their first child a year a year ago, I can't imagine going trough child-loss and I've been trying to be accommodating to her, but I've set a few rules:

1. She can't treat me as a surrogate because I'm not. This is Jasper and I's kid. She'll be the STEP-MOM, not the ADOPTIVE-MOM.
2. She can't be in the delivery room, I'm only allowed to have two people there and I chose to had Jasper and my mom. She argued and she really tried to push it, she wanted me to haver her a Jasper, I said no. She wanted me to have her and my mom then, I said no. I was clear that even if Jasper wasn't in the room with me, she wouldn't be allowed either way because I'm not comfortable.
3. She can't take big decisions for our kid on her own, she can suggest and she can ask. But she can't take them unless is an emergency.

Aside from that, we're all aware that this situation is not common and we will have to learn along the way, a few days ago we three went out to have dinner and Jasper asked if I had given any thought into our kids name, I said yes and gave him a list, I told them they can add some names to it and then we three could discuss them and chose one, Maddy told me she wanted to give them her dad's name as a middle name since it was special to her, Ill be honest, I don't like the idea because a family name (and a father's one) seems very personal, also I didn't liked it that she behaved like the decision was set since that's not our deal. Jasper didn't seemed that fond of the idea either so I told her that, while we could consider it and think about it, I wasn't sure. Maddy got quite pissy and said that it wasn't fair that she wasn't allow to have or say anything without passing it through the ''mom police'' because this was her child too. She can't be in the delivery room, she won't gave birth to them or have any legal rights and the least *I could do* is let her have the middle name.

Jasper tried to argue with her but Maddy refused, took her things and left us there. We stayed back for a while and he apologized for her before taking me back to my house. My mom says that she understands Maddy's pov, I'm having a child with her man after losing her own baby and she's not allowed to do *anything* without me or Jasper saying yes first and that maybe I should let her have it since middle's name doesn't matter anymore. I still don't entertain the idea but I want to ask anyway. I'll be happy to give more INFO if someone need it.

ETA: for come clarification we had a threesome and I got pregnant.

ETA: Woa, I didn't think this would blow up like this. I want to clarify some things.

1. Please, stop saying that Maddy is unhinged or crazy, neither of us planned this pregnancy nor is she traying to steal my baby.
2. I'm not living with them and neither are they living with me. We see each other regularly, yes, and we are still sleeping together (I called it a ONS to clarify that I got pregnant after only 1 time of being with them at the beginning)
3. While I'm still sleeping with both of them, the three of us AGREED that it meant nothing more. It didn't make us partners and they've their own relationship. I never sleep with just Maddy or with just Jasper, and it has happened only 3 times after I told them about the baby.
4. The three of us had a long talk today and I got to clarify many things with Maddy. Thank you all for your judgment, I accept them all. ",18261,tgh8th,Man idk....yikes.

WIBTA if I give a family heirloom belonging to my late wife to my adopted daughter?,"My late wife Kate passed away about 12 years ago. They have a family heirloom that has passed down several generations (starting from her great grandmother) from mothers to their first daughters, on their 18th (or thereabouts) birthdays. The heirloom itself is not highly valuable in a financial sense, but the history makes it very valuable to the people in the family. I currently possess it after Kate passed away and I always intended to give it to my daughter, Claire, on her 18th birthday. She is currently 16.

I married my current wife about 8 years ago. My step daughter, Sarah, (whom I have adopted and consider my own daughter) is 17 years and 11 months old, her 18th birthday is in a month. My wife has also adopted Claire and we all consider each other as just one family.

My wife asked me to give the heirloom to Sarah on her birthday to continue the tradition. I was hesitant because I always intended it to give it to Claire who is Kate's only daughter as this is what she would have wanted and is the continuation of the tradition. My wife counters that this belongs to our family now and we should give it to our eldest daughter on her 18th birthday, and therefore this should be Sarah. I told her that while I consider Sarah to be my daughter but she's not Kate's daughter, this belongs to Kate and should go to Kate's daughter. My wife said Claire is HER daughter, not anyone else's and wife accused me of playing favorites and told me that if I truly consider Sarah to be my daughter then I'll do the right thing for her or that I haven't really accepted Sarah as a real daughter yet.

I consulted my son (from Kate, 25 years old) and he told me that if I do this he's going to walk from the birthday party and that he bets he won't be the only one. He said if I do this I should be ready for severe consequences. He left in a very frustrated way. His argument in the end was that ""this isn't yours to give away. It was mom's and now belongs to Claire.""

My wife thinks my son is overreacting and it's only because due to his age and moving out he's never bonded with Sarah like Claire and I have, so he doesn't consider Sarah to be his real sister, otherwise he'd be happy for her. My wife thinks Claire will be happy about this since she considers Sarah to be her big sister and it will bring the girls even closer together because Sarah will happily share it with Claire and they'll both have it.

So would I be the asshole if I did what my wife wants me to do and give the heirloom to Sarah?",18249,vvym1j,"Yeah, yta if you do.

It isn't your family's heirloom.

AITA for filing a police report against my nephew?,"My mom has late stage Alzheimer’s and has been unable to manage her money and needs around the clock care. It probably would be safer to put her in a nursing home but she made us promise to only do that as a last resort. Thankfully she had a lot of investments and savings from my dad before he passed so we can get her a hired personal carer in her own home.My sister is the one who lives the closest and visits her often so she handles mom’s finances. We give my sister $200/month each for her to run errands and help look after mom since we both live out of state. 

My other sister called me to tell me there’s been a lot of cash withdrawals recently on my mom’s card. I check and there’s nearly a years worth of $3-400s withdrawn. We call my sister who is handling finances and she is confused and says she never takes out any cash she only pays bills with the bank card and uses cc for the groceries etc. She freezes the bank card and I take a red eye over. Long story short we asked the bank where the atm withdrawal happened. My sister looks shocked when she Googles the location and realizes it’s close to her son’s school.

We waited until the son got home and asked him where he worked and he said a local restaurant. We said we would like to go with him to the restaurant to confirm he works there and he got really panicked and said the management just changed so they wouldn’t know him.I ask for his paycheck and finally he gives up and admits he doesn’t have a job. My sister asked him where the money for the new stuff he bought home comes from and he admits he steals the bank card to make cash withdraws. I asked him where he got the pin and my sister confessed she writes her pins on sticky notes so she doesn’t forget them 🤦‍♂️.

I take the bank statements and calculate out that he owns $14,308. I told him he has to pay it back now or I’m filing a police report on him for theft and my sister begs me not to saying if he has anything on his record he might not get into college. I told her I won’t if she pays it but she said she’s struggling and doesn’t have the money(she’s a single mother). I told her that isn’t good enough and she complains her son is only 16 and doesn’t know any better. I told her they won’t put a 16 year old in jail but he might do it again when he’s older so it’s better to learn his lesson now. She said we can just take that out of what her son’s inheritance would be from our mom and I yell at her that if our mom was in a state to judge she would write him out of her will for this. 

I call up my lawyer and ask what I should do and he suggests filing a police report but not including my nephew’s name just yet. I did just that and my sister is screaming at me that I’m ruining her son’s life by involving the police and he’s only a kid. I’m not happy about it but at 16 if he’s stealing from his own grandma who looked after him when his mom was sick I can’t imagine what he’s going to do when he’s older.",18223,tpxsfw,"NTA.

AITA I lied to the people who I was babysitting for to get them to come home.,"I am 15 years old and I babysit to make money.  I took a first aid course and a babysitting course. 

Lat weekend one of my little sister's classmates parents had a wedding to go to and asked if I would babysit.  I asked how late they would need me and if I should pack an overnight bag if they were going to be staying out all night.  They said that they would be home by midnight. So I checked with my dad if that was okay because he is my ride. He doesn't want me alone in a car with adults that he does not know. 

So my dad was there to pick me up at 11:50. The kids were all asleep and I was watching tv.  I had texted them at 11:00 to double that they would be in time.  The mom texted me back ""yes"". 

12:30 they still aren't there.  I texted again. No answer.  I called my dad and he is pissed.  Not at me. One o'clock. I call them.  No answer.  My dad went and got a coffee at home and came back.  He is all calm.  Not good. He is ready to blow.  

I texted every 15 minutes. No response. 

2:20 I have an idea.  I texted them that someone tried to break into their garage but that the alarm scared them away.  

They were home drunk in an Uber in 15 minutes.  My dad made their pay me for my extra time before we left.  He told me that I'm not allowed to babysit for them again unless I charged them for an overnight stay. 

Yesterday at school I saw the mom when I was picking up my sister's after school.  

She gave me shit for scaring her and her husband.  That they had checked their security cameras and no one tried to break in.  I said sorry the alarm went off so I called you.  

She called me a liar.  Which is fair. But I don't feel bad about what I did. They lied to me first. 

My mom says I should have just sucked it up but my dad says that they broke our deal.  

I kind of feel bad for tricking them into coming home from their party.  But they could have told me it was an overnight or texted me that they were going to be late.  My dad has brought me an overnight bag before when that has happened.

AITA for not helping my parents when they are homeless?,"My parents are terrible with money. When I(27F) was little my father gambled away all the saving about $100,000 in risky penny stocks which got wiped out in 2008 and we were forced to move into a single bedroom in a house for the 3 of us. Then my mom fell for an MLM and you can image what happened, they lost the down payment to the house they were saving for. I begged them not to sign up for it since I saw it was clearly a scam and showed them evidence it was and they just laughed at me and ignored me. 

They lost about $28,000 from that. Then recently they fall for a college signup scam and lost $32,000. They weren’t signing up for college they just needed a loan and tried to go though a “private broker” who promised to get them a school loan that they would use on whatever they wanted. I went with them to see the broker and told them it was a scam and they ignored me. So basically they were trying to scam the government and got scammed instead. I actually tried to pry the pen away from my father hands when I got desperate as he was writing down his bank info and SSN and he screamed at me I was embarrassing him and did it anyway. 

Again they lost money and now they are homeless because their credit is crap and they can barely afford even crappy apartments. They probably can’t get that money back since they have little documentation on the broker and what he promised. Now they live in their car and are begging me for money. I have about $100,000 saved waiting to buy a house and they know about it because I stupidly told them I was saving for a house and now are calling me and showing up at my apartment asking for money. They also want to move in in the meantime but my roommate and I agreed visitation from friends or family is max a week to prevent resentment and if my parents move in they probably will refuse to move out.

I looked around and everyone was staring. I responded by saying ""And the reason you got a demotion was because of your brain size!!!"". His face went pale and people were laughing. He was pissed beyone belief he turned around and walked out. Some co workers approached me saying that Michael's reputation is ahead of him and that he's one of the best this company hired but due to his circumstances he couldn't focus on work and got demoted as a result. so I shouldn't imply he was stupid and humiliate him infront of everybody.

I explained that wasn’t the case but she didn’t want to hear me, I respected her decision and asked if she still wants to hold the baby, she grabbed by son from me and within 5 minutes he had a death grip on her nipples and she jumped up screamed in pain and pulled him off of her.

I said “that’s why I suggested a bra” this made her even more mad and said “No you suggested that because you’re a misogynist”. I was so confused and she left abruptly.

She keeps telling our mutual friends that I was sexualizing her breast and was trying to make her wear a bra or that i wouldn’t welcome her but that isn’t at all what happened 

Am I missing something? I feel like her reaction is really uncalled for

ETA: in the midst of our arguing she suggested that i should teach my son to not grab nipples but he is just a baby",18155,u3iwl7,"**I explained that wasn’t the case but she didn’t want to hear me, I respected her decision and asked if she still wants to hold the baby, she grabbed by son from me and within 5 minutes he had a death grip on her nipples and she jumped up screamed in pain and pulled him off of her.**

AITA for telling my parents I won't attend their christmas celebration until they send my husband a separate invitation?.,"I'll preface this by saying that my husband (Luke) M32 does not get along with my parents. You can't tell who's right or who's wrong, there's always this ongoing tension between them but can be civil enough to sit together at one table.


I recently got an invitation for christmas celebration from my parents. The invitation including me and Luke but Luke thought this was somewhat rude and a disrespectful because he believes he should get his own invitation and not have his name mentioned as an ""extention"" to mine. We talked and he said he wouldn't go unless they send him a proper invitation. I called mom and asked if she could do it. She thought it was ridiculous and said that she and dad did the same with my sister and her husband. I told her it was fine but Luke can be sensitive like that and so a simple invitation in a form of a text directly to him will fix it. She got defensive and said that Luke is being ridiculous. Dad claimed that Luke is trying to pull some power move to humiliate them but I thought this was a small issue. They still thought it was ridiculous so I told them I won't attend if they don't send him a separate invitation because he won't attend if he doesn't get it. This blew up and my sister started arguing saying Luke needs to get over himself and shamed me for trying to ""force"" our parents to send him an invitation by saying I won't come if they don't.


We haven't talked after that and we're waiting as of now.


edit! The invitation I recieved was in a text. Luke is saying that a simple text to him will finish the conflict but my parents still think it's ridiculous and that they won't invite him since they already have.


**UPDATE! I just got off the phone with my sister. She told me our parents have just disinvited me (Luke was probably already disinvited since the argument occured) from the celebration. I feel horrible but I can't argue anymore, just like I can't argue about what everybody else in the comments is saying. I admit it! Luke is the problem. He just caused me to be disinvited from the event and is blaming ME for it.**",18136,zd5vpq,"YTA you’re a couple, why on earth would they send individual invites?!?

AITA (AWTA) for not giving our granddaughter the same wedding gift as our other grandchildren?,"First of all, this is my first post on here ever, I wanted an objective opinion and I have read a lot of these kinds of posts on Facebook. If I do anything wrong please tell me.

I(70s F) am the grandmother to 5 wonderful grandkids (3 women and 2 men). The last of my grandkids got married last October. My husband (70s M) and I usually get them a small gift (usually the cheapest thing on the registry), then the day before the wedding, we privately gift them a check for $40k, we prefer that they use it for a house, but we don’t force them to do so. We also ask them to keep it private (we have a big extended family, and we don’t want them to expect it from us). They all honored this request.

When it came to our youngest granddaughter, we bought her an air fryer (that was the cheapest thing on the registry) and sent it in advance. Then she called us furious, she went off on us for being cheap and how she knew we had money, but that we did not love her enough to show it by getting her something more expensive.

We were horrified by her behavior, then she went ahead and threatened to disinvite us if we didn’t get her a better gift. We discussed it, bought her a China set, but we did not give her the money that was set aside for her. We decided that she did not deserve it.

Fast foreword to last week, she met up with her brother, they got to talking and she found out about the cash gift that he got. She asked her cousins and found out all of them got the same gift. She called us furious for discriminating against her. We told her that it was our money, and after how she behaved, we did not want to give it to her.

She started crying, said that she was just extremely stressed, and that we shouldn’t have taken it to heart. We told her that we stand by our decision. Now she is refusing to attend Christmas, and her mother (our DIL) is calling us AHs. So AWTAs.",18136,zoa8ez,"NTA!! 

Let me tell you a personal story.. my grandparents saved well and lived VERY frugally. By the time my grandfather passed away, my gram was left with enough money that she could have lived 100 more years without ever having to worry about a thing. She also lived well below her means. 

Every Christmas after he died when I was a teenager (she didn’t like to drive my grandpa always did all the driving) she would always get me 1 gift and 1 $50 gift card. 

I’ll never forget the Christmas I opened up the UGLIEST mint green sweater I’ve ever seen in my life! LOL When I say this sweater was god awful that is being kind to it….it was truly terrible! Hahaha 

I looked over at her biting her lower lip with a look of hope on her face, and gave her the brightest most genuine smile. I told her I absolutely LOVED IT! I gave her the biggest hug, thanking her profusely. I’ve never seen her look so happy. 

Despite her including a gift receipt, I kept that sweater, and I wore that sweater often when I’d go to visit her. As much as I truly hated the way that sweater looked, I really did love it. I loved it because I knew the effort my elderly grandmother put into driving (which terrified her) out to the mall (which she hated) to personally shop for me, and try to find something she thought I would like. That meant everything to me! 

Years later she still would cry as she told my dad, that out of all of her many grandchildren- I was the only one who EVER thanked her….year after year after year everyone else took her for granted until she was gone. I could NEVER imagine treated my grandparents this way!! 

My point is you are NTA!! please keep your money. It’s yours and even if you do give her a check- she will still never appreciate you for it. She will still take you for granted…. You and your husband should use that money and take a cruise to Alaska to see the glaciers, my grandparents loved doing that together. ❤️",247,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zoa8ez/aita_awta_for_not_giving_our_granddaughter_the/
AITA for asking my friend to move a picture of him and his wife because it made my wife uncomfortable?,"

Me (M32) and my wife, Dahlia (F28) lost our apartment 2 months ago and moved in with mom temporarily. Issues began to arise between Dahlia and mom and I had to ask my friend, Anthony (M31) to let us move in til I get enough money to rent out. His wife was away visiting family and he agreed but even there, some issues started to arise.


Fyi, Dahlia is very shy around Anthony. She grew up in conservative home and so it's understandable, but sometimes it can be a bit much I admit that! 

For example, she freaked out when she accidently drank from his glass, she also once made a fuss when he passed by the guests room when she was lying down and the door was open. Thankfully, Anthony was super understanding and we were able to talk some of these issues out.


Last night, Dahlia was passing the hall and noticed a framed picture of Anthony and his wife kissing hanging on the wall. She told me about it and said it made her uncomfortable. She asked if I could speak to Anthony about it but he didn't take it well. He gave me a look when I spoke to him and said this was ""bonkers"" because first of all, his wife put it there. And second of all, the picture holds sentimental meaning to him and his wife and argued that it wasn't some ""explicit"" picture of them, just a normal wedding kiss. We started arguing and he said that it wasn't like it was hanging in the living room wall or a perfectly lit room. I asked him to be a little more considerate because it's not like I asked him to remove it completely, just move it elsewhere that Dahlia won't reach or keep it off the wall til we leave. He said he was sorry but still refused. I explained how Dahlia was feeling but he said that again, he was sorry but would not move the picture. We argued some more and he said that it's his house and that I was being pushy and kind of too comfortable to make such ""demand"" and be pushy still.


This morning, Dahlia refused to even come out of the room until the picture is moved. Anthony is refusing which makes it worse. Now I feel like I'm getting stuck between a rock and a hard place. Yes she might just be over reacting but I feel like this isn't such a big ask for Anthony to decline and turn down. fwiw If it were me, I'd go the extra mile to make sure my guests are comfortable.


Anthony has been a friend of mine for 10 years. I wouldn't have asked to move in with him if I didn't have such strong bond with him. He himself constantly talks about all the things and situations I helped him out with and we are considered brothers.",18136,yiplwk,YTA and this is a deeply unreasonable request from your wife.

AITA for asking my girlfriend to start making me breakfast every morning?,"I (27m) have been living with my girlfriend (29f) for several months now. For the most part things are really good and I plan to propose soon and hopefully have at least a couple of kids with her.

However we've run up against a conflict.

She's an absolute morning person. I hate mornings. By the time I force myself out of bed in the morning and into the shower she's already been up for at least 30 minutes--even though she has to be at work later than I do--and is at the stove making breakfast. She likes a huge breakfast in the morning. She usually has eggs, either French toast or pancakes, hashbrowns or breakfast potatoes, and sausage or bacon. Sometimes on weekends it's ham or steak. She eats almost nothing for lunch and usually has a smallish dinner but she loves a huge breakfast.

Meanwhile I only ever have cold cereal for breakfast, or MAYBE if I'm feeling really ambitious some instant oatmeal and orange juice. I only even start to come alive halfway through my second cup of coffee and definitely don't feel like cooking in the morning.

However my girlfriend obviously does. So recently I asked her if she'd start making breakfast for me, too. She asked if we were going to trade off and if I'd sometimes make breakfast for her, too. I told her ""no"" but reminded her that I do often make dinner for her. She said that since we trade off making dinner we should trade off making breakfast, too. I told her that there is no way I'll ever be able to muster that kind of energy first thing in the morning, but that since she obviously can that she should just make me breakfast too. I said that it would take next to no extra effort on her part to throw in a couple more eggs, strips of bacon, an extra portion of hashbrowns, etc since she's already doing it for herself, anyway. But it started a fight, with her saying that it wasn't fair for me to expect her to think of me in the morning since I don't do the same for her.

She seems to think that her making breakfast for me should figure into our division of labor and that I should do something extra in return. But I think that since she makes a huge breakfast for herself every morning anyway that throwing an extra portion of whatever she's making on for me would take next-to no effort on her part, so why should I have to do more for her in return than I already do?",18100,z5ys4j,INFO:.

AITA for arguing with my husbands doctor and acting like a Karen because they wouldn't listen,"Husband has a sore foot. No injury or medical condition that would explain the pain but he hasn't been able to walk properly for about a week. Being the absolute pain in my ass that he is, he's refused to go to the doctors until today, apparently he preferred to just pop paracetamol and complain to me.

 It's gotten progressively more swollen and misshapen looking and today its gone a funny colour and he can't put any weight on it. So I called our GP who has sent him to the walk in clinic at our local hospital. 

We finally get seen and the doctor refused to even examine it. Told him without even looking at the foot that it was a sprain and he wasn't going to prescribe him any painkillers so not to ask. Then he started demonstrating some kind of exercises that involved going up and down on tiptoes and flexing the toes. 

I asked if he would please just look as it has gone nearly black in some spots and looks similar to how my wrist looked when I broke it a few years ago. He huffed at me and asked where my medical degree was from.  

It put my back up and I demanded to see another doctor or his senior. I was the asshole here because it wasn't me being treated so I get he thought I was a pushy cow- husband wouldn't say boo to a goose in medical situations and would have accepted the doctors instructions without any questions about actually needing to be examined.  

Doctor left and we heard him outside the cubicle telling the senior doctor that they have a confrontational spouse who thinks her Web md searching qualifies her to instruct real doctors how to practice medicine.  He also states that he suspects my husband of exaggeration to get opiates. 

By the time the other doctor arrives I'm seething and lay out exactly what went on and explained I only want someone to look at the foot before sending us away. 

He looks....cue xrays, an mri, the good painkillers and a walking boot cast thing with potential to need surgery because he's got 7 stress fractures in that foot- probably from running. Admittedly worse than they needed to be because he didn't get any treatment when it first started to hurt. 

Second doctor and someone from the hospital admin come and apologise for the first doctor and ask if we want to make a formal complaint. So I did because the outcome of his not listening to the patient or family could have been worse. Husband did not. 

Husband said later that the first doctor may get sacked because of me complaining and I should have left it because no real harm was done. 

Was it an AH move to complain? I don't usually have Karen tendencies but he was just so patronising and dismissive and I kept thinking what if it was a young mother with a sick baby and he dissmised that- not everything would stand their ground and there could be really serious consequences.

Edit: Thank you all for the comments and awards- I didn't expect this to go as mental as it did.

 I've shown hubby the post and he's starting to realise how serious it could have been and is going to email the admin guy we saw this afternoon- he gave us his contact details for my complaint. He's also agreed that delaying treatment the way he did was incredibly stupid and has decided to chase up the counselling referral with the gp so he will be less useless in future medical situations. 

Thankfully we were eventually given appropriate treatment and hopefully the follow up will be positive. I'll stick an update on here if there's anything interesting to report.

Once again thanks for setting my mind at ease and sharing your opinions",18042,uou5qr,"NTA

First, you were not being a Karen. Being a Karen is making something non-existent into an issue and/or being a jerk for no reason.

AITA for using 'insulting' wallpapers for my phone's home screen after my coworkers kept touching it?,"Ohhhkay. This might sound ridiculous but allow me to take the time to explain.

So I (M28) started working at this company for 6 months. My guy coworkers are decent. However, I noticed a pattern with my female coworkers (a couple of them) which consists of them opening/looking through my phone whenever they get the chance (me using the bathroom/meeting etc). So far I've caught them doing it 3 times. They didn't take something or open any apps because I would've known but still didn't know why they kept snooping.


I wanted to tackle this issue in an non-confrontational way since they're both beyond sweet except for this snooping thing. So what I did was set up ""insulting"" or ""offensive"" wallpapers (some of them I made myself) wallpapers that say ""DON'T TOUCH MY PHONE ASSHOLE/MUGGLE/WEIRDO"" or ""I CAN SEE YOU"" (with John Cena waving his hand) or ""B_/_ DON'T TOUCH MY PHONE"" (with a middle finger in the middle of the screen). It was just an experiment but apparently it got to them. They claimed that I had ""offended them"" on a personal level, called them names and so on. I told them they had no business touching my phone but they made excuses saying they were just trying to borrow my charger/check the time etc etc. The office got split, some said I should've come to the ladies if I ""really"" had an issue. Some say I was justified and ultimately no one gets to control what I use as my wallpapers.

They're now expecting a formal apology but I refused.

AITA for telling my son's mom that he's staying with me while he recovers?,"My 9yo son needed hip bone osteoma surgery and his mom and I scheduled it before his three week winter break. My ex and I share 50/50 but I get him on winter breaks so she could take him our of state to see her family in the summer.

The day before the surgery she asked me if Ry could stay at her place to recover from the surgery. I asked her why and all she said was that she just wanted to be there. I said no. Ry has never had surgery and it's a big deal for him. I don't want him to think that the first thing you when you face something scary is run to your mom and not your dad.

I told her I was quite insulted by her request. Plus he was going to need help getting dressed, undressed and bathed for the first couple of days and I highly doubt that he'd be comfortable having his mom do that. She said her husband could do that.

I told her no. He's having the surgery and I'm taking him to my house when he's released. I don't care if she's in the operating room. 

She then asked if she could see him at my place and I said no. The agreement is that we have scheduled FaceTime with him when he's at the other parent's house. I don't want my ex wife in my home anymore than she wants me in hers. If the shoe was on the other foot then I'd understand whether I liked it or not. 

I held firm and things have been tense between us ever since. Personally I don't care because I'm not apologizing for not giving her what she wanted.

AITA for being honest about honeymoon sex,"My fiancé and I (I’m 26, he’s 28) are taking an 8 day honeymoon in Brazil, which is where he is originally from. This trip has been in the works for a long time, and a few weeks ago I learned that his parents were hoping to stop by and visit us during our honeymoon and even asked to stay with us (we have rented a 3 bedroom place near a beach) for 2 of the nights. 

I said absolutely not, and my husband agreed. He told them no, that it’s because we want our privacy. His parents, who I have grown very close to, sent me a separate text asking, in a lighthearted way (I thought!), if it was really a big problem and if I agreed with him, and I said yes, I did agree. His mom asked me why, and I was honest - I said I want to be able to be open and free with him with without thinking about houseguests. She said “so this is about sex?” I thought she was still being lighthearted, and I replied “if I’m being honest, I’m going to fuck hIs brains out in every room of that house.” No response.

So, this has become a whole thing. My mother in law thinks I’m disrespectful, my father in law thinks I’m a sex monster of some kind, my husband thinks it was way too far of me.

AITA for saying that i can’t do any chores in December and following through?,"I (f30) run a small online business from home. November and December are my busiest time of the year when I make a lot of money that allows me to work less during the year. I’ve been doing this since I was 25 so I’ve got a decent idea of what I can and cannot do. And focusing on work only for 1-2 months is a sacrifice I’m willing to make for chill rest of the year.

This year, I’ve moved in with my boyfriend (m35). Well, technically he moved in with me because i own the house so it was a no brainier for him to move in with me.

We split chores half and half. He works full time (37.5 hours a week). When he moved in, I had a talk with him letting him know that I can’t do any chores in November/December and asked if he could pick up the slack because I’m physically unable to do any chores as I can be working anything  between 12-18 hours a day (I take a full January off to decompress). He said he doubted I worked that much but we will see.

I asked again in September and October to make sure he was aware that I won’t be doing anything (I meal prepped in advance) and I felt he kind of dismissed me.
Mid November, we had an argument about my chores not being done and I reminded him of what I told him.

He said that he thought I wasn’t being serious and told me there’s no way he’d do 100% of chores because he’s working too. I said fine, don’t do my chores, they can wait until I have time. That’s how it was when I lived alone, no problem, I don’t make much mess anyway.

He wasn’t happy but dropped it.

We haven’t seen each other much because I’ve been working so much but he’s been more and more pissed off and blew up at me today regarding the chores.

He said I had to have a better work life balance and to grow up because the house was a mess. I told him if it was a mess it was his fault because I barely leave my office.

He called me a lazy bitch. I told him k didn’t have time for arguing and went back working.

He stood in front of my locked office door shouting how he couldn’t believe I was bei mg serious about not doing chores and it was an asshole move to leave it all to him.

"AITA for banning my husband from visiting my sister with me because he won’t stop trying to ""debate"" her and her husband?","My sister, Marie, (29) and her husband Zach (40) had their first child, a beautiful baby girl, 2 months ago. They have been pretty nervous parents, so when my husband Tom (42) and I (37) were invited to finally meet our niece, I was thrilled except I was worried about Tom making an ass out of himself.

You see, Tom and Marie have always had a hard time getting along because they do not agree on nearly anything, and Tom has always gotten a kick out of challenging Marie on their differing views because they are both very opinionated.

The thing is to Tom, it is funny to watch Marie react when he says things to provoke her, and Marie always wants to prove his views wrong. In his head, because she was in grad school for social sciences (she finished right before having her baby) and is knowledgeable about the topics that Tom wants to argue about, Marie shouldn’t have a problem with debating him because “it’s literally her job”. 

In the past, both Tom and Marie have initiated these arguments, and they have both been guilty of taking it too far in the past. But ever since she got pregnant/ had a baby Marie has calmed down a lot, whereas Tom still tries to “bait” her into debates about touchy subjects (mainly politics and personal values). This got to a point where Marie blocked him on all social media a few months ago.

Before we went to visit, I asked Tom to just be nice to Marie and Zach and not start anything. Tom said that he would try his best. I told him I would be very upset with him if he tried to “bait” Marie or Zach into an argument. Tom started out the evening pretty strong and kept to himself, until it was revealed that Zach was going to be the one to stay home with their daughter. Tom made a comment like, “oh I thought mom was supposed to do that”. 

Zach said that it was pretty sexist for Tom to say that and when Tom asked how, Zach told him that moms can have careers too, and that Marie shouldn't give up all the hard work she just did… Tom started on a tangent and Marie cut him off and told him to either quit or leave because she’s done entertaining his nonsense. Tom laughed it off, but it was still very awkward after this.

We didn’t stay for long after and when we got home, I told Tom that I am done with him embarrassing me and that he’s not allowed to join me whenever I visit Marie again, if I’m even invited back. I told him that it doesn’t make him look smart when he always insists on having these conversations, that it just makes him look like an ass and me like a fool.

Tom said I’m blowing this way out of proportion and that it’s not his fault that they got so offended, and that if anything they were rude to kick him out over his opinion. But Marie didn’t do anything to him this time, she didn’t snap back at him, she didn’t call him names, she just asked him to stop.

AITA? Am I being unreasonable?",18005,wv811n,"NTA. Tom sounds like the kinda guy who likes to pick fights just to see the fallout, because it's ultimately about control. He likes seeing the effect he has on people and seeing them get upset over something he says.

AITA for throwing my siblings in foster care so I can have a better life?,"I have roughly too many siblings, and even more step siblings. Between my parents and my latest stepfather, we had 8 kids living here. Myself (19F), 3 half siblings on my mom's side (15, 11, and 9), 4 stepsiblings (14, 12, 9, and 6), and 1 full sister (6f). 

Things have never been particularly good or stable, but now we're at rock bottom. My mother and stepfather are going to be going away for a long time, and everyone is in a rush to get all these kids into homes. I'm the only one who's over 18, so everyone wants me to do it. I don't want to. 

I'd gotten an opportunity. My grandma on my father's side offered to have 6f and I move in with her, and even pay for me to go to college. The thing is, she lives several states away. I talked to social services about this, and got the answer that I could move 6f without a problem because our parents were able to voluntarily gave me guardianship of her and I'm her full sister. The rest I could only take in if I stayed in this state because they would be a full foster care placement though.

I'm sorry, but being forced to stay here would destroy my future. I could definitely survive, but I would be stuck in this horrible place working paycheck to paycheck. I could never have a real life. I made the obvious choice. The social workers were nice enough to arrange it to where 6f and I weren't just standing in front of them during the pickup, but obviously they know exactly why they're now in care.

The four of them that have phones have been texting and calling me non-stop. Some of them for help, and some to just scream at me for abandoning them. I known the system is going to be really bad for them because of where they are and they're ages, but I just can't do it.

AITA for storming out after l didn't like the birthday present l was given?,"I(20F) recently turned twenty and had a party to celebrate turning 20. It was a small gathering at my favourite sushi restaurant with only my immediate family and a few friends. 

Everything was going well until it came time for the presents. You see, in my family there's this tradition that when the first born turns twenty, they are given this pocket watch that was owned by my great grandfather. When our country was still colonized by the British, he (my great grandfather) was taken in by some missionaries and became a teacher. As a teacher he was super instrumental to the community and partly funded the first black owned school there. He became headmaster and as thanks, the community chipped in to get him a pocket watch. When my grandfather turned 20 he was given the watch and it became a tradition. As per tradition, l was expecting to get the watch. I had even made an effort of hinting how l wanted a watch for the whole year prior. 

Among the presents l saw this small box and got excited thinking it was the watch. The watch came in this wooden casing with a velvet lining inside and it was about the same size as the box l saw. I made a deliberate choice to open that box last to make sure the night ended on a highlight. 

When it came time to opening the box, it was a watch but a digital one. It was a good watch to be honest but it wasn't THE watch. My dad was excited as he went on prattling about the features of the watch, it could count steps, connect to my phone via Bluetooth, control music, measure my heart rate etc. While he talking l burst into tears and left the table running. My dad follows and asks why l was sad and I said l wanted the watch, the one that belonged to my great grandfather. He said he wanted to give it to my younger brother who is 12 since he is boy. If he gives it to me, it will leave the family since I'll get married to a man and join his family. This came as a blow since I've always been closer to my dad than my brother was and my brother isn't even interested in the watch like l have been my whole life. We got into an argument and it ended with him saying my immaturity over such a small matter is why he wouldn't have given the watch to me even if l was a boy. I left after he said that. That was two weeks ago, and we haven't spoken since.

So am I the asshole?

Edit: (information) it's always been the first born who got it. But the first born's have always been men, since the tradition started, I'm the first female first born.

I suppose l shouldn't have stormed out, I'm twenty now after all, I was super overwhelmed by my feelings. I'm prone to tears, always have been but I should have calmed myself especially since it was a public space.",17966,t1rkxb,"NTA.

AITA for kicking my sister out for bringing gluten into our gluten-free kitchen?,"
My daughter is on the more severe end of celiac. ANY cross-contamination would set her back for weeks. It has taken us years to get her properly diagnosed and treated, and at 10 years old she now is underweight and has severe anxiety about food. She will not eat if she feels it's unsafe, and it's hard for me to blame her. 

Our house has both a kitchen and a kitchenette in the basement, complete with full sets of pans and utensils. Our main rule for the house is that there is absolutely no dairy, gluten, or seafood to be kept or cooked in the kitchen (our older son is allergic to seafood and my wife is lactose intolerant). The kitchenette is for items containing those ingredients. 

My sister and her kids have had to move in with us for personal reasons. They live in the basement bedrooms, and when they moved in, we very clearly explained this rule to them and why. It took less than a week for us to find a box of pasta in the kitchen. We explained the rule and moved it, and she was apologetic. A month later, my daughter comes to us in a panic because my sister was making fried chicken in the kitchen. My sister was apologetic, but insisted she needed to because the kitchenette was ""too small"". 

It felt harsh, but we moved all of the food to the basement, threw out every single pan and utensil she may have used, and deep cleaned the kitchen. These incidents making the kitchen no longer 100% guaranteed safe has made her regress in therapy. We're working on it, but unfortunately right now, it is so bad again that we have to feed her exclusively takeout from the one gluten-free restaurant around unless we want her in inpatient care. 

Which takes us to last Sunday. I get home, and my daughter is having the worst panic attack I have ever seen. My mom and sister were in the kitchen making an entire Sunday dinner. Spaghetti, mozzarella sticks, garlic bread, the works. I lost it. 

I ended up absolutely screaming at them that they were ruining my life and had threatened my daughter's life for the last time, and I had had it. I threw all of the food out into the yard, and told my sister that if she really cared that little about her own niece's life, she could get the fuck out of my house. Now my mom is mad at me for kicking out my sister and her kids when they're vulnerable over ""a food allergy"" but I don't care. She can even leave the kids here if she absolutely needs to, but I'm done with her. We have ONE rule. ONE. My wife agrees with me but thinks I should give one last chance and just not allow sister to bring ANY food into the house. My mom can't take her in and she can't afford rent anywhere, so she would be homeless if we didn't let her stay. I'm not sure I'm in the wrong here.

Edit: 

The possibility of inpatient care has come up before, and been fully investigated by her medical team. If she went into inpatient care, she would be eating takeout from the same restaurant there as well as they would also not be able to safely cook for her in their facilities. The only true differences would be more monitoring and not being at home.",17951,wvqyif,"After watching you deep clean your kitchen once already because of her actions, your sister decided, apparently, it wasn't that big of a deal, you'd just do it, again.

AITA for kicking my fiance out of the house for letting my snake loose outside?,"I(27M) have always been an animal lover. I love snakes, tarantulas, scorpions, lizards, geckos, dogs, cats. When I moved out of my parents' house and into my townhome, I decided to adopt a ball python. She is very docile and loves to be held. I set her tank up in one of the rooms downstairs. When my fiance(28F) and I decided that we were ready to move in together, I slowly introduced her to the snake. She thought the snake was really cool and even held her a few times. A few months ago, her friends came over and ever since, she has been asking me to find a new home for the snake. 

I had to travel to another state for work and trusted her to take care of the snake. I was gone for a week and when I came back, I saw the tank completely gone. I searched all over the house and it was nowhere to be found. I went outside and check the wooded area behind the townhome and found the tank. The tank was open and no sign of the snake. When my fiance got home, I showed her the tank and told her to pack a suitcase and find another place to stay. Her defense was that I was giving the snake too much attention. Fiance is currently staying with her parents, and they think that I am overreacting over an animal. Fiance is upset that I won't talk to her or accept her apology.

She knew when she moved in that you love critters and had a snake. 

She betrayed your trust. 

It's pathetic to be jealous of a pet.

 It's absolutely monstrous to dump a pet , in so many ways. 

Setting up a snake habitat isn't cheap,  so she left a decent stack of your money out in that wooded area,  along with your snake.

Finally,  it sounds like her friends hold a little too much influence - your python was growing on her until her friends visited. 

Make the break permanent and let all the local shops that handle herps know about your missing snake.

AITA for having a snack?,"For background, I'm recovering from an eating disorder. Part of my recovery means that if I'm hungry, I need to eat. I need to get used to responding to hunger by eating. If I don't eat when I'm hungry it can become a habit, and I could relapse. I know that's hard for a lot of people to understand, but it's the best way I can explain it. I always carry snacks to accommodate this.

My boyfriend asked me to go to a family event with him at his aunt's house. Dinner was at 6:30, but the gathering started at four and we were on time. Around 5:30 I started to feel hungry, so I ate a small granola bar from my purse to reinforce the eat when you're hungry rule. Dinner was at 6:30 and excellent.

When we left my boyfriend was upset. He said I offended his family by eating a snack before dinner was served and implied they were bad hosts. He said I should have waited. I reminded him that I have to eat when I'm hungry. He said dinner was in an hour and should have been sufficient to enforce the rule, but it doesn't work that way. I have to eat as soon as I realize I'm hungry or it's a slippery slope that could lead to me going days without food.

Boyfriend was angry and accused me of just wanting attention and being inconsiderate. Should I have waited? Was I being too rigid?

Update: We broke up. We had a long talk about what happened, and he couldn't acknowledge that I know what's best for my recovery. He said relationships are about compromise. I said that doesn't apply to my health. He said it applies to everything. I said we should give each other space. Thank you everyone.

AITA for having a photo of my son's dna test framed and hanging in the living room?,"



I m32 met my wife 3 years ago. We got married 9 months ago. We have a baby boy together that she got pregnent with while we were engaged. My wife used to be a s_x worker. No judgement on that please! She did what she had to do to survive. My parents were always being ""skeptical"" about her and lot of times asked if I wanna settle down with her. When she got prengnent, they went nuts and demanded a dna test. They refused to attend the wedding til the dna test was done which caused a huge problem.


They ended up missing the wedding obviously. The test was done BECAUSE my wife wanted to prove a point and eventually my parents made ammends and we reconciled.


They started visiting and yesterday noticed the photo of the dna test that I hang in the living room. They asked about it and I told that it serves as a reminder for why they didn't attend my wedding, they were stunned and livid when I mentioned that I tell any guest the same thing I told them. Mom and dad were mad and asked me repeatedly to take it down saying I'm being too harsh on them and refusing to let go of the past as well as embarrassing them to the other family members. I refused to take it down and I admit being sarcastic in my response saying ""it goes with the hoise decor!.""


They begged then refused to come over anymore til I remove it. My brother thinks it's petty and childish and said I should take it down.


Alright I'm editing some stuff in. First of all, my wife does not mind having the photo up , she laughs about it sometimes but she's still carrying some hurt that was caused by what happened. And second of all, no, she no longer does s_x work it's all in the past.

I refused and then we had an argument and I just walked out.

AITA for telling my sister to stop taking showers with her husband in my house?,"
My f32, sister f28, and her husband m32 moved in with us 2 days ago after they lost their apartment to medical debts for their child (my nephew). My husband and I are more than happy to have them stay for few weeks til they get this resolved.


However, Yesterday at 7pm, I was in the kitchen when my husband rushed in and said that he saw both my sister and her husband walk out of the bathroom. They'd most likely taken a shower together. My husband said that it irked him and I agreed that what they did was somewhat inappropriate. He asked me to speak to my sister on the matter and I did. She got defensive asking how this is affecting me or my husband in any way. I told her that it made my husband feel uncomfortable and would rather that they just take their showers seperately. She started ranting about being overwhelmed by their son's health problems and not having some alone time together as a married couple and found this activity as a bonding time to spend together. I apologized for how she felt but requested that she just do as asked. She got mad at me and said that I was being inconsiderate and she didn't understand my husband's hangup on what she and her husband do. We started arguing and she stormed off to the guests room where my nephew and BIL are.

Husband used to help for the first 3 months with evenings but has since said he’s too busy/tired from work so I do it. I talked him through baby’s routine, the room temp, lighting, noise etc preferences he has and husband assured me he had everything under control.

He texted me to come home and put baby to bed. I told him I was sure he had everything in hand and put my phone on DND. I did periodically check on baby via the monitor and he was okay once husband actually followed the sleep routine.

AITA for having my husband fired?,"Can't believe I'm posting here but here I go.

I (29f) have an ex (34m), ""Richard"". Its been 3 years since we separated due to him being abusive and cheating, but we are not divorced as divorce is expensive in my country and whenever I apply for divorce Richard insists on meditation, so divorce is not granted as ""one of us tries to save the marriage"". He lives with his mistress and they have kid together that was conceived when we were still together. Due to both of them harassing and abusing me, I have a restraining order against both of them. My employer is aware of all of this as the utility company my ex works for supplies the buildings their offices are at (one of the major suppliers in the country)

Now to the actual events:

Due to restrictions everyone is currently working from home with a few days in the office. Richard decided to show up at my work with his kid and demanded to see me for ""child support"" money since we are still legally married. As my employer is aware of the situation, the reception refused to tell him if I'm in the office or not (I was) and asked Richard to leave. Richard did not and security was called. As he was with his child, security couldn't use force to remove Richard, so reception threatened to call the utility company he works for. Richard didn't believe the reception can do it, so long story short him and his mistress were fired with immediate effect as Richard showing up at my work has been seen as gross misconduct and they discovered Richard was his mistress boss (apparently his employer didn't know they were together and its strictly forbidden to have a relationship with someone who is directly employed by you). The utility company apologised for Richards actions and and gave a considerable discount for their services to make sure the news of what happened wouldn't spread.

Since they were fired I'm getting calls from unknown numbers of various Richards/his mistress family members and friends saying I'm responsible for it and just a jealous asshole for getting them fired to get Richard back. We still have some friends in common and they believe him getting fired and loosing the only source of income they have is too harsh and I should of prevented that/shouldn't have spoken in the beginning about what happened.

Aita?

Edit: just not to repeat myself in the comments. His family believes it's okay to have several partners and be responsible for kids even they are from affair. And according to our friends in common he spreads a lie that I couldn't get pregnant (I don't want and never wanted kids) so his mistress helped us with that, but then I ""overreacted"" and called it cheating, so he had to stay with her to support the kid. Its the same as what he pulled in the court when we were getting divorce alongside with his ""I still love her and should of communicated better"" lies. So the court wouldn't grant a divorce as they believe he is trying to save the marriage and I'm being unreasonable.

Edit 2: thank you for the support, I'm getting a bit overwhelmed trying to reply to everyone, but just want to point out few things.
His family beliefs are not normal for the country and I'm pretty sure they change if the situation would be other way round. 
My boss is also incredibly frustrated with the situation, so he gave me contacts of his friend who happens to be a family lawyer, who agreed to help me out at a discounted rate as he owes my boss a few favours. He sees why courts take that long and will try his best to make sure divorce is granted. He also works as no win no fee and believes we can win the case and get Richard to cover outstanding fees.
And most importantly no, I have not been paying child support to him and was not instructed to. The bit of claiming the child is mine as his mistress is a ""surrogate "" can be a bit complicated, but ""mister lawyer who I now owe a beer"" said courts can't make me pay or accept it since there's no evidence of any agreement.",17857,s7q9a4,NTA.

AITA for telling my sister she could’ve dated the guy she liked had she not been such a misogynistic pick me?,"My (20F) sister Kim and I are identical twins. We were very different growing up and still are. I hate to say this but Kim is the definition of a pick me girl, always spewing misogynistic nonsense on how women are weak and should abide to men. How she’s so short and petite so she can’t do anything on her own without a big strong man around. How all the girls are trying too hard by wearing makeup while she is pretty naturally so they all hate her for it. You get the gist. 

Kim and I attend the same college but study there in different departments. In one of my classes there is this guy named Dave, Dave is your typical handsome frat boy that most girls in our college have a crush on including Kim.

Over the summer I’ve started working in a small coffee shop near campus to earn some extra cash. During that time Dave became a frequent customer there and was pretty friendly toward me since he recognized me from class. After a while he admitted that he’s attracted to me and asked me out so we can get to know each other. Knowing that Kim liked him I decided to reject Dave and instead offered to set him up with her, we are identical so if he asked me out based on attraction it really shouldn’t matter. Dave agreed and I gave him my sisters number. 

I knew they met up for a date during the weekend but didn’t have the time to ask Kim how it went since I was sick. Today during my shift Dave approached me and asked if I could return to Kim the lipgloss she left in his car since he knew the brand was expensive. I asked him why he didn’t return it to her himself and he said that he didn’t want to see her after how the date went. 

I was confused and so I asked him if the date was really that bad. He explained that they went to a nice restaurant where my sister didn’t stop harassing and criticizing the waitress for wearing too much make up and looking “easy”. After that fiasco was over she proceeded to say some stuff that I can only imagine are usually said in an Andrew Tate podcast. Dave who was apparently raised by a single mother and has 5 sisters was horrified so he excused himself to the bathroom, paid for their meal, venmod Kim some cash for an Uber and left her at the restaurant alone.

I was embarrassed for Kim but totally understood why Dave walked out on her so I apologized on her behalf and took the lipgloss with me. I returned it to her 2 hours ago and she didn’t stop complaining on how awful Dave was, how he wasn’t a real man since real man usually like when she brings up how women are inferior to them. At some point I just cut her off and told her that she had a chance of a nice date with a guy she liked but ruined it all because she couldn’t stop being a misogynistic pick me even for one second. 

I’m now back at my apartment and Kim hasn’t stopped texting me demanding I apologize but I don’t feel like it. AITA?

Update: 

I would like to start this off by saying that although I don’t agree or excuse Kim’s actions I do understand that they come from a place of insecurity. And although I knew her obsession over male validation was not normal I didn’t understand the severity of it until now. I’ve talked with our parents and they both agreed based on what I told them that we’ll try to convince Kim to attend therapy after the holidays. I’m not she’ll agree but it’s worth a shot.

I ended up getting Dave’s phone number from a classmate of ours. I’ve sent him a text apologizing again for what went on and thanked him for still paying for my sisters meal and making sure she had a away to get home safely. We talked a bit more, one thing led to another and we agreed to meet up for lunch next week after class. I don’t know if I should consider this a date or not since we didn’t label it as such but I think I’ll just meet him there and see how it goes. 

I told Kim about it and to say she was pissed would be an understatement, she called me a horrible sister for agreeing to meet a guy who publicly humiliated her by leaving her alone at the restaurant. I retaliated by reminding her that she was the one who embarrassed him first by causing a scene in public. She was also the one who said that he’s not manly enough for her and lost all interest, so she can’t say she has a claim to him. After calming her down she agreed with me and said that a female like her deserves a manlier alpha male (yes, I know this sounds super cringy). I didn’t know what to say to that so I just laughed and wished her good luck with that. I think she’s still a bit salty over this and her ego is definitely bruised but at least I know she’s completely over Dave. 

I want to thank everyone for your support and for the awards. I don’t think I’ll post another update here but if anything interesting happens next week with Dave I’ll make sure to update on my page.

AITA for denying my fiance's request to pay for his brother and his wife's IVF using my inheritance money?,"

I f32 have recently inherited money from my mom. she was only parent and losing her is beyond devastating. The money can barely be called inheritance because my mom and her family didn't have much but it's better than nothing. my fiance at first said I deserved it and have the right to do whatever I wanted with it.


However, he told his whole family about and then his infertile brother and his wife pulled him aside for a conversation. After that he started talking about ""wanting/needing"" a nephew/niece. basically hinting about his brother's infertility issues then flatout requested that I pay for his brother and wife's IVF treatment from my inheritence money. I was taken aback initially but then I declined. He got mad saying I was selfish because (1) He & I are blessed to never have issues with fertility. and (2) I literally have nothing to lose if I give them money....""easy money"" that I didn't work for. This upset me to the point where I lashed oit at him telling him to stop bothering and guilting me about it.

I denied the request as a final decision. but he got more agitated and went on a campaign to shame me for treating him as if he's not my future husband therefor gets say/right to my inheritance. and not giving a single crap about his family's issues.",17736,wni3bp,"NTA. You are not a bank. Your inheritance is yours. Hearing that you ""didn't work for"" your mother's death should really make you consider this relationship with your fiancé.

AITA for quietly packing my stuff and leaving my family’s house without telling anyone after my dad threatened to kick me out?,"I (23F) live at home. I am in grad school and work part time + intern at an office. I graduate in June and I’ve been applying to jobs as much as I can so I can finally move out. My sister (20F) also lives at home but is doing school online and doesn’t work, I try to help with chores around the house as much as possible, although it’s difficult since I leave the house early in the morning and come home late at night. Last week, I came home and there were clean dishes in the dishwasher, I said I’m gonna take a quick shower then empty the dishwasher and my dad went on a rant about how I’m useless and never help around the house and that my sister is always the one doing everything, I explained that I do help and that just because they haven’t seen me help doesn’t mean that I don’t, he asked me to give him an example and I told him that I took the garbage out the night before, the conversation escalated to him saying that I should shut up and not argue any longer because he can easily make me homeless if he wanted to. I said ok and went upstairs, the next morning while everyone was still asleep I packed my things and left and I’ve been sleeping in my car for a week and taking showers at my gym, later in the day after I left my parents called and my mom texted me asking where I am when I didn’t come home when I was supposed to, I didn’t reply and blocked my entire family’s numbers and social media’s and haven’t spoken to them since. They have been calling and texting my friends asking them where I am, I haven’t told any of my friends that I’m sleeping in my car so I got very confused texts from friends asking me what’s going on and why my parents are asking where I am and if I’m safe and ok, I told my closest friend that I left home and that I’m safe and let her know to tell my parents that I’m fine but I have no desire to speak to them anymore. They’ve been begging my friend to disclose my location and asking her to ask me to allow them to speak to me. I went to my friends yesterday and she told me that what I did was awful and that I should speak to them, I told her that they threatened to make me homeless so I left by my own volition but she’s insisting that making them worry about my safety is a horrible thing to do but I honestly think I just gave them what they asked for, they wanted to get rid of me so I left. AITA for leaving and refusing to communicate with them?

Edit: my mom was there when this happened and she was on my dads side as well so she’s aware of the incident and knows that I was threatened to be made homeless, they also said that I was most likely never going to get a job and was going to stay at home forever even though I have 2 jobs rn (internship is unpaid though) and I’m actively looking for a full time job and yes they’ve done this before

AITA for not paying for my neighbors child's medical bills?,"We bought our new house last year. When we first viewed the house, we noticed bikes and children's toys in the driveway and on the side yard. At our final walkthrough before we signed the final documents and got the keys, we noticed kids in the driveway coloring with sidewalk chalk and riding scooters and bikes. We introduced ourselves to the kids and asked where they lived, they pointed at the house next door. After the walkthrough, my SO and myself went to the house the kids pointed out and introduced ourselves to the parents and let them know we were buying the house and would be moving in, we also mentioned that with the trucks coming and us moving things in and out, it was not safe to have the kids in the driveway.

All was fine when we moved in, the kids didn't play in the driveway, but they were still leaving toys and digging in the side yard. We went over and asked the neighbors to please have the kids clean the toys up and stop digging in the yard. The mother said that Mr. and Mrs. X (previous owners) always let the kids try and dig for fossils in the yard and laughed. We said that we were not Mr. and Mrs. X and that we did not want the kids digging or playing in our yard. Then they started up with the bikes in the driveway again. We have cameras facing the front of the house and saw that they would ride in the driveway and the yard, and they were also starting to draw again with the chalk. We again went over to the neighbors house and let them know we did not want the kids playing in our driveway, our yard or drawing on it with chalk. The neighbor again said that Mr. and Mrs. X always let them do it, and again we explained that we were not Mr. and Mrs. X and we did not want them to do this. We also followed this up with a letter to the neighbors and informed that the kids were not allowed to play, dig or draw on our property and sent it certified mail.

Fast forward to Sunday. My SO is in the house and I am in the garage cutting wood for some projects.  I pulled my truck out of the garage so that I could work. About 20 minutes in, I hear the neighbors kids laughing in the driveway so I went out to see what they were doing. They were riding bikes on the driveway. I told them to please not ride their bikes on the driveway and go on home. Not five minutes after I said that I heard the kids again, and then heard a scream. One of the kids rode his bike straight into the truck. The neighbor came out screaming at me accusing me of causing this, the other kid told her that wasn't true and that Kid rode right into the car. My SO came out to see what the commotion was and the neighbor started screaming at SO that we would regret this.

Last night, the father came to our house and said that we are responsible for the medical bills from Kid getting hurt. I told him we are not responsible and that his kids should not even be in our yard.

AITA for not paying the medical bills?

**Update:**

**My SO and I have read every comment and decided to get proactive. We viewed the camera footage from the day of the incident, and it does show me on camera telling the kids to go home and not play on the driveway. It does show the kid riding the bike on the driveway, but unfortunately the way the truck was parked, it did not pick up the kid riding into it. It picked up the sound, but no video. It did however, pick up the other kid telling the mom that the kid rode into the truck. SO called our homeowners insurance company and informed them of the incident. The agent we deal with asked for us to send him copies of the certified letter/receipt and video of the incident. He says that as far as our insurance is concerned, if they do call and try to claim, they will fight it. He too suggested that we go to the police so we went there this afternoon. We took copies of the letter and video and showed it to the officer who took the report. He said that the neighbors have been fairly warned that they are not welcome on our property and asked if we wanted them trespassed, we said yes. The officer said that another patrol officer would go there this afternoon and speak with the family and let them know that they have been trespassed from our property. After the police left, the father went on a profanity laced tirade in the yard, calling myself and my SO some very choice names. Again while there is no video, it is recorded by the camera. We will be getting new cameras that show that portion of the driveway.**

AITA for wanting to tell my husband's sister where he takes her son whenever he's babysitting for her?,"Hear me out,


My husband's sister ""Nicole"" had a difficult upbringing, her parents kicked her out and disowned her and cut financial support off her after she refused to marry the family friend. She instead went to live with her late boyfriend who passed away shortly after their son was born. My inlaws kept pressuring Nicole to let them meet their grandkid, they harassed her to the point where she got a restraining order against them and that's when they stopped. But they, including my husband, have been complaining about what a horrible thing she did and said that she broke the family and robbed them of their grandchild. My husband has contact with Nicole and he started offering to babysit her son for her after she finally found found new job, and she's been grateful for this.

However, he's been doing this eversince he started babysitting his nephew, He'd wait til she drop his nephew off then he'd get him into the car and drive to my inlaws house so they could see him. He'd stay gone and come back 30 minutes before Nicole is expected to arrive. I didn't wanna say anything first but then I couldn't stand thinking about how betrayed and hurt Nicole would feel if she found out. I told my husband what he's doing is wrong since his nephew's mom did not consent to him go to my inlaws house, but he told me he's doing this for his nephew's sake and told me to shut the f up and stay out of his family affairs. This caused an argument between us, I told him if he doesn't stop then I'd tell Nicole, he said I wouldn't then explained that he didn't think it was fair for Nicole to punish his parents like that and ban them from seeing their grandchild - I told him  this is serious cause she has a restraining order against them and our nephew's shouldn't be there. I insisted I'd tell her if this doesn't stop but he said if i do that I'd cost him to lose his nephew and called me bitter and cruel for even entertaining the idea. He told me if I do that then he'll let my inlaws know and they won't be happy with me. He urged me to mind my own business and stop trying to divide the family and ""condon"" Nicole's unjustified hatred for his parents.",17696,teb8kf,"NTA, please please please tell your sister-in-law!

AITA for making my daughter share her presents with my stepdaughter?,"I (40f) was a single mother to my daughter, Amy (15f). I came out 3 years ago and married my wife Jenna (42f) last year. She has a daughter, Nora (13f). We all live together as I have full custody of my daughter. It was kind of hard for her to adjust to having a second mom, but they got along well.

The girls have their birthdays very close, only two days apart, so we decided to have a joint birthday party for both of them, since Nora had a hard time making new friends (they moved in with us and she's very shy). Most of my family lives out of the country, so the gifts were sent a week early. It was a huge bag, with at least 20 gifts. The party was nice and we opened the bag at night once everyone left.

Jenna handed out the presents as she took them out. After 12 gifts in a row just for Amy, I checked the bag and froze to see that there was only one gift for Nora, from my parents. She pretended it wasn't a big deal, but as she opened the present I saw her eyes drop. It was a $15 tumbler from Walmart. Not to sound ungrateful, but Amy's gifts were much more expensive (lots of gift cards over $100, a new phone, limited-edition Funkos, designer clothes and lots of cards wishing her a happy birthday).

Needless to say, I blew up the family chat, calling out my parents, siblings, and extended family who sent gifts for not considering Nora and my parents for the cheap gift. No one took me seriously since: *""It's not our duty to give gifts to someone else's kid""* and *""Amy deserved them, since I didn't even throw her her own birthday party"",* emphasizing that Jenna and Nora are my problem, not theirs.

Nora was clearly hurt, since it's not the first time my family has left her out. At night, I asked Amy to share some of the gifts with her stepsister. Not all of them, just a couple of gift cards and some of the new clothes. Amy refused. This surprised me, since she never had a problem with sharing and even though she and Nora are not BFF's, they usually get along. After asking why, Amy started crying, saying that she never wanted a joint birthday party, and that I force her to share everything with Nora. They share a room for space and I make sure they're both invited to the same parties and sleepovers, so that Nora won't be left out. If they don't invite both of them, then either of them goes.

Amy stated that she at least wanted her own gifts to be hers alone. I scolded her for being selfish with her stepsister, grounded her and took a couple of the presents to give to Nora. She turned them down because she didn't want problems with Amy and it felt like pity. Since then, Amy has been cold to all of us. I just wanted my two girls to be closer with the joint party and have the same things. AITA?

Clarification: Jenna and I bought gifts for the girls (their own tablets), as well as their friends. Nora also received gifts from her extended family, but they sent for Amy as well.",17698,wtcwc5,"YTA absolutely 

You’re trying to force this one big happy family dynamic. You expect your family to jump on board pretty quickly and just accept and treat Nora like your own and they haven’t.

You don’t solve that by stealing your daughters presents from her family and sharing them with Nora, that’s only going to build resentment between them.

You’ve found who you are and accepted it and created a new life, good for you. But in the process you’ve robbed your daughter of her own space, her own celebrations, her own friendships and her own gifts. Then you punish her for not being accepting of it.

AITA for giving a very silly ugly smile in meetings after my boss said I should smile more?,"I work in a tech consulting job, I'm the only woman on the team.. and my boss told me I was coming off ""harsh"" with clients and should be more upbeat and smile more. It felt... Ick

I right away texted my group chat of coworkers (without the management in it) asking ""has BossMan ever told any of you guys to smile more?'

It was an immediate round of no's, and a couple of my coworkers asked if he said that to me and pointed out the double standard. A few of my coworkers joked that some of the clients we have right now don't give them anything to smile about. 

So then I asked if any of them had ever been called harsh, and it was again all nos. 

I told them that the boss had told me to smile more, and one of my coworkers sent me a picture of a girl pulling a silly face with a weird pinched smile and bug-out eyes saying ""well what BossMan says, he gets"" 

I thought that was hilarious and decided to actually do it.

Anyway, I started smiling more and more around my boss... But also a bit stupidly. Just keeping my mouth pinched tensely, gums on display, and purposely pulling my chin back towards my neck so I'd get a double chin. 

I never did it in front of actual clients, just my boss and coworkers who were in on the joke. And my boss kept looking uncomfortable when I did. 

He asked me at a meeting about a week in what that face I was pulling was. I said ""Uhh what face"" He said ""That one, just a second ago"" and my coworker said ""What, she was just smiling? What are you getting at her for?"" 

My boss said""It looked like she was pulling a face"" and my other coworker pulled out his phone where he had some pictures from a recent happy hour where I was pulling that face to make my coworkers laugh. And he said ""Dude, what the hell is wrong with you, that's literally her smile? Look at this picture from last Friday"" and all of my coworkers backed him up saying that was just how I smile. 

My boss was looking kinda incredulous so I clarified that if something makes me spontaneously laugh or grin, it probably looks a little more relaxed, but when I'm just putting on a smile to be polite or pose for a picture, I guess that's how I smile. And I was trying to be polite after he let me know I was coming off ""harsh"" in meetings.

Anyway, at my next one on one meeting, my boss said I didn't need to change my demeanor that much based on his comments, because honestly it was coming off disengenous and that would look worse in front of clients. 

I just said ""Yeah, I guess I've never really been good at being super peppy without it looking fake.""

And as far as I know, that was the end of that. Except for it becoming a running joke at the offce that I look like Nigel Thornberry. Which is a pretty smashing nickname honestly. 

But I feel a little bad that I basically gaslit my boss and my coworkers were in on it instead of being direct with him and just saying that he was coming across a bit sexist.

AITA for going off on my husband and his mom for taking/keeping my used pregnancy test?,"
I (f27) found out I was pregnant very recently, My husband (m34) and his family are beyond happy and excited. from what I heard my husband was married 2 times before but couldn't have kids for 10 years. This is obviously a huge deal for his family because his mom will be a first time grandma with this baby.


They threw a celebration dinner for us and as his mom and I were talking about the baby. She told me about how she already started ""making memories"" started having ""keepsakes"" of her grandbaby. I felt a bit confused and asked if my husband bought something for the baby and gave it to her. She said no but he did bring her my used pregnancy test and gave it to her to store as a ""memory"" of the news of her grandbaby's exisistance. I was floored. I looked at my husband like ""did you really do that?"" and he nodded while smiling. NGL I felt creeped out, disgusted and very uncomfortable.

After the initial shock I just went off on both of them calling what they did creepy and disgusting and highly violating. My husband argued that it was not a huge deal, he just grabbed the test once I got rid of it, put it in a plastic bag and ""gifted"" it to his mom as ""keepsake"". I told him it made me feel violated and creeped out because that test had my literal pee on it. His mom then said something about ""taking care"" of the smell and I lashed out even more and demanded they get rid of it but they kept arguing calling me controlling. BIL asked me to calm down but I decided to just grab stuff and go home. My husband started arguing about how this is all just an overreaction and said that I ruined his and his family's joy by how I behaved after finding out about the pregnancy test. He said for him and his mom it's all about the baby but I somehow made this whole thing about me and hurt their feelings in the process. But that was my literal pee on that test and I just couldn't help but flip out even if it ruined their joy for the news.

AITA for calling the police on my coworker over a prank?,"Throwaway acct and sorry for formatting on mobile.

I (25f) just started this new job as a front desk clerk at a hotel. I work the over night shift. I usually have a coworker (30sM) with me but he never really spoke to me. A few nights ago was my first night alone. At around 2am, I notice a person in the parking lot (you can see the lot from the front desk. The lighting in the lot is terrible so you don't really see faces until they get close to the lobby door.) just standing there not moving for about five to ten minutes. I thought this was strange and of course it creeped me out. After about 10 minutes of them standing there, they moved I guess to call the front desk because he moved his hand to his ear and the phone rang. I picked up and on the other end I just heard ""5 buried. None found."" in a low voice and then they hung up. At this point I was terrified so I ran to the back room and called 911. I explained to the operator about what had been going on and they sent a couple cops to the hotel. When they arrived, one cop was talking to the person outside and the other one was at the front desk talking to me telling me that the person outside was claiming that he also worked here. I was confused but also admitted i hadn't seen the persons face just the silhouette. At this point the other officer and the person from the lot come in and it turns out to be my coworker and he was upset saying he would have never pranked me if he knew I was going to call the police and try to get him arrested. I didn't go through with pressing charges but I did tell my manager what happened the next morning. It's been a few days now and I guess he told other coworkers what happened and now no one is really speaking to me and giving me a bit of an attitude.

AITA for cancelling the family vacation because my husband gave our kids tickets to his widowed cousin's kids?,"
Me (f33) and my husband Chris (m36) planned a one week vacation to an out of state ski resort with our 2 kids. His cousin Martin (m38) lost his wife to cancer 6 months ago. She left behind 2 kids nearly same age as my kids (6 &9). My husband is devestated for his best friend's loss, (they're so close that he sees him as a friend) understandably so. He tries to help Martin and kids. But in my opinion? he's been doing a little too much for them lately.

He suggested we take Martin's kids with us to the resort to get their mind off the grief a bit. I apologized and said it won't wouldn't since we barely have budget to cover for our kids. He insisted then tried offering compromises but I still said it wouldn't work. He was obviously pissed but dropped it eventually.


2 days before the trip, I found out that my husband booked two tickets for Martin's kids instead of our own kids. I was the one paying but he insisted on handling thd booking and making reservations. I was stunned...I called him out on it and he apologetically talked about how Martin needs some alone time away from the kids, how the kids need a breather, and how they need this vacation more than our kids do. I flipped out at him asking if he seriously ok with prioritizing others':kids over his own. He said it wasn't about priorities but doing what's needed to help those kids out. I asked how his own kids will react once they find out but he said ""I'm sure they'd understand"". I said no and decided to cancel the vacation altogether. He freaked out on me saying I can't do that and make him look small infront of his cousin and family since they praised him for this ""nice gesture"". I refused to negotiate it but he called me horribly selfish and cruel towards grieving kids and said that he'll make sure our own kids know how I'm behaving towards the other kids by robbing them of the fun they so much need and deserve.


We haven't been talking and he's so pissed and keeps throwing a fit after a fit about it. Claiming I ruined it for everybody when I cancelled.

AITA for not correcting my son when he told his step father/my husband off?,"I have been married to my husband Jeremy since my son ""Chris"" was 8. He is now 17. My husband and him have a fantastic relationship, despite what the title may sound like.

My birthday is in 2 weeks and I honestly havent put much thought in to it. My husband is not a gift giver. He says he has a hard time figuring out what to get and doesnt want to waste money on something that people wont use. He is also a practical person, whereas I'm by far the sentimental type. So even when he does get me something, it's something I can use every day. Which, no big deal obviously, but I've requested some sentimental pieces and he just never gets them. So I pretty much gave up on ever asking for anything and it did really bother me for a number of years but it truly doesnt bother me now usually. 

Well, my son graduated a year early and doesnt start college until next year. So currently he works 2 jobs (his choice). I've asked him to cut back and enjoy his teen years before adulthood but working just makes him happy. So he works at a mechanic shop and a junk yard. Most of his buddies work there too so at least he is getting in time with friends. Well my husband hates spending money and tries inflicting that on us. He lives as frugally as physically possible and saves every single dime that he can. He could retire right this second and wouldnt be able to go through all the money he has saved.

My son comes home last night with 3 of his buddies that work with him and hes like ""I know it's not for 2 more weeks but I cant wait for you to open this, so please open it now."" Him and his buddies are snickering about it so I thought it would be some gag gift but much to my surprise, it was a huge, absolutely gorgeous wall piece that has photo frames AND shelves built in. My husband immediately was like ""Wow, how much did that cost? That could have went into a IRA Ros account"" (idk if I said that right). My son immediately shots cold daggers at my husband and says ""Its truly none of your business what I do with my money and since you outright refuse to buy my mother nice things that she absolutely deserves, I will make sure she gets something nice. And for the record, we made this ourselves. Didnt cost us anything."" My husband just stops talking, looks at me waiting for me to say something and when I dont he shakes his head and walks off. After the boys leave he says I allowed Chris to embarass him infront of other people and I should have said something. I simply told him that Chris was right.

I broke curfew a few days ago and she suggested that she is considering whether to take 20% of my money out of the account as a fine for punishment and every time this happens she will take 20% more until nothing is left.

I was very upset about her threat and decided that I should move my money before she takes it away. I logged in online and transferred all of it to my big brother's account that night and the next day we went to open a joint bank account with my brother and we moved the money there. So she doesn't have access to it anymore.

So upon learning what happened my dad and step mom are furious at me (and my brother). Step mom is focused on the fact that I've taken away her means of punishment and my dad is upset that I didn't trust him enough to protect my money (he insists he wouldn't have allowed it). Step mom has banned me from seeing my brother (it's meaningless, I don't accept her authority to do this) and my dad says he's hurt that I didn't trust him and as a result he doesn't trust me anymore. 

AITA for moving the money?",17563,xm3ubj,"NTA! Your stepmom has wildly overstepped, and good on you for having the foresight to take preventative measures to protect YOUR hard-earned money. Where was your dad when she first brought this up? Did he defend you? Especially since he disagrees with your stepmom, his issue should be with her for crossing the line, not with you for being smart about your money.",5964,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xm3ubj/aita_for_moving_my_money_to_a_different_account/
AITA for making my younger sisters fly home early after they followed my husband?,"I have two younger sisters who are 15 and 17. They came to visit my husband and I on what was supposed to be a 5-week trip. Unfortunately, it had to end early after they were caught following my husband while he was having dinner with a client.

I told them they had to leave immediately because I could tell my husband was close to exploding and even though they kept begging me to hear them out and to let them stay I wouldn’t. I called our dad to let him know they would be coming home early and why which didn’t go over well. My stepmother wanted me to let them stay until the morning so they would fly back in the daytime but I told her it wasn’t possible and they had to leave immediately. 

I’m supposed to be visiting soon but my sisters have told our dad that they don’t want to see me and my stepmother said I wasn’t welcome in her house after what I did to them.

The reason my husband was so angry is because the client was the one who noticed them taking pictures of them and when he confronted them they were rude to her and to him.

AITA for leaving the hospital after my husband called for his mom instead of me?,"
My husband (31) was in the hospital for a surgery that involved anesthesia. His mom came to wait with me there but didn't speak to me because we have been having some minor disagreements. She offered me coffee but I declined politely. 

Hours after the surgery, we were told only one person goes into the room for the day since he was still under anesthesia. From what I understand he woke up calling for his mom, the nurse asked for his mom to go in and she did. I was irritated and felt like all this waiting and stressing out got ignored. The nurse told me that he was still not fully awake and was repeatedly calling for his mom spontaneously, she was basically hinting that I shouldn't get worked up over a natural reaction from my husband but I couldn't help feel irked. I wanted to go home so I left 10 minutes later. His mom called saying she got out the room after I left so I could get time with him but instead I couldn't wait and went home. She said this was not okay and I flew off the handle for no reason, I said that her son acted like I wasn't there but she said that he can not be blamed for something he can't control and I'm just being unfair to him and putting blame on him because of a disagreement between her and I. I cut the conversation short after I sensed that she somehow blamed me for being unacknowledged and ignored. Her husband texted later saying I'm being hostile over nothing and that I should focus on my husband's health instead of acting petty but I don't think I did anything that qualifies as petty.",17552,twx0ue,"YTA. I'm a nurse anaesthetist and:
1. people have no idea what they say when they wake up from anaesthesia and even a pretty while after 
2. It's perfectly normal and fine for patients to call for their moms when they feel sick, are in pain etc. Dying patients usually call for their mothers, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that since our mothers are (usually) the ones taking the most care of us and we all carry them deeply in our hearts.

AITA for telling my brother that his looks aren't the reason women run from him?,"I (22M) have three older siblings, Diana (43F), Sebastian (37m) and Jake (32M), I was the surprise baby and I'm closer to Jake than Diana or Sebastian.

Now, Jake has always been interested in sports and all, training since he was 14 and went pro in college, so even at 32 he looks like a young Schwarzenegger and I took after him because he was the sibling at home who I was actively watching, I mean I was young and *desperate* for interacting with my siblings, so I did a lot of needy things, I took baking classes with Diana, I watched every stupid Star Wars movie so I could talk to Sebastian and I became The Rock at 18 for Jake.

I'm not that needy anymore, and I never really talked with Sebastian, he claims the reason people (and mostly women) reject him are his looks, I mean he's okay, a little bald a little overweight, but also very very grumpy and noisy. He thinks Jake and I are stupid just because of how we look (he really doesn't have another reason, Jake has a PhD and I'm top of my classes, but we're stupid because MuScLeS). I've been laughing at his disrespect and resent for years, but now that I'm a bit older, I just cut him off and move away from him, it's sad because he's my brother and I want a relationship, but meh.

I was in an OR with a guy and a girl because I don't want anything serious in my 20s, and a few months ago, my girl had to pick me up form my parents house and I ''introduced her'' to my family, next day she said that Sebastian sent her the most *unfckable* messages on fb she has ever received in her life, I read it and it was something... he called her beautiful, he said he knew we weren't serious or official and asked her on a date, 20 min later he asked if she was there, 10 minutes later he asked her not to show me the text, and 10 minutes later he spent the next 20 minutes insulting her until she blocked him. We agreed to not tell him anything because she said she didn't cared and that was all.

I broke up with them and removed myself from the house, I'll be living with my parents for at least a month until I find another apartment, Sebastian is also living here and when I went trough the door, he laughed at me, calling me a ''kicked out Chad'' and that even when I look ''like a little Jake'' I still got broken up with and now I know how he feels when people reject him for his looks, but that ''it's better'' because my looks are the ''fuckboy stereotype'' and I just rolled my eyes and said that his looks aren't the reason women run form him but rather his creepy personality and to remember the texts he sent to \[my ex\] a few months ago. He got red in the face and my mom said that I was rude because Sebastian is already having a bad time being his age and living at home.",17547,us54zm,"Lmao NTA.

AITA for calling my stepmother delusional for thinking I would change my mind on her adopting me?,"My mom died when I was 6 years old. My dad ended up turning to one of his good friends, Ana, and they ended up getting married when I was 7. Ana brought up the idea of adopting me the day of the wedding. It was something my dad was all for but I went nuts when she mentioned it to me and I kinda spoiled the rest of the wedding. For the next year we did this really intense therapy where I was told over and over again, by the therapist and them, that I needed a mom, that it would provide safety for me, and that it was not a betrayal of my mom to accept another loving mom into my life. The therapist put the recommendation into the court to approve it, but when the judge spoke to me, I told him that I would run away, and that I would do everything to never come back. I was 8 at the time and meant business. He asked me why I didn't want to be adopted. He listened. And when he addressed the court again he denied the adoption request and told my dad and Ana that until I was on board no adoption would be approved in his court.

They did try again, requesting a different judge, but received the same response.

I was asked constantly to change my mind. Ana would put her all into trying to fill the place of a mom in my life. Every time I told her she could never be my mom she took it as a challenge to try harder, and better, and she would dedicate so much time to me it was crazy. I never appreciated it because instead of just being Ana, and instead of my dad telling her to just be Ana, she saw mom as the only thing she wanted. Even when she had kids of her own, I was their oldest son, I was her son, her boy, she'd call herself a boy mom, etc.

Whereas I have never called her mom. If we're being honest I don't even love her after all these years. I see her as more of an intrusive family member who won't stop. My relationship with my dad is also not the best because I don't like that he wouldn't take no for an answer, and that he was so quick to try and push an adoption. Even after I told him I would rather be with grandparents, or an aunt/uncle or close family friend to Ana if he died, he insisted being with Ana and her being my mom was the best for me.

I turned 18 a few months ago and I ran like my ass was on fire to get away from dad and Ana. I lived with my maternal grandparents for a little while before moving in with my maternal uncle who lived near a really good apprenticeship I wanted to join.

My paternal grandparents celebrated their wedding anniversary this past weekend and I was there. While there Ana approached me and handed me papers for an adult adoption. She told me she loved me and she wanted me to know it was not too late, that she would still adopt me and she wanted to make our relationship official as mother and son. I asked her how she could be so delusional when I have said no to being adopted for 11 years now. I told her I would not change my mind.

She and my dad were so pissed at my choice of words and chaos ensued at the party.

AITA?",17532,xxt860,"NTA, people need to learn what no means. The fact they tried to get another judge to ignore your wishes is the biggest one for me. You said no, so they hire a whole fucking therapist to convince you. You didnt say anything about needing therapy, so sounds like that was literally the only reason. Then when a whole ass judge tells them to chill out till you're okay with it, they just double down. You would think being embarassed at her own wedding woulda been enough, but she kept it up for 11 yrs?

AITA for calling out my stepbrother on his Instagram post and embarassing him?,"Throwaway because my friends know my main account.

I (M17) and my mum (F39) moved in with my step dad \[SD\] (M46) and step brother \[SB\] (M15) around two years ago.

So I have a nice sneaker collection that I have amassed through working a casual job and reselling sneakers. Now SB, who hasn't showed any interest in my sneaker collection previously, I guess is at the age now where it matters more. He has been coming into my room more often to have a look at the collection, and he has also recently grown into the same size as me... this is important.

Recently he has been asking me to let me wear some of the shoes in my collection. I'm opposed to this because:

1. They're my shoes. I feel like I should have the final say in who gets to wear them.
2. He is not careful and absolutely thrashes his shoes.
3. Common sense, but wearing a shoe decreases it's value significantly. I like to hold some unworn in case the price spikes.

So every time he's asked I've told him no. Recently he told me that he has a very important outing he's going to (he's just going out with friends) and wants to wear one of the shoes. I told him no, but this time he threw an absolute fit and got SD involved. SD told me that I'm being greedy and that I should just let SB wear one since I have so many. I told him that I value each and everyone of them and told him the resell value of the pair and SD was absolutely shocked. This devolved into an argument about me paying rent, when really I paid for the RETAIL price and not the RESELL price which he does not seem to understand. SD and SB left when they realised I wasn't budging.

I thought the situation was over. I headed off to work on Saturday. However, on the bus ride home I was scrolling through Instagram and SB posted a picture of himself wearing the exact shoe that I did not let him wear. I was so angry, and I commented ""Why the fuck are you wearing my shoes?"". He deleted my comment, but it seems like it was too late. Some of his friends saw, which embarrassed him because he had told them that the shoes were his. He told SD about what happened who called me in a fury asking me why did I have to embarrass his son like that, and that the shoes were worth fuck all. I yelled at him back that SB had no business wearing my stuff and I had the feeling that SD encouraged it to, so fuck the both of you and hung up.

When I got home I got full on yelled at. He told me that I should be lucky that I am allowed to live under this roof. My mum stepped in to defend me and now they have been arguing for the past day and a half. I asked SB to give me my shoes back and he did. I told him to never touch my shit again and have been holing it up in my room since.

Things are really tense in the house now.

AITA for telling my BIL it's cringe to continue saying he's child free whenever I ask him to watch my son?,"
My wife (27) and I (27) have a 4 year old son, we've been having an incredibly busy work schedule of the last 2 years and family's been doing a great job helping out with our son.

we usually have members of my inlaws take our son whenever we have a work trip or a shift coming up. from my wife's mom to her sister to her dad except for my 31 year old brother in law (wife's brother). He's made it clear he is just not interested in spending time with his nephew, keeps saying that the reason for that is that he's actually ""child free"". for so many emergencies he has turned me and my wife away when we begged him to watch our son  and he didn't even budge or apologize for his attitude.


it all came to head a couple of days ago, I had a work meeting while my wife was out of town and my inlaws were attending a wedding so no one was free to watch my son except for my BIL. I showed up to his place and told him I was desperate for help and needed him to just watch my son for 2 hours. he refused, even suggested I take him with me to work but that's not a good suggestion. I begged him and he just said no. I had enough I confronted him and asked why? does he not like his nephew and he threw that ""no it's just that I'm child free"" excuse which made me lose it. I told him to just stop because it's cringe of him to keep saying that and use it as an excuse to be unsupportive of me and his sister and cold towards his nephew. I told him he should really do better and stop being so negative but he got mad and said I had no right to disrespect his lifestyle/choices but it's the attitude that gets me. we had a exchange of words where he said my son isn't his responsibility whatsoever then I left.


he complained to my inlaws and they ""called me out"" for disrespecting their son and treating him like that. They insisted that he's not responsible for my son and I shouldn't expect so much from him then guilt him about it. they wanted me to apologize and my wife said I should but he was about as helpful and supportive as a rock so, I decided I will take my time before I consider apologizing.

AITA for not wanting strangers in the background of my wedding pics?,"I (24f) recently had my wedding on the beach of a beautiful hotel in Cancun. Many of my friends and family could go so I was very happy. The only problem was during our ceremony, there were people on the sea playing or doing jet ski activities. It really bothered me because they would appear in the background so I told my wedding planner about it. She was very understanding and said she would fix it.

When she talked to the owners of the activities and to the people in that area of the sea, we expected them to be kind and nice, but they just declined and continued. I even took the time to go myself and ask them to stop but they didn’t care.

I was about to go and tell someone from the hotel but my now husband stopped me and said it would be an AH thing to do. I told him standing up for myself wasn’t an AH thing to do and went looking for hotel staff, but they said there was nothing they could do.

AITA for leaving my boyfriend in Arizona after he pretended to push me over the edge of the Grand Canyon?,"Throwaway, first post, yada yada. Bad writing bc character limit.

I just went to the Grand Canyon with my BF. I’m 150% afraid of heights. Don’t go near windows/railings type of scared. Phobia in the full sense of the word. Bc of this, I didn’t want to go in the first place, but it’s a famous destination so I figured it was worth facing my fears.

I had multiple convos with my BF about my fears. At least 5 separate, in-depth convos about how scared I was about having a panic attack around strangers (I have a long history of panic attacks). He assured me he’d help me maintain my distance from ledges & calm me down if I got overwhelmed/scared.

We just went. We planned to do a tour then go out by ourselves in the following days. Well on day 1 on our tour, we stopped at a scenic lookout to take pictures & he decided it’d be funny to grab me & pretend to try & push me over the edge of the cliff. I immediately freaked out & (unsurprisingly) had a panic attack, all in front of our group while the poor guide tried to calm me down.

I’m not proud of how I acted, but I’ll tell you it wasn’t pretty. I was sobbing & yelling that he was cruel for doing this. That he knew I was terrified & he was evil for using that against me. He was yelling back that it was a joke, I was taking it too seriously, & to get over it bc I was embarrassing myself/him (which to be fair, I was..it was quite embarrassing).

I think I was the AH in this next part: I told him he was a horrible person & his ex was right to leave him. (Context: His ex left him bc she thought he was immature, but she left right before a “high profile” family event & embarrassed him among his family.) He yelled that was fucked up to say & in hindsight I think he’s right, especially since it was in public.

The tour guide separated us & took me back to their office & I have no idea what he did after that. He wasn’t in our hotel when I got my stuff & I got a flight to my parents’ state & I’ve been staying here while I figure out if this relationship is still alive. We live together & work for the same company, so if this is over my life is going to get very messy.

The thing is we have a ton of mutual friends & I have half of them texting/calling me to say I’m overreacting & being a “psycho bitch.” Besides my 3 closest friends, I haven’t told anyone anything, but bc they all know him too everyone has heard some version of events & they’re making it seem like I’m leading a PR campaign against him. I don’t have social media & haven’t said anything to anyone besides my best friends.

They’re particularly mad that I left him in Arizona. I don’t think what I did was worth all the hate I’m getting. I left him the rental car & hotel room & took an Uber to the airport, I paid for everything myself (including our hotel room), & I left a note in the room telling him I was going to my parents’.

Lauren made my life hell. Lauren badmouthed me, would miss pick up times and make decisions without talking to me. Her dad offered money to relinquish custody, I told him off. Ariel is now 19 and just started college. The deal was me and her mom would split it. 

I remarried Tori when Ariel was 6. Tori was a rock during the divorce but we didn’t date till 2 years later. Lauren used this to warp Ariel against Tori and our son (13M). She excludes them. Whenever she spends the night she will just talk to me or go to her room if my family was around. Our son walks to the basement if she comes over. It hurts me a lot.

‘We had Ariel too young, it was a huge struggle’ :

-Of course! Parenting is super hard even if you are prepared.  But you chose to have unprotected sex which could result in a baby, at an age before your brain was fully formed (age 25).

‘We moved into Laren’s family’s’ I was working multiple jobs’:

-Wow! How nice that your ex-wife’s parents took all 3 of you in - sounds supportive!  Working 3 jobs is hard!  Being a stay-home parent is hard too!  It sounds like you probably chose to be the bread-winner of the family, hey? 

‘Me and Lauren were best friends thru this, but things ended  when Ariel was 2.’ 
-An unfortunate side-effect of working 3 jobs is that you don’t get to spend time with your child or your wife! It sucks, but it is what it is.

‘Laren’s friend Tori told me that Laren had been messaging guys and giving them her number- I checked Lauren’s phone and found it.  I asked for a divorce.  Laren was pissed and wanted to reconcile. I didn’t and got split custody.’

- So your wife had an emotional affair, and you took your first opportunity to get out of your relationship!  Ok!  Sounds like you really wanted out!  No worries, you don’t have to do the personal work and spend effort on your relationship, that’s up to you!  (Your brain still wasn’t fully formed at this point).
- 
‘Lauren made my life hell. Lauren badmouthed me, would miss pick up times and make decisions without talking to me. Her dad offered money to relinquish custody, I told him off.’ 

-That sucks! Her behavior wasn’t acceptable, it sounds like something a child would do….
Oh wait, ! Laren’s brain wasn’t fully formed either!

‘Ariel is now 19 and just started college. The deal was me and her mom would split it. ‘

-Awesome! Sounds like the parents have put the past aside for the benefit of their innocent child!


‘I remarried Tori when Ariel was 6.’
-WHAT??? You married your ex’s old best friend? The one who outed the emotional affair??

‘Tori was a rock during the divorce but we didn’t date till 2 years later.’  
-OK! While you can say this is OK, cause on paper…yeah sure.  But, no…It’s great that you have found your new life partner, but you had to know that this would cause problems!  You went into this 2nd marriage with your eyes wide open as a fully formed adult!!

‘Lauren used this to warp Ariel against Tori and our son (13M).’  - Ooops! No one could have predicted this from previous bad behavior!  Yup, from a fully formed adult with the emotional behavior of a child!  Ouch, Lauren!


‘She excludes them. Whenever she spends the night she will just talk to me or go to her room if my family was around.’

-So you have a relationship with your daughter, who is a child?  And it’s hard because she doesn’t consider her step-mother and half-brother family?  What is she going to do, somehow be wiser and more mature than her emotionally immature parents????  HOW???  Who could possibly have taught her????

‘Our son walks to the basement if she comes over. It hurts me a lot. I’ve spent thousands on therapy before people bring that up. It still is being utilized. ‘

There’s so much wrong here! You are responsible for your feelings, no one makes you feel, you own your own feelings.  Don’t blame them on your first born child!  You can’t control or make Ariel feel differently than she does!

‘But at this point Ariel is being nasty for the sake of it. Her mom has convinced her I cheated with her friend and had a baby. Which is funny because as I’ve pointed out. The timelines don’t even match up. I’ve done everything at this point including family time, 1 on 1 and therapy. Ariel is plain rude to them and they are done trying.’

WHAT??? You are giving up on your relationship with your 19 year old child????  You can’t divorce children!!!!!  This is a pattern for you now.

‘Ariel graduated from HS in may and hosted a party. I was invited but my family wasn’t. I told Ariel I found that disrespectful. So I’d send a card but wouldn’t be going. She didn’t care and we haven’t spoken since.’

- This sounds like a you problem.  You are the one who perceives disrespect.  You want to control Ariel by somehow making her accept your current wife and second child.  You are the adult, but you are still behaving badly.  It’s just not as noticeably bad behavior because there’s lots of reasons you’ve come up with in order to make yourself feel justified.

She got her 18 years of child support from me. So until she planned on setting the record straight that I was done with both of them. And blocked her.’

- Oh, wait, here’s all these reasons for you to hate your ex wife and punish your first born child! I get it now!  You were holding on to all these things and never got over them, and now is the perfect chance to GET BACK AT YOUR EX WIFE by punishing Ariel!!! That makes perfect sense!!!

‘I called Ariel and told her the same. Gave the reasons I’m not paying and told her she needed to look into loans. But I would pay for college if she at least tried to form a bond with my family because she created this situation with her attitude.’
- WRONG! You, your ex wife, and your current wife are the adults with baggage here!  You created this situation!!!

‘So if she wants my help, she needs to attempt it. She started crying. But I didn’t fall for it. Told her what my expectations were and to let me know what her plan is so I can move the money around. My wife is on my side here. Saying we’ve been the bad guys for long enough.But I’m getting shit from others.’

- THANK GOD someone is standing up for Ariel, and giving you shit!  Your decision to not pay for Ariel’s tuition is vindictive, she is a child.  It seems like you want her to pay for your mistakes because having her made your life difficult.
YTA

Such a huge asshole!  If you do this, Ariel should cut you out of her life forever.  You are behaving spiteful and not like a proper parent or father and I feel really bad for Ariel because her Mother, father and step-mother care more about themselves then her.  She is your child.  Stop the cycle.  Do right by her.  Take responsibility for your feelings and actions so that she can grow up and heal from now on.  If you wound Ariel like this, she will always believe everything her Mother tells her about you, plus she’ll have her own proof.  Her brain isn’t fully formed yet, you need to be the adult and model better behavior now.",83,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/x0rdi7/aita_for_telling_my_daughter_i_wont_be_paying_for/
"AITA for not taking a ""special request"" from my wife while cooking the family breakfast?","Last weekend I (36m) decided that I was going to make my family (wife 35 and kids 12f, 11f, 9m) a big breakfast spread as part of the ""lame"" (according to our oldest daughter) family time that we decided to have that day. The plan was to have breakfast together, watch a movie, have lunch, and play some games as a family before we released the kids from the clutches of the, again, ""lame"" family time.

So anyway I got up early, heated up the waffle iron and the huge stovetop skillet, and went to work making waffles, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, and hashbrowns. As I was finishing and the kids had plated up my wife asked me to throw a couple of eggs overeasy on for her. She's the only one in our family who can stand runny yolks; neither I nor the kids will touch them, but she she really likes them.  I just told her ""Nah; I'm finishing up already. If you really want a couple of eggs your way and want to make them yourself go for it but I'm done."" She responded ""You're already cooking. I'm in the mood for a couple of overeasy eggs. Why can't you just throw them on for me?"" I refused and it turned into way more a quiet, bickering argument than it should have.

It's been on my mind since and on the one hand I feel bad my wife just asked me for a small favor that wouldn't have been a big deal at all to fulfill. But on the other hand I had made plenty of food already. My wife likes scrambled eggs too just fine and there was plenty of food for her to eat. Why did she need to go insisting on her special request? 

It was honestly a silly, petty fight but nonetheless I'm curious who people think was in the right.

Edit: The top question asked if my wife and I routinely bicker this way. No, we don't. That's why this bothered me so much. Neither of us usually dig our heels in so much over something so minor, which is why I felt weird enough about this to ask strangers about it.

Now, having said that, while there is some dissention the prevailing opinion is that I was wrong. I accept that. I let the lazy mood I was in that morning take over when I should have just made my wife happy. But some people are making way too much out of this. My wife and I love each other and love our children and everything is good. We have a good family. Stop wishing bad upon our marriage and family just because I got a little lazy one morning. I just wanted to know if I was in the wrong in this one situation and apparently I was. I  can accept that.

Finally people apparently took me saying that the cooking is 75/25 in favor of my wife to mean that I do almost nothing to contribute to the family. That whole 75/25 thing was a bit of an orphan statistic with no context. I have a full-time job while my wife works between 10-12 hours a week at home. Our division of labor is fair.

But I do accept that I'm the asshole. I shouldn't have been lazy and should have just given my wife what she wanted.",17455,xwff58,">I feel bad my wife just asked me for a small favor that wouldn't have been a big deal at all to fulfill.

AITA for telling my husband he should be ashamed of himself and taking the girls and going home after he made them wait outside of the restaurant?,"
I'm a mother of twins (19f). Their dad and I split up 6 years ago and I'm now (fixed it it was not but I meant now)married to my husband ""Kevin""

Problem is...Kevin thinks that my girls are not discipline simply because they don't follow everything he tells them because they don't see him as their father...We've already talked about that. Especially the part where he expects them to dress how he wants them to, and behave how he wants them too. He even called them ""weirdos"" but that's just how teenagers are and it's not a new thing.


Anyways. I told him he needed to loosen up a little and lessen his expectations of them but I get it's hard to do given he was brought up in a ""conservative"" household with hard-core Christian family.


Last week. He started a fight after seeing one of the girls' hairstyle and said that she was looking ""trashy"". Because of the we had to cancel our trip to the mall because he refused to drive us.


A couple of days ago. We wanted to go out for dinner. I was intending on getting off work at 6 but had some stuff to get done. My husband and I agreed that he'd take the girls and go to the restaurant and wait for me there. He called me before they got out of the house to complain about what the girls were wearing. The girls sent me pics and I thought nothing was wrong with their outfits and told him to drop it and just go. He said fine then muttered something about me enabling thrm then hung up.


While I was still at work I got a call from one of the girls telling me their stepdad had them stand and wait outside the restaurant because ""he didnt want to be seen with them dressing like that"". I was stunned I rushed to the restaurant and found them near the car. They explained he told them to wait in the car til he tell them to come in (basically wait for me) they started crying I had them get in my car then went inside the restaurant and found him on his phone. I went off on him and told him he should be ashamed of himself for treating my daughter's like if there was something to be ashamed of. He tried backpaddling saying it wasn't like that but I interrupted him then walked out after cancelling dinner.

We went home and he came back hours later trying to argue that I can't blame him for disapproving of what the girls ""recklessness"" and that he tried communicating but I shut him down and treated him as less of a parent when he's just wanting what's best for them.

He doesn't speak to me or the girls anymore.",17448,w0pvjz,"Info: Why are you still with a man that wants to treat your teen girls like dress up dolls that can only wear what he approves, calls them trashy and then punishes them for not marching to the beat of his drum?

AITA for not talking to my MIL after she insisted my daughter not sign at the dinner table?,"I (29F) have a daughter (6F) from a previous relationship, her father has no contact with her and my husband of 2 years (30M) is the closed to a father she has ever known.

My daughter was born deaf and communicates via BSL. I am fluent having learned alongside her and my husband while not fluent is getting there as he wants to be able to communicate with her fully and also help teach any children we have together to communicate with their older sister. 

We went to his parents for an Easter Dinner, his siblings and nieces/nephews were all there and we of course brought my daughter. All the kids were very happy to get plenty of chocolate and play together, the issue rose however during dinner as my daughter kept putting her fork and knife down to sign with me and my husband to talk, it was causing her to eat slower than everyone else and my MIL asked me to tell her to not sign at the dinner table as the food was going to get cold plus it was setting a bad example and distracting for the other kids.

I won't beat around the bush I got angry, I told my MIL that this is how my daughter communicates and i'm not going to make her not sign, i *did* encourage my daughter to continue eating before her dinner got cold but to not sign? no...that pisses me off and makes me think of people who have tried to make my daughter play the ""Quiet hands"" game....aka not sign. I told my MIL the only way she could ask that of my daughter is if she told everyone else not to talk at all.

We ended up leaving a little early and my husband while supportive of me has tried to tell me that his Mother didn't mean any real harm and she doesn't get why this would be a sensitive topic. I've refused to speak to my MIL since that dinner and won't until she apologises, my husband thinks i'm being a bit too harsh and I need to be the one to reach out with an olive branch on this matter but I can't help but feel if this had been her biological grandchild who was deaf she wouldn't have said something so insensitive or implied it was a distraction and bad example. 

I don't know, maybe i'm too defensive as it's my child and i'm protective, what do you all think?",17434,u7tfbu,"NTA.

AITA for telling my coworker that my personal out-of-work activities are as important as her kids'?,"Trying to keep this short -

I am a married 36 year old woman with no plans to have kids. I recently had an issue with a coworker where our boss emailed her/I to ask if one of us could cover an evening call (it's a 9-5 job but we occasionally have evening calls due to collaborators in different time zones). The coworker asked me to do it because her son had a soccer game, but I said that I can't do it because I had a volleyball game. She said that I should do it because the soccer game is for her kid and my volleyball game is just for me. I said that respectfully my outside-of-work commitments are not less important than hers because I don't have children, and that she should take the call because I had taken the last two. She scoffed at me, and I know that other people around the office have been gossiping about me since and saying that it was super messed up that I made her miss her kid's soccer game.

I think that it's incredibly important to support working mothers. I am always more than happy to accommodate the schedules of the mothers I work with when it doesn't cause a significant inconvenience to me - for example, some coworkers leave early to pick up their kids (our company is great about that), and I'm happy to work project schedules around that. I also would have taken that call if I hadn't had a conflict as long as it wasn't a pattern of me taking significantly more evening calls.

I talked to a friend about this (who is a mother), and she said that I should have just done it because people who don't have kids really should have more empathy for working parents and we don't understand how hard it is. I said respectfully that I do understand that working mothers have much more stressful lives than I do, which is why I decided not to be a mother. I also said that I can have respect and empathy for working mothers and also value my time/ choices equally. She similarly scoffed and said that I don't understand.

AITA here?

Follow-up: Thanks everyone for the support! I'd like to acknowledge that a lot of the support is coming from working mothers, which I appreciate.

AITA for kicking my sister's husband out of my house because of what he did?,"


I (f34) lost my husband 8 weeks ago, he had cancer and it got treated then it came back. It was and still is so devastating, I'm trying to stay collected and welcoming to all the supportive family members who come to offer help despite my constant change in mood due to grief.


My sister is the most supportive one, although her husband would act inappropriately sometimes, especially after he told me after the funeral that now I'm ""burden"" free and can ""live my life"" given I was my husband's sole carer. I try to let go of those comments thinking he didn't know better.


He, my sister, and my family came to visit last week. They cooked dinner for me and kept me company for a bit. After dinner, my brother in law asked for a minute with me inside the kitchen. He started telling about a coworker of his who's single then went on to list everything good about him. I was confused as to why he was telling me all that. he then reached out for his pant pocket and pulled a piece of paper with his co worker's phone number on it telling me to give him a call sometime. I was floored I couldn't really tell if he was joking or what but he looked serious and kept insisting I take the number. I lost it, I just started yelling at him that my husband just died and he was out of his mind to try to hook me up with a coworker of his. He tried to explaine that it wasn't like that and that he was just offering me something helpful but I didn't know what he meant. I called him disrespectful then yelled at him to get out of my house. My sister and the others ran into the kitchen not knowing what was going on, I told them then pressured him to leave my house but my sister asked that I calm down but I couldn't. He left then my sister left quietly. 

After I'd calmed down I sat with my family and they said I was right in that what he did was not okay, but I needed to keep in mind that he and my sister helped so much by cooking for me, comforting me and doing so much for me in these difficult times so, I shouldn't have reacted like that and could've been a little more considerate and graceful. They said kicking him out was too much and I should call him later and talk things out so I won't ruin my relationship with him and possibly my sister.

AITA for being upset my wife didn't stay in the hospital with me?,"So I (35M) was in a motorcycle accident earlier this week. My wife (35F) has 3 kids from a previous marriage (17F, 10M, 5M) and we have a 1 year old together.

AITA for refusing to babysit my niece and leaving her with a stranger instead?,"I (F24) am an aunt to my 1 year old niece Ava. My sister and BIL live close to me so I babysit for them sometimes. They don't pay me but I'm happy to do it anyway. 

On Friday was their anniversary and they asked me 3 weeks in advance if I could babysit, I provisionally agreed because I had nothing else planned. My plans changed however when some of my old college friends told me they were stopping by my town on Friday. I haven't seen them in nearly 3 years and really wanted to see them. 

I gave my sister 5 days notice that I could no longer babysit on Friday, and that she should make other arrangements. She didn't respond to the text, but she read it, so I assumed it was OK.

On Friday however sister stopped by my house with Ava. I was confused and asked why she was here, she told me she was leaving Ava with me as originally planned. I said again I was busy, she replied that family is more important than my ""silly college friends"" and I should step up to my responsibility as an aunt. Before I could protest, she bolted back to the car where BIL was and they drove off, leaving Ava with me. I tried to call her after she left but she had her phone off and none of my calls went through.

I didn't know what to do. I couldn't leave Ava alone but I also didn't want to cancel my plans.There's no other family members who live near me- however I do have a friend, Jade, who lives near. She is good with kids and does baby sitting as a side hustle. I called her and explained the situation, even offering to pay her to look after Ava, but she was understanding and said she'd do it for free. I thanked her profusely and dropped Ava off.

I texted my sister to say I'd left Ava with Jade and to collect her from her house. It's relevant to the story that neither sister nor Ava know Jade personally. My sister didn't respond immediately but after about 2 hours she started spamming my phone. I turned my phone off, as I was already out by that point anyway.

They picked up Ava later that evening and she was perfectly happy, however my sister and BIL are furious at me for ""dumping Ava with a stranger"" (even though they know Jade is a trusted friend of mine.) They accused me of endangering my own niece. Many other family members have sided with them and I've been getting angry texts all weekend.

AITA for telling my parents I am not going to help them out ever again and they are now on their own?,"I am the oldest in my family. I had two siblings. My sister died when she was 6 months old in a SIDS death. I was 5 at the time. When I was 6 they had my brother. From a young age my brother showed concerning behavior and over the years it only got worse. He is very destructive and angry and has been in and out of our local children's hospital for psych evals and behavioral assessments since he was 4 years old. The police have been called to our house many times before to help get him under control. He has never been formally diagnosed but he was medicated a few times to sedate him and try to curb his outbursts. 

My life was on hold because of all of this. I was not allowed to have friends over, I was not allowed to attend birthday parties until I was old enough to walk there myself. Money was tight and it meant sacrificing a lot. I was 9 when I last celebrated my birthday with my family and once I hit 9 there was nothing again until I was 13 and considered old enough to do something with my friends without adult supervision. And even then I had to ask for no gifts because anything I had was broken by my brother. It was a nightmare.

My parents would often leave me in charge so they could get a break and then my life was hell. Once I was around 12 I was considered old enough to watch him while mom got groceries, even though I was not old enough to go hang with my friends. By 14 it was hours at night. A few times even overnight. I was not prepared and our house was destroyed every time. And my parents would express disappointment in my handling of things.

The best period of time was when I was 16 and he was placed in residential treatment for a whole month. It was by far the best month of my life in years at that point. It was hard when he returned, no better than he was when he left. It felt like my life had ended.

I moved out as soon as I could and I have distanced myself from my family. My parents have tried to keep in touch but I am bitter toward them for my childhood. And they are aware. They have made excuses for why they made certain decisions. Now they need my help. My brother has gotten worse, they haven't had any kind of a break in 7 months, they want me to babysit for a few hours or a night so they can get a break. I told them no. They told me they need my help. That's when I told them I would never help them again and they are on their own.

They told me I was being unfair. They asked me how I could do this to them.

He really wanted to talk to them because his friends went on a boys trip without him because I asked to stay back so he could be here when I went into labor, they were calling to tell him about how their trip was going

AITA for saying “I told you so” at my SIL and Brothers wedding?,"I (27F) have known for SIL for three years. She’s the type of person that always needs to be right and needs to be in charge of everything. She’s very demanding as well. 

My SIL’s family members are very disrespectful and rude. They don’t clean up after themselves, expect everyone to act like maids or servants around them and they think very highly of themselves. They can never be wrong and think they can do no wrong. 

Because of this my SIL’s family don’t really punish their kids. Like they have no consequences. They aren’t even like the gentle parenting type either. 

My SIL’s sister has a son and he’s extremely chaotic. He throws tantrums if he doesn’t get something and he has to be center of attention 24/7. When they’re are birthdays he needs a gift or opens the gifts and needs to blow out candles. It’s frustrating which is why I’m not usually around at family gatherings and other stuff. 

I was my SIL since her friend cancelled on her and I was helping make invitations. I saw one of the names were SIL’s nephew. I asked if she wanted him to go and she said yeah. She then asked why. So I told her why. 

I talked about his tantrums and how he’ll probably throw a fit during the reception and other stuff. She got mad and said that she didn’t know what i was talking about. She told my family and her sister which caused her sister to write me a message saying how I was wrong and other stuff like that. 

Well day of the wedding comes. Everyone comes in happy except Nephew. He’s crying and is about to throw a fit. When my SIL came out he literally started screaming. The poor Pastor had to stop and wait for the parents to leave. 

During the after party he was back and again crying. When they were cutting the cake he screamed extremely loud he pushed my SIL who was holding a glass of wine and spilled on her. She started crying. 
She turned around to leave and I looked at her and said “I told you so” she started crying even more now.  

When i got home my mom called me extremely immature and wants me to apologize. So, aita?

Edit: When i went on facebook I saw a long post from SIL’s sister. Basically saying that SIL knew how her nephew (9) was, and how if she didn’t want him to throw a tantrum she should’ve never invited them. She also called SIL selfish saying she should’ve offered nephew to cut the cake with her. SIL’s family also agreed and called SIL selfish. So i went over to SIL’s house with a bottle wine. She told me i was right and how she should’ve never invited them. I still apologized though because I did kick while she was down. I’ve offered to pay to get her wedding dress cleaned but she said that it was fine.",17255,wd28yt,I'mma pass on judgment here but say I'd have totally done the same thing and I find this hilarious,6835,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wd28yt/aita_for_saying_i_told_you_so_at_my_sil_and/
AITA for telling my husband to quit waking me up?,"AITA for calling my husband out on this? Without fail every time my (29f) husband (37m) wakes up in the middle of the night he wakes me fully up to ask me what time it is.  

Both of us sleep with our cellphones charging next to our beds.  So, it’s just as easy for him to reach out and check the time on his own phone as it is for him to wake me up and ask me.

My husband says I’m being AH because I’m making a big deal out of nothing.  I say, waking me up for something meaningless that he can do for himself with less effort than he expends asking me shows a complete disregard for me and is really selfish of him.  

Now, I know you’re going to say that I’m making a huge deal out of nothing.  But, it’s not like this is a sometimes thing.  He does it often, several times a week.  And when he does it it always takes me forever to fall back to sleep. 

We both work full time jobs and have an infant.  I do 100% of the nighttime baby duties because my husband commutes farther than I do. So, he says it just makes sense for me to let him sleep since he has to be out the door before I do in the mornings. 

I need to be clear, I’m not complaining if he wakes me up due to the baby needing me. (I wake up to his cries, I don’t think my husband even hears it.). 

My complaint is strictly that HE wakes me up to ask me what time it is.   I feel like he’s being really selfish. Sometimes, I just want to sleep too.

AITA for insisting my Black family be included in my wedding photos?,"When I (31M) was 16, my sister outed my to my very wealthy, conservative parents. After a long back-and-forth between them and me, they decided to kick me out two days after my 17th birthday.

I was close with one of my best friend’s parents, and they generously took me in at their house in the Bronx. In the 6 months I lived there, my friend’s mom became my mom, and her dad became my dad. When my friend’s family would explain who I was to other people, they would always say they’re my Black family (or Black mom, Black dad, etc.) and say my white family was taking some time to figure things out.

Eventually, my bio parents accepted me, something my Black family was very supportive of, and I moved back to my childhood home, but I would always call my Black mom and dad and would visit from time to time. They never stopped being my family.

Next week, I’m getting married to a wonderful man, and my biological parents are paying for a large portion of the wedding.

AITA for yelling to be let out of the car when my boyfriend's dad turned on the one feature I asked him not to?,"I spent last night with my boyfriend's family, we'd gone out to dinner and his dad was gonna drive.

So my boyfriend, me, his parents, and his brother all squeezed into his dad's car and we went to the restaurant. I had a few drinks and his dad had two, since he was gonna drive.

But on the way back his dad started asking me ""you work on self driving cars, yeah?"" (I do, I'm a systems engineer and have job hopped between a handful of autonomy companies.) 

He started asking me how I liked his Tesla and I joked ""just fine as long as you're the one driving it!"" And he asked me what I thought about FSD which he'd just bought. He asked if he should turn it on. I said ""not with me in the car"" and he then laughed and asked how I was still so scared when I work with this stuff everyday. 

I was like ""Uhh it's because I..."" But stopped when he pulled over and literally started turning it on. I was like ""I'm not kidding, let me out of the car if you're gonna do this"" and my boyfriend's dad and brother started laughing at me, and my boyfriend still wasn't saying anything. 

His dad was like ""It'll be fine"" and I reached over my boyfriend's little brother and tried the door handle which was locked. I was getting mad, and probably moreso because I was tipsy, and I yelled at him ""Let me the fuck out"" 

My boyfriend started trying to tell me to calm down because I was drunk and I told him that it didn't fucking matter, I'd be outta here sober or drunk. He told me to stop cussing in front of his little brother, and I told him to tell his dad to cut his shit out and I wouldn't have anything to cuss over. 

His dad was like ""fine, I didn't realize it'd be suuuch a big deal"" and drove home normally, but things have been tense as hell. 

We got back to his house and he was mad at me for ""overreacting"" the first time I met his family all together. I got angry and was like ""I'm not the one who decided to do the ONE THING that I said I'm not comfortable with in the car, just after I asked him not to, to laugh at me""  

He said that his dad used the car a lot, and it was fine, and I asked him (since we're both rock climbers) would he ever get on a route with his carbainer that doesn't lock? What if someone says they do it all the time and it's fine? He was like ""absolutely not, but that's different"" and I was like ""it's literally not, just like we don't know any climbers who'd do that shit, nobody in my field that I know would stay in that car.

He got mad and told me to go to sleep, I was drunk. But honestly today I woke up sober and I stand by what I did, like I wasn't comfortable with what was happening and my boyfriend's family all laughed and started trying to do the one fucking thing I said no to? Like whatever that thing is, it's fucked up.

AITA for blowing up at my wife for going to her gender-reveal appointment without me?,"

My wife and I are expecting our first baby together, We made an appointment to find out the gender of the baby. To me, this is very important (I had hopes for a boy) unfortunately, the day of the dr appointment I had to attend my friend's birthday that I remembered last minute. I asked my wife if we could cancel the appointment and go another day but she looked shocked that I even considered canceling the appointment and going to my friend's birthday, I said I had no choice. She said canceling the dr appointment was off the table because these appointments are restricted to specific time and date and we can't miss it so she'll go alone. I told her no because that'd be selfish of her and besides this will ruin the news of finding out if the baby is a boy or a girl. She cut the discussion and told me to go to the birthday party. I did then later found out she didn't cancel the dr appointment and went with her mom. I came home seething and blew up at her. I started arguing with her about going behind my back and doing this without me. She said it wasn't her fault I prioritized a party over my child. I told her I didn't prioritize anything; she literally could've canceled and we would've went another day but clearly, she was trying to steer the fight to a direction where I look like the neglectful and irresponsible one. We fought some then she said I'm probably angry with her because it's a girl but I responded that she was wrong. She went outside the room claiming I was ""stressing her out"". now acts like I owe her an apology on top of everything else but I feel upset and like I was decieved by her.


AITA?


INFO: first off ??? Jesus, I swear I came here thinking I was somewhat justified in my frustration but I was wrong it seems. Although I just wanna point out that I did not just go to the party without telling my wife and having a discussion with her first. Also the friend lives 2 hours away so I had to leave at 2 and the appoitment was at 4. I did not know she went and I would've appreciated it if she at least was upfront with me about what she did. She could've said she was going anyway but instead told me to go to the party and had me thinking she was going to cancel and reschedule.


EDIT For those who are speculating on the type of parent I am/will be really don't know enough to make those assumptions so I'd appreciate it if you'd just focus on the conflict I just presented.",17246,sqaubq,"YTA.

You prioritised a friends birthday over attending the appointment. A friend who is *so* important you completely forgot their birthday until the day of the party.
It would have been very easy to apologise to your friend and explain you’re not coming because you’re finding out the gender of your baby. Any decent friend would be excited for you. 

Your wife is correct, these appointments can’t be changed short notice, they need to be booked weeks in advance and the scans need to be done within a certain time frame. The fact you don’t know any of this and your wife is pregnant makes you an asshole. 

Being a parent means making sacrifices. You need to choose what is really important to you, hot tip, it should always be your wife and kid/s. If you still have a wife, because unless you start eating some humble pie and apologising for your major fuck up, she might realise she doesn’t want to be with someone who isn’t there when she needs them and blames her for their shitty choices.",7815,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sqaubq/aita_for_blowing_up_at_my_wife_for_going_to_her/
AITA for refusing to take my hijab off for a wedding?,"Can’t believe I’m posting about it, but I made a whole new account so people in my life don’t tie this to my main one. 

I (23F) am visibly Muslim as I wear a hijab (no I do not care about your opinions I’m regards to my religion, keep those thoughts to yourself). I also live in the south of the USA. Thankfully, the specific city I live in is a large metropolitan one, so it’s incredibly diverse and I rarely run into any issues. However my friend, let’s call her Sally (24F), is marrying a man who’s family is conservative American. 

Now I couldn’t care less about someone’s political views unless they start trying to talk to me about it or shove it down my throat, then in my opinion they invited me to the debate so they should prepare to to hear my opinions since they gave theirs unsolicited. Now the only time I don’t do this is when it could negatively affect someone else, such as a week ago when I went to Sally’s engagement party. Her in laws were loudly talking about politics, politics I didn’t quite agree with, but they weren’t talking to me and even if they were I wasn’t going to cause drama and a fight at my friends engagement party. 

However during the party, I spent most of my time hanging out with a few friends, while Sally’s in laws kept looking at me oddly from the side of their eye. I try not to take it to heart, so I ignore it. 

The next day, Sally calls me to thank me for coming. At some point in the call she seems nervous to say something, so I ask her to just spit it out. That’s when she admitted that I made her in laws uncomfortable, and as though they couldn’t freely talk with someone like me around. 

I say sorry, but her in laws seem like blatant racists, but it’s not like I’m the one marrying them so if she likes them I hope she has a great wedding and I just won’t come. Now Sally was expecting my help during the wedding, as I freelance as a make up artist, so she asks if I can just take off my hijab for the wedding and do her makeup while not “scaring” her in laws. 

Here’s where I may be the asshole, I tell her “no way in fucking hell would I ever change myself or compromise my religion for a bunch strangers, and I won’t step foot near them as I’d hate to “scare” them”. 

Now she’s mad I offended her and her future family, and while my other friends say her suggestion was wildly inappropriate, I did promise to do her makeup for free, and with the wedding only a month away, I left her in a tough position. AITA?

Edit: thanks everyone for all of your amazing comments and insights I loved reading every one of them! For those who had kind things to say, even if they disagreed with my wording or thought I was slightly rude for it, thank you for commenting! To those who pointed out that for “someone who said I don’t care about opinions I certainly am getting a lot of comments bla bla bla”, I meant that I don’t care about bigoted opinions that criticize my religion for no absolute reason. Now if someone commented that I am TA, and gave me a reason that wasn’t “all Muslims suck” or “you’re oppressed and subjugated by men”, I genuinely read and appreciated the feedback. And to those who think this post is fake because “racism doesn’t exist anymore”…. Bro I wish.

AITA for making a big deal about my birthday and saying I do not want it to be made all about my sister?,"I'm (15m) turning 16 in less than a month and my parents had talked about throwing me a party with my friends and family there to celebrate and I let myself get excited about it, which I am starting to feel was dumb on my part. See I have a little sister Ava and she's 7. She was a baby my parents tried to have for a few years after I was born, but struggled and then she was born premature and almost died. It meant my parents had to put a lot of time into her when she was little. It meant a lot of the time our world revolved around her. Back then I would hear people say once she was a little older that things would return to normal. They never really did. My parents prioritize Ava over me. I know she's a lot younger and it makes sense at times. 

Some examples of it (but not all): Two years ago for Christmas I really wanted a PS5. I made a deal with my parents that if I saved up x amount of money, they would pay the rest for it as a gift. A drop came close by us and I had the money. Mom told me that Ava needed a haircut and they wanted to pamper her a little because she'd been to the developmental pediatrician which she hates. So the money that would have gotten the PS5 went on her and I never got the PS5. Instead I got some clothes and food stuff for Christmas. And the food was ""share"" items we get. Not even my favorites.

My high school did an award ceremony in May to celebrate students who help make the school better. I was given one for helping others in school and acting as a mentor of sorts. Ava's school play was on the same day and both of my parents chose to go to the school play instead of the award ceremony. They didn't even remember to ask me about it when I got home.

My birthday's have always been more aimed at something Ava will enjoy too. We do Chuck E Cheese where I can bring a friend, or they hire a bounce house for family to come over, but always a smaller one which means I don't get to enjoy it because younger kids and small bounce house. The spotlight always goes to her at least once. She's blown out my birthday candles since she was 2.

This year I really thought it would be different. All the plans were sounding really fun too. Then my parents found out Ava was being bullied in school and was having a rough time. They told me she wasn't looking forward to anything, including my party, and that they thought it would be nice to do something she could enjoy, and give her some of the spotlight on the day, where we assure her she's loved and wanted. I told them it was my birthday and I thought they wanted me to enjoy it. They told me they do, but Ava needs this and that as her big brother I should be thinking about how to make her feel special. I told them I deserve to feel that way too. Then I told them if they were going to do this to me again, I was done. I told them not everything needs to be about Ava. That she might be their whole world. She might be their whole focus in life. But she is not mine.

My parents got so mad at me.

"AITA for telling my fiance's family that he's unemployed after they kept implying that I was a ""Gold Digger?""","So, My fiance (m33) comes from a well off family, I (f29) come from a working class family. My fiance's family are nice but they can't help throwing comments at me about how I ""might be"" a ""Gold Digger"". For example, if he buys me something they'll go ""oh Jason bought you that? You know what this looks like right?"" And/or ""Wait, Jason paid for this? Only gold diggers make their partners pay for stuff all the time, *just sayin'*.... It's so demeaning and my fiance does nothing to stop it. Especially now that he's in a bad place in life after he lost his job. And since he's keeping it secret then, I'm the one paying for everything. This has been going on for 4 months.



Last week, His parents invited us for dinner and he insisted that we go so we went. At dinner table his mom grabbed my hand (literally while I was eating!!) And looked at my bracelet and went ""Oh, this bracelet looks really nice, did Jason pay for it?"" I nodded and reminded her that he bought it for me as a birthday gift last year. She was like ""hmmmm, wonder how much it costs....."" she then leaned back and said ""You know I remember when my brother was dating this gold digger woman...she'd recieve expensive stuff like this (pointing at the bracelet) bracelet here for her birthdays...."" I was stunned, I cut her off and asked if she meant to say that I was a Gold Digger. She threw her hands up and went ""I mean...if the shoe fits...."" while laughing awkwardly. Silence took over. I looked at my fiance and he shook his head at me like ""what?!?!?!"" I snapped!! . I told her it was bold of her to imply I was a Gold Digger when I'm literally providing for her unemployed son, have been for 4 months now. They all looked shocked. She glanced at me in shock and his dad asked if it was true and my fiance just froze but looked so angry. An argument ensued and dinner was cut short and we had to leave after they started berating him.


He had a rage fit in the car just yelling and lashing at me. In my defense, I said that he sat by and let his mom continuelly imply that I was a Gold Digger but he said that they never outright called me a Gold Digger so it was all in my head. He said I still had no right to take advantage of his ""unfortunate circumstance"" to get back at his mom and expose him to the family.

AITA for not baking an extra cupcake for my colleague?,"I (24/F) love baking, and I LOVE sharing my baked goods too. I generally get along with everyone else in the office except for this one guy (36/M) , which I will call Leo (not real name) whom I wasn't on very good terms with because of the events that happened years ago when I first joined the company years ago as a fresh graduate. 

Leo complained that I am ""lazy"", hates ""cleaning up after my mistakes"" and I made him ""vomit blood"". I did ask him for mentoring help to generate the reports in the way he expects but he didn't want to. Instead he asked me to look at his report and ""follow his style"". Fortunately I was redeployed to another role by in the same department with a better mentor. We don't talk to each other since.

My birthday fell on a Sunday. I decided to bake cupcakes for everyone in the office as form of celebration, to be given on Friday of that week. 

I considered baking one for him but decided against it because of how tried to share food but was rejected. I believed that even if I made him the cupcake, he would turn it down in way way which will make me ""loss face"" in front of everyone in the office. 

For practical reasons too, I decided to make 24 cupcakes (only have a 12 hole cupcake tray) there would be only 2 rounds of baking. There was 25 people in the office excluding me.

So on Friday, I came into office with a box of cupcakes, which took me the whole night to bake and I also woke up early to put the frosting in. 

Right after lunch, I went from table to table offering my colleagues a cupcake each and everyone was appreciative of it. When I reached Leo's table, I tried offering it to him. As expected, he said no, but in manner I find to be pretty respectful.

After distributing the cupcakes, one of my colleague came up to me and asked for the extra cupcake that Leo rejected. I told my colleague I actually baked just enough for the office, excluding Leo, so there was no extra cupcake. My colleague looks shocked so I told her that baking the cupcakes didn't come cheap and since Leo was going to reject it anyway, I didn't bake more. I also told her about the limits of my oven and I just simply didn't have enough time to do three rounds of baking only to be turned down at the end.

When I came back on Monday, word has apparently spread to everyone in my department how Leo didn't ""get"" a cupcake and I left him out him intentionally. Leo didn't say anything to me about the cupcake thing but I was told by a colleague that he was really upset and he ""really loved cupcakes"", and would have ""came around if I had just left some in the fridge and leave him alone to get it"". 

So Reddit, am I the asshole for baking 24 cupcakes instead of more? I mean I could do just one more round in the oven with ONE or two more cupcakes but it would be a waste of electricity and my time.",17193,wo7oyo,I'm curious- you offered Leo a cupcake expecting him to reject it.

I (f#31) became the only income earner after my husband Jeff (m#35) lost his job about 9 months ago. He doesn't have a car anymore because he sold it to be able to pay off debts.


He started asking to drive my car with the excuse of wanting to look for a job. there are 2 problems with this...first is that I'm a nurse I work odd hours and need my car most of the time and he literally takes it all day and comes back late in the evening. second is that every time he comes home the car either has a busted taillight, damaged front, flat tires etc, etc, etc.

So far I had to spend nearly $300 bucks to get it back in good shape. I told him I no longer want him to take my car but he said I had to let him drive it so he could continue to look for a job. I told him he could search online but he said something about scammers trying to pose as potential employers just to get his personal info (never had this happen to us).


Days ago, he went out with my car and I ended up being late for my shift. I called a friend to cover for me and tried to call him but he returned home at midnight. I had a fight with him after he said he was with friends and time passed by. I took the key of the car and put it under my pillow then went to sleep.

The next morning I saw him standing near the bed wanting me to give him the car key so he could go ""lOoK fOr A jOb"" I said no but he got mad and started demanding I hand it over. I told him FINE and pointed towards the sock drawer where we had lots of junk and told him it was there. I lied and he got some old key that looked like it. Once he walked out I locked the door and got in bed. Few minutes later he came back and started pounding on the door asking if I gave him a fake key. I said I did just to get him off of my back..he started yelling at me saying I was being childish and demanded I open the door and give him the real key. I remained in bed while he kept yelling outside saying I'm giving him lot of shit for not working YET not willing to let him *effectively* look for a job. He also said that I'd been testing his patience several times and he's had about enough. he yelled some more then left.

I was so infuriated and just maddened about the whole situation. I had a shift to cover and I knew that if he took the car then he won't bring it back in time. I got to my work and we haven't talked. He was in full sulking mode after I returned and kept ranting about how unsupportive and childish I was to pull this stunt.",17161,uelu0s,"NTA. He is lying.

No visitation after he got remarried at all.  When we called to asked when he was going to visit us, he would just say that he was busy.

Before the divorce, I was literally daddy's little girl. His beloved golden child. No joke. I thought my father was the best and I wanted to marry a man like him when I grew up. So, the fact that he just dropped my brother and me off  has caused a deep seated wound deep in my heart which I will never ever forgive him for causing.

He never paid child support so my mother had to support my brother and I as a single parent. She decided not to take him to court as she never wanted anything to do with him again. (Parents had 50/50 custody).

However,18 years is a long time and thanks to my mother's  love and care for us, I have already forgotten about him and moved on with my life, same goes for my brother. We have both grown up to live comfortably in our lives, take care of our mother and love her to no end.

The story is that this morning, his SS(33) contacted me via FB and said he wanted to talk to me regarding 'OUR' father and I was confused at first and then remembered that yes, I had someone like that in my life.

He told me that our father has a medical condition and treatment costs a lot (sent together with screenshots of his medical reports) and it would be nice if we could pay his bills and also that my 'father' wanted to speak to my brother and I. I told him that, that man lost the the rights to be my father when he decided to not have any contact with us and also that 'HIS' father's medical bills are non of my concern so as his children, you shouldn't go around harrassing random people for money. Also all those years of unpaid child support could be used to cover his medical expenses. After which he called me a vengeful and heartless bitch, to which I just replied with a smiling emoji and blocked his ass.

I talked to my mom about this and she said while I have the right to be angry with him, he is still my father and is unwell, so I could help them out a bit. I told her ""No way in hell am I going to pay for his bills. He has his children to pay for it, so let them settle it. He made his bed, now let him sleep on it""

Was I the asshole here?

EDIT: Many people were confused about was SS was. In this case it is step-son. Apologies for the confusion.

AITA for telling my housemate his girlfriend cant stay anymore?,"I share an apartment with a friend I've known for years (both M24). We have had this place for over a year and havent had any real issues, we get along well and do heaps together. He works full time, I am a university student and we split all bills, food and rent down the middle (we hate the idea of 'share houses' and just want it to feel like a home). 

A few months ago, he started seeing a girl (T) who spends every day and night at our place (T is also a university student and hates her studio apartment.). Until recently, I have had no issue with T being here and have never asked her to pay for anything. She eats all meals at our place and takes food to uni if she needs. They way I see it, housemate and I just buy a bit more food and it really doesn't matter. 

The other week, I got home from uni, went to the kitchen to make a coffee (I had an assignment I needed to work on so wanted a pick me up) and when I opened the fridge I noticed some redbulls. I just assumed my housemate had gotten them for us so I grabbed one and drank it. 

The next morning at breakfast, T opened the fridge and then got super angry that one of HER redbulls was missing. I said it was me and that I thought my housemate had gotten them. She started telling me how she bought them for herself and I should have asked and that I needed to apologise for taking it. 

I was going to tell T that its my fridge and I shouldn't have to ask if I can have stuff in it, but didn't want to start a conflict so just apologised.
She demanded I by her a replacement.... 

Since then she has started labelling any drinks or food she brings for herself and makes a point of saying its hers. 

After all this, I have said to my housemate that I don't want her staying at our place unless she is going to start paying rent, paying for bills and pitching in to pay for food. I don't want to pay for her anymore just so that she can abuse me for taking a drink from my own fridge. 

AITA?

Update:
Just to address some of the common things iv been reading (also thanks all, its nice to see only a few said ITA 🤣).

I avoided saying anything at the time because my housemate and I are close to brothers and I don't want a fight like this to make him have to pick (honestly I know he would dump her ass and stick with me). Housemate is a great guy and I in no way think he has tried to take advantage, when I have had gfs stay or we have had mates over, we have just kept to 50/50 as always (sometimes people buy us food or pitch in as thanks, but we never expect it). He and I act more as family in a house rather than housemates, which is why its never been an issue.

T is very manipulative. As a side story, housemate and I always do a movie night once a week. Its our tradition and we loved it. T has said she wants to join us and then every time, around 30mins in, she will wisper something to him or act a certain way and draw him away to the bedroom. Honestly its peeved me a tad as she is clearly just trying to assert some dominance there, but I also joke with the housemate about is and how little he is able to think with his bigger head when the little one is active.

I have laughed at the (few) comments calling me a pushover, and I can see how it looks like that here. I normally am the first to stand up and react to something and hate people being rude. In this situation it hasn't been an issue until and and my desire to not cause an issue was less about her, more about not wanting conflict with the housemate.

Since I talked to him about her needed to pay or leave, she has spent more time at her own place but now just comes round and has the ability to kill the mood in any room.

I want them to separate, I think he cant see this lasting either....but she is hot and he thinks with the wrong head.....a lot....",17159,w18e42,"NTA, she’s being extremely rude and self centered. She takes your food/drinks constantly, the very least she can do is understand that if she puts something in the fridge there’s a chance you could have some.

AITA for not correcting my kids who told my ex's wife she's not their mother?,"I have two sons ages 10 and 12 with my ex. We broke up over a number of issues. One of which was Emily, a woman he had worked with for years. The two of them grew very close and she was always telling me how my ex deserved better than me, that I was trying to steal his family away from him. A few times she even pretended to be his wife during work functions and my ex would laugh them off. As well as that he was really bad with money and other stuff.

After we separated he made things official with Emily which came as no surprise to me. 

Emily was even more openly hostile when she realized my ex's family still liked me and would still include me. Not to mention when she realized my boys weren't super happy she was their dad's new girlfriend. Emily actually called ex's mom a c\*nt for saying I was the best mom when they were all having a family dinner.

My ex got a firm warning from the judge about using Emily to do exchanges of our boys, and to deal with custody issues. This was after her confronting me a number of times during exchanges in front of my children and of her showing not just hostility, but saying things that could be taken as alienation of a parent. He continued to allow this and ex was fined for breaching the judges orders. He was told if it happened again custody would be modified.

Recently there has been an increase in the anger toward me. Emily is unable to have children and she wanted the boys to consider her a mom. They asked me for help and I said nope. That Emily was not the mother of my children and I wasn't going to encourage them to consider her one after the years of verbal abuse from her. 

The boys had an award night back at the start of June at school and while there, Emily told the boys to get in photos with her for the school newsletter. They said no. She told them she wasn't asking. They said she wasn't their mom so she couldn't say that. My ex scolded the boys but I said nothing. Ex and Emily said I should have backed them up and not allowed disrespect. I told them I did not find what they said disrespectful. They have claimed I am a shitty parent and I should not have let my kids get away with that. And I am teaching them to disrespect women, etc.

So now I am here to find out AITA?",17144,w8hsbq,"NTA - They stated facts. Also hilarious that they are compliant about not showing disrespect.

AITA for ordering something my step-sister didn't want to eat?,"My (25M) dad remarried 4 years ago. He has custody of my sister (full-sibling, 16F) fri to sun and he also has two step-children (A 16F and B 12F), I visit  my dad on the weekends to see my sister, my dad and I don't have the best relationship, but I love my sister with all my heart so I'm doing my best to still be around. 

My step-sister is heavily obsessed with korean and japanese culture, full k-pop, anime and things like that, there's nothing wrong with it and I'm not bashing her, both my sister and I like it too, the problem is that this obsession has caused her to ONLY eat asian food, and since she's mommy's girl and my dad has prioritized his new family over my sister, that's the only thing they eat (they're NOT asian). My sister has told me that she's done, she missed having hamburgers, pizzas, pasta, etc but that she can't eat them at dad's and with mom she does it very rarely because my mom cooks and she doesn't do this things every week (mom's mexican so she cooks mexican stuff). 

My dad order take out almost every weekend (and yeah, they mostly order sushi and stuff like that), this weekend was my turn to pay, my step-sister and step-mom were talking about some korean restaurant and things like that, but I looked at my sister and asked her what'd she wanted to eat, she said she had been craving a hamburger for weeks and I said ''done, I'll order it then'', my step-sister said ''Noo, I don't like to eat that'' so I just shrugged and said I could order her something else, but my dad said we all should eat the same thing since we're family, so I just said ''okay, burgers then'' we went back and forth and I ended up ordering burgers for me, my sister and B (12F), while my dad, my step-mom and A had sushi. My dad called me an AH for making A feel left out and I asked what'd he thought about his own kid, he kicked me out.",17141,x066qk,"NTA. It is one thing to want to eat the foods you like; it's another to dictate what foods other people eat. You are right, and your father is wrong.

AITA for kicking my brother and his family out after his son stole my engagement ring?,"The reason I (26M) know is because I literally caught him in my room going through my things. And it’s on freakin camera. My nephew is 9 and has a habit of stealing things. They’ve gotten in trouble a few times at stores because he’d leave with something in his pockets.

But ofc because he’s a kid they usually just say he forgot he had it. Even at school my brother has told me they have had to come talk to the principal aim a couple occasions. Doesn’t seem like they’ve done anything to stop it.

They had to come stay here with me because my brother lost his job and they weren’t gonna make it with all their bills including rent. He’s doing Uber rn while he searches for a job and they can move out. I didn’t want to because of my nephew specifically but family is family I guess. A month ago I finally bought an engagement ring for my girlfriend that I was planning on proposing to soon but now I don’t know.

It’s a $4k ring that I spent over a year saving up for. It’s been hidden in my room under one of my drawers. One time when I found him snooping in my room I told my brother to control his damm kid, then got one of those cheap spy cams in my room just incase. Then last week I noticed it was out of its box, after checking the cam it showed he was in there again when I wasn’t home. My brother and his wife have yelled at him.

He says he left it by the tv in the guest room but it’s not there. They looked through all their stuff and his too. I know for a fact he’s lying about not having it because that’s the same thing he said about one of my watches he took then ended up finding it. By the second day my brother tells me they can’t find it at all. And I told him either they find the ring or he repays me the $4k I spent on it, if not they can’t stay here anymore.

My brother got really upset, he told me I know how their situation is right now, and yeah it’s a tough spot but I couldn’t ignore the fact that his kid he can’t parent took something extremely important to me that costed a lot of time and money. They were given a week to leave my house if they don’t find the ring. They’re having to stay at a cheap motel but my brother won’t stop begging to come back because what they’re paying right now each night is coming directly out of their savings. He won’t stop calling me heartless about letting something like this come between helping them out through a difficult time and my nephew keeps saying he’s sorry. 

It’s just hard right now to want them around. Don’t even know what to do about the ring and every time I think about it it just makes me so mad that it’s hard to care about their situation. Does that make me an asshole?",17111,tzyzd1,"If you have a recording, go to the cops. Your brother is clearly not willing to teach his brat that stealing $4k is a serious crime; maybe the cops would do a better job.

Do check the local pawnshops- you may well find it there. If you do, they record transactions exactly for reasons like this, so you and the cops can see who pawned it.

AITA for pretending not to know my fiancé after she had a meltdown during boarding the plane and was eventually thrown off?,"I imagine I'm gonna get raked over the coals for this one. 

So, my fiancé (maybe not for much longer) and I were on our way back from a vacation recently. It was a great time and everything went off without an issue. That is until we started boarding the plane. Now, I know better, I only bring a small backpack with essentials incase I don't get my checked bags. I can survive out of this backpack and it will always pass baggage check for size and weight (done a lot of traveling so why fight the system). My fiancé didn't wanna listen to my advice and chose to bring basically a regular full-size bag that barely fits the standards of carry on, but generally speaking the airline worker doesn't wanna deal with the trouble and allows it through. But this time the airline worker was not having it. It was a packed flight, we were boarding last in economy and it was just a shit show. I got through just fine first with my little backpack, but I could hear the argument from the boarding tunnel thingy and it  was getting heated. I was about to go back and try to smooth it out but my fiancé rushed pass and just boarded plane, I assumed not having heard it super clearly that the attended had given in and let her on. That was not the case! 

So we found our seats and settled in. I was pretty tired and I could tell she was upset so I just kinda tucked into the window and put my hat down and tried to take a nap. But soon after the airline worker and a cop shows up and they are not fucking around, and want her off the plane. She tries to plead and cry, etc. but they are not having it. And maybe in a moment of panic or just plain self preservation...the cop asks if we're together, and I blurt out, ""NO!"" shaking my head emphatically. I got kill dagger eyes from her as she shot up and grabbed her bag and followed the cop out. She was also swearing and screaming the whole way out.

Now, obviously this is well after the event I'm posting this. But when she did eventually get home (she caught next flight out with the bag checked, lol), I was there to pick her up. She obviously thought I was the asshole, and to be honest almost everyone I know thinks I'm an asshole except my boss and co workers, who for context were very much relying on me to be back on time, which I gave my word I would, for a really important project that was time sensitive. They were all very happy I didn't get thrown off too. 

So, am I the asshole for this self preservation?

AITA?",17055,z3rekr,"Honesty, I was ready to rake you over the coals. But now I’m thinking NTA. This isn’t like your fiancée had an anxiety attack over fear of flying. It sounds to me like a full-on grown woman temper tantrum, which only happened because she didn’t listen to your travel advice.

AITA for kicking out my BF and his daughter after she used my photos for her scrapbook?,"I started seeing a guy roughly a year and a half ago. He has a 9yo (almost 10) daughter named ""Chrissy"". I have an 11yo son as well. We met each other's kids 3 months back and last month they started having weekend visits here. It's been a super hard adjustment for me especially. The kids get along for the most part but I'm just having a really hard time. My son has always been a fairly good kid and hardly ever given me issues. He never drew on walls or broke anything of importance or talked back (aside from occasionally, obviously, no kid is perfect) and he was always super quick to ask permission to touch my stuff. I personally think I lucked out and I knew that not all kids were as well behaved as my child but I wasn't ready, I don't think. I'm just overwhelmed. 

So, since she has been doing weekend visits here (she stays in my guest room) she has destroyed a lot. Rips holes in the mattress and then says they were already there (they weren't), draws on the walls and windowsill with make up and marker, she even takes my new feminine pads to her room and will cut them up. She has put a hole in my wall and said it was already there. I can buy a brand new thing of shampoo and conditioner and it's 100% gone and in the trash by the end of her shower, which lasts 45 minutes every single time. She stomps her feet and slams doors when we have to speak to her and knocks things off the walls. She is generally a good kid but she is so fucking destructive. 

What really set me off was her coming here this weekend with her dad (my son was at his father's) and I was called in to the office to do a signing which would only take roughly an hour max. So I left them here without me. Well, when I got back she was sitting at the kitchen table with all my photo albums laying in front of her, cutting out the faces and everything else on these photos and gluing them to her ""scrapbook"". Photos that I cannot get back, as they were printed out YEARS ago when I was in foster care and those were the only copies I had. Photos of my dead friend as well. I went to my BF, who was on the phone outdoors and told him they needed to leave, explained the situation and told him I was fucking done. Those photos, as stupid as it may be, were a huge part of my childhood and now they are destroyed. I told him I was done speaking to him about his daughter destroying my shit and it was time to go. He thinks I'm an AH for throwing a year and a half down the drain over some pictures. Am I?",17048,x54lub,"Holes in mattresses? Cut up pads? Wasted shampoo and conditioner? Holes in walls?

Those arent accidents,  that's all done on purpose.

And the pictures? That's deliberately malicious.

Either daughter has some serious mental health issues or she is trying to break y'all up. Or both. And her dad enables her,  then probably wonders why he cant keep a girlfriend.

Be done with them and don't look back.

AITA for not bringing step siblings to a road trip and telling one she's a stranger?,"When I was 16 and my brother, ""Tyler"", was 19, our parents got divorced. It was extremely messy. They fought each other constantly in and out of courtroom and their favorite weapon against each other is me. Tyler was already away for college 3 hours drive away, so his dorm and then apartment was my favorite place to run away to whenever I can get away from it all. Before the divorce we weren't particularly close, but now we're about as close as brothers can be. He could've just turned a blind eye on me, but he didn't, and I owe him a hell of a lot for that.

It's been 5 years since then. Both our parents have remarried and we now have several step and half siblings from both sides that we never met (all younger). I didn't have anything against them personally, but Tyler and I prefer to keep our distance away from the drama. Our parents, however, still push us (mostly me) to be all buddy buddy with their new kids. Maybe they still want to use me as a one-upping tool against each other. Like they're on a race to get us to act as a big brothers to their kids. I don't know for sure, all I know is I'm not interested. Again, I didn't have anything against them personally before all this.

I'm about to graduate college soon, and Tyler wanted to take me and a couple of friends along for a cross-country road trip to celebrate (I go to his old college while he got a job in the city after he graduated). We didn't think it was possible to do anything like that with how things had been for the past two years, so I'm super excited for that. We've been preparing things for a while just so we don't run into problems later, and I've been documenting things mainly through Instagram story. I didn't realize on of our step siblings already followed me before I set my account on private a couple years back.

Words got around, and now everyone started demanding we take our steps and halfs with us, even changing the trip to make it more kid friendly. It's all kinds of absurd and entitled so I admit I lost my temper by the fifth time I was called about ""being a good brother."" It was my mom's oldest step daughter (18) and she has been the most insistent out of everyone. I yelled at her that the only one who gets to call me a brother is Tyler, and she and the rest of her dad's spawn are less than strangers to me. I went about as well as you'd imagine. Tyler and my friends thought it was both hilarious and long overdue, everyone else thinks I'm an asshole. Am I?

Edit: first of all, holy shit. Thank you for your judgement, opinion, stories and advices. It'll take a while until I can read them all, but I will eventually.

Second, I'd like to give some additional info based on the most common questions/speculations I've seen so far.

Mom and dad cheated on each other and remarried quickly within a year post divorce. Saying I've never seen their new kids is an exaggeration (not for Tyler tho. He actually never even met them), but beyond the forced bonding sessions (like twice each that I can remember?), I always tried to synch up my stay with their turn to stay at their other parents' or, if I can't swing it, I'll go stay at Tyler's for the weekend to avoid them as much as possible. Children in question are::

From mom: 18f (step. The annoying one, also the one who followed my ig). 13m (step. Asked once, backed off after I said no). 5f (half. Never whined directly but mom said she's been crying over this).

From dad: 17m (step. Haven't called but have sent a couple dms I don't open), 4f and 4f (twins. Half. Dad's pushing for me to take them both a couple hours after 18f started being annoying)

I have no idea how exactly the news spread from 18f to the rest of them, but it annoyingly did.

Hope this helped clear things up. Sorry if I gave you a wrong impression, but I wasn't in the best state of mind when I wrote the original post.

EDIT 2/UPDATE: Hi... so some people still reach out to ask what happened after this post, and I'm not really sure how to post an update here. So I hope this is okay.

First of all, I wanna thank everyone for their perspective. Now that the emotions are no longer running high, I'm a little surprised that most of the more reasonable comments got downvoted. Thank you for validating my frustrations, but I have to agree with the gentle ESH voters despite the final judgement. I'm not obligated to bring anyone on me and my brother's trip, but the way I dealt with the whole situation came from a place of anger and hurt. I've gone (and still go) to therapy for the shit my parents put me through, and while I've made some progress, my parents and anyone related their bs still bring out the worst in me.

With that in mind, here's what I did about the situation:
1.18f step sister: I texted her my apology for what I said and how I said it. I, however, reiterated that Tyler and I will not be inviting her. I asked her to extend my apology to her brother if she told him about what I said.
2.17m step brother: I opened his dms, and replied with a polite but firm no.
3.Mom and dad: I emailed them that I made a mistake by thinking a carefully-kept distance will be enough to have at least a semblance of a relationship with them. I told them that I should've listened to Tyler years ago and just cut my losses just like he did. I asked them to lose my number and email because I won't have anything to do with them anymore.

I blocked my parents' numbers and set their email to spam box, but not my step siblings'. I did, however, remove anyone I don't recognize from my ig followers. My parents' new/other numbers are still getting blocked, but I only ignore my step siblings' (only 18f at this point, really). 

I won't engage with her meltdown, but I won't close the door in her face either. I don't think I'll ever be in a place where I can be to my step and half siblings what Tyler has been for me, but after a closer introspection, I don't think I'm ready to completely end that possibility either, no matter how impossible it seems to me right now.

That's all, I guess. Thank you again, from both me and Tyler. He's been very smug since I showed him the post. Whatever. He's earned that right.",17051,ujlsnc,"NTA, the aholes are your parents trying to impose some kind of faux family bs on you .Take your trip, have a damn good time ,and  forget their nonsense.

AITA for labeling my drawers to end MIL's confusion?,"So, I have a really sweet MIL (DH's mom) and we get along most of the time. However, when she visits our home I notice that she goes throw my drawers in the bedroom looking for a charger or something. I find it a bit invasive and embarrassing especially when she opens the ""wrong"" drawer that would have personal.items in it like lingerie and then goes on to complain about how uncomfortable it is for her every  single time. We've gone back and forth on this and when I stated that she was wrong for even looking at personal stuff she said she got confused and didn't know what drawer had the item she looked for. DH suggested I should just bring her whatever she needs instead of having go inside and look herself but she never asks!.


So I decided to label my drawers...meaning I put a sign on every drawer to eliminate dear MIL's confusion. for example I put ""socks"" sign on the sock drawer, then ""lingerie"" sign on the lingerie and underwear drawer, electronics, makeup drawer etc. you get the idea?. The next time MIL visited she walked into the bedroom looking for something while I was in the kitchen cooking. Minutes later she came in with my husband asking about the signs I had on each drawer. I told her I just labeled each drawer to end her confusion and help her find what she's looking for quickly. She looked offended and said that she was niether a small child nor stupid to be treated like this. I said I was really trying to help and also try to prevent her from seeing ""stuff"" that upset her in the past. She got madder and kept arguing then left to stay at my BILs house. BIL called and berated both DH and I and then DH lashed out saying I caused this mess and I needed to apologize.",17036,um6zr0,"NTA - your MIL should not be rummaging around your drawers in your bedroom to begin with, no more than she would want you to be rooting around in her drawers at her home.

AITA for making my MIL believe I was having an affair?,"I (27f) and my husband (26m) are big gaming addicts. Our parents hate that we played games, and we have got in multiple fights as children and adults over our hobby. It is a sore subject in our family, and we have opted to lie and say we are outside if anyone asks what we are doing.

We both work from home, and right after work we proceed to play games until midnight. None of us like leaving the house, so we are practically next to each other 95% of the time. There is no humanly possible way for either of us to cheat on one another. 

I am currently pregnant, and this has caused our inlaws to visit very frequently. Due to this increase in visits, we have reduced much of our gaming time for the better health of the baby and so they do not see us gaming. We have gotten in argument about how our hobbies are ""unacceptable"", ""childish"" and that we needed to change. Sundays are known to everyone as the ""unavailable"" day. We always say we are on date or something, but in reality we are at home getting our weekly gaming quota covered.

My husband went to a gaming cafe with friends vising and I stayed home last Sunday. MIL decided later to call me in the middle of a match, and I suppose I was acting very suspicious because I wanted to end the conversation asap. She asked what I was doing and I replied automatically without thinking that I was on a date with my husband. According to my husband she then later called him and he said that he was at a bar with friends.

MIL decided to visit my house, where I was undoubtly in the middle of another game. I avoided any phone calls and pretended to not hear the knocking until my match was over (20 minutes or so). Afterwards I answered the door and pretended that I was sleeping which is why I wasn't answering the phone or door. MIL exploded at me calling me a cheater and that the child I was pregnant with was not her sons (because otherwise, why would I not answer the door?). The idea that I would cheat, and that it would even be possible to cheat on my partner was so hilarious to me that I burst out laughing which angered MIL even more. She continued to berate me while I just smiled sitting there thinking how ridiculous all this was. When my husband came home she berated me in front of him about how I was cheating on him. My husband was visibly confused the whole time, and confirmed with his mother that there was no possible way for me to cheat on him. He explained how we are together practically every moment of the day and when MIL saw he was not getting on her side proceeded to get mad at me for leading her on. She called me an asshole for pretending to have an affair and never correcting her before she told other people.

Although I never clarified that I wasn't cheating, I do think that it was not her place to come unannounced and proclaim that I am a cheater. AITA?",16975,wtwe0s,[deleted],3299,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wtwe0s/aita_for_making_my_mil_believe_i_was_having_an/
"AITA for taking my daughter to the restaurant my stepdaughter ""forbid"" us from?","Hi.


I f36 married Jeff m39 2 years ago. He has a daughter (Alicia - 16) from his previous marriage and I have a daughter (Morgan - 12) from my previous marriage as well.


Alicia isn't closer to me nor Morgan and she always has something to be upset about. for example, when me and Morgan moved in with her and Jeff, she tried to control where we can & can't go. What areas I was allowed to redecorate and put my furniture in, what room Morgan got etc. Her excuse was that she wanted to keep the house how her mom left it as much as possible. Jeff asked us to be more patient and she'd come around eventually.

She did come around, but still tries to control other areas of mine and Morgan's life. I had a million conversation that ended up with her throwing a tantrum. Jeff talked to her and told her to not try to control what Morgan and I do, ever. And she agreed.

Morgan's birthday was days ago, We planned to celebrate at a restaurant and let Morgan choose which one. She picked a really nice restaurant that isn't over the top expensive and we agreed the party would be there. However, When Alicia heard which restaurant we were going to she went off on me and Morgan and said that we can't go to that restaurant because she had tons of memories there of her ""perfect old family"" and she won't let us taint the memory for her. I found this beyond illogical and unreasonable. I told her she could stay home but she said it wasn't about her being there - it was about the idea of me and Morgan being there with Jeff as ""family"" when it used to be her, her mom and Jeff. We got into an argument and Jeff told me to tell Morgan to just pick another restuarant but I snapped and told him Alicia had no right to dictate where me and my daughter go and he shouldn't be encouraging her. He told me he wasn't encouraging anything, just trying to keep all parties satisfied. He told me to get Morgan to change the restaurant or he won't go..That was it for me, I decided I wasn't going to change it just because they wanted me to and ended up going with morgan to celebrate with just my mom.



Morgan of course felt upset her stepdad missed her birthday celebration. when I pointed this out to him, he argued that I literally gained nothing by insisting on this particular restaurant and upseting Alicia (who is refusing to speak to any of us even him) and ruined his relationship with Morgan. I said it was Morgan's choice but he said I was the adult in this situation and have failed to navigate through it.



AITA for still going to the restaurant although Alicia forbid us from it? I just wanted to make Morgan feel like she has a say and right to spend her birthday however she wanted.


EDIT no her mom is alive. I don't know why some here assumed she's deceased. She's alive and Alicia sees her weekly.",16969,vbc5jb,"Your edit about her mother being alive was helpful because those behaviors about the house and special places would be more understandable and expected if she lost her mom, before I saw the edit I assumed her mother had passed away based on her reasons and behaviors.

AITA for not letting my husband sit with us during girls night in?,"


My husband (35) is disabled, he's in a wheelchair and is home 24/7. Because he needs me around to assist him, I'd have him and his chair nearby while I do laundry or cook or clean. He's with me most of the time except for when I go to the bathroom, but even then he'd complain about me being away for so long. I don't even go shopping, everything gets delivered to our home.


I haven't seen my girlfriends for a while and have arranged to start having girl night ins at my place since I can't be away from home, especially at night. I asked my husband for some ptuvacy when my friends come and he tookit badly, took it as in I was annoyed and bothered by him but I assured him it wasn't like that. He said if it's true then I'd let him sit with us during girls night in. I absolutely refused and tried explaining that my friends and I need privacy and this is the only time we spend together. I also explained that having him sit with us would ruin the purpose of girls night in. He threw a hissy fit and called me selfish and rude for refusing. He started giving me the cold shoulder saying until I agree to include him, he will not be speaking to me.


AITA for choosing ""this hill"" to die on according to him?


More context^ I haven't gone out in a while, haven't seen my friends or even family in a while because he wouldn't go with me and also refuses to stay home with someone else to look after him. He even wouldn't let me be out of sight for more than few minutes. I sometimes have to bring him near the bathroom so he coukd wait for me with the DOOR OPEN if I'm taking more time. He isn't sociable by nature, so he doesn't have friends. The onky 2 friends he had showed their true color after he became disabled and put a distance.

About the girls night in issue. He said he would not let my friends in if I continue to exclude him which caused a major argument between us.",16952,yk386s,"NTA, and sweetheart, you need respite care. You cannot be alone together forever. You need to get out of the house and see other people, and so does he, no matter how unsocial he is. And you both need privacy from each other.

It is rough and traumatic adjusting to an acquired disability, but your husband is doing it all wrong. He's so twisted up in grief and loss of control that he's turned in on himself and is both lashing out at the world and controlling the only thing he can - you. And that's not healthy for either of you. He does not get a pass on abuse/coercive control just because he's in a wheelchair.

Ultimately if you cannot get this marriage back on a mentally healthy footing, you will need to leave and get yourself to safety. And if you feel he's getting violent, please leave immediately. 

But if you think his attitude is still fixable, then reach out to family. Reach out to a local disability charity. Find out what social care options/funds for home independence adaptations you qualify for. Find out whether there's things like adapted cars that he can relearn to drive. Get him mental healthcare to ease the transition from able-bodied to disabled. If he has PTSD or depression, get it addressed. Work out if he really needs 24/7 nursing care or if his problem is figuring out accessibility. And for goodness' sake, reclaim your privacy in the bathroom!",2289,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yk386s/aita_for_not_letting_my_husband_sit_with_us/
AITA for refusing to help my parents even if they end up homeless with serious medical conditions?,"I (28F) was raised by super religious parents. It was a fight to be able to go to a normal college and not a Christian one with weird rules. When I did that they said they will not he paying for my schooling untill I ""come back to the right path""

After struggling for a couple of months a friend told me that the strip club she was working at was hiring. I have been dancing my whole life and have a good figure so I was hired pretty fast.

A few months in I dropped out of college because I was making serious money ( about $3k for a bad week and up to $11k for a really good one). When my parents found out they disowned me. The same goes for all of my extended family except for 2 cousins.

Fast foreward 9 years, I own my house outright, a Tesla, don't have debt, I also own an appartement building that I rent (stripping has a short lifespan) and investments.

Now my parents contacted me. Apparently my father lost his business during COVID, my mom has always being a SHM, they declared bankruptcy and are really struggling (they live in an old camper). Also apparently my mom is diabetic now and my dad has always had heart problems. They wanted my help.

I said no, I don't have parents anymore. And furthermore according to their religion and church my money was earned while sinning so to use it is to damn your soul to hell and I really didn't want that for them. My mom started crying and my dad said that they didn't know where they went wrong with me.

That was the last of it from them, a couple aunts and uncles called but they changed their ""family helps family"" tune very fast when I asked why they weren't helping them themselves.

But now a couple of weeks later I am starting to feel like I was an AH to them. Because a month's income from stripping would make a really big change for them but I won't even miss it that bad.

So AITA?",16957,u2q50n,"NTA. They disowned you. And now they’re only contacting you because they need help. No to make amends for their horrific actions. And you’re absolutely right. If the rest of the family lived true to their words they used to guilt you, your parents would have help and a place to stay in a heartbeat. They’re hypocrites. They all need to apologize first and repair the relationship (if that’s even possible) before any help is considered.",5013,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/u2q50n/aita_for_refusing_to_help_my_parents_even_if_they/
AITA for feeding my dog table scraps from a dinner my boyfriend made for us?,"I(24F) have been dating Jay(28M) for four months. He is handsome, smart, funny, well-educated, has an awesome job, and is a sweetheart. Sunday he had a whole day planned for us. We were going to walk a nature trail and then go back to his place for dinner he was making. I was so excited because it was going to be the first time I'd be at his house. Since we were hiking he said I could bring my dog Shelby with us.

He made us a roast and some vegetables for dinner. I finished my plate before Jay did and took it to the kitchen. There was still about half the roast left and it was close to Shelby's dinner time so I took half of the half of roast and some still raw vegetables from the fridge to put on a plate for Shelby. I was carrying the plate to the back door with Shelby to feed her outside and Jay asked me what I was doing. I told him feeding Shelby.

Jay said something like ""Well that's not dog food."" Jay knows I mainly feed Shelby a raw diet. I opened the door to put the plate down for Shelby and Jay got up, took the plate away from her, went to the kitchen and came back with it wrapped up in tinfoil and told me to leave. His excuse was that he made dinner for me and him, not me, him, and my dog and that I should've asked before I helped myself since he would've used his leftovers. I did leave but not before telling him that he made that meal for us so I could do with some of it as I pleased and he knew damn well how I feed Shelby. I tried talking to my friend about it later that night but she said Jay was right to be upset but this friend has never really approved of how I treat my own dog so I feel like she was probably a bit biased and the wrong person to ask.

AITA for just feeding my dog like I normally would?

Clarification: She does NOT get restaurant food daily, I eat out maybe 4 times a month. If what I eat is dog safe or the restaurant makes food for dogs on request, THEN I bring some home for her. Shelby's daily meals are a bit of brown rice, raw vegetables, and ground chicken hearts and beef livers. The hearts and livers are boiled just enough to kill bacteria and that is all with the approval of Shelby's vet. I asked Jay how he prepared the roast so I could know if it was safe to give her. That's also why I got her fresh, unused vegetables from the fridge.

Update: I accept that Im the AH for what I said and did to Jay. Some of these responses were harsh but I see now how and why I was entitled. Thanks to people that responded to the actual issue. Others going on about her diet, thanks for the concern? but I came here to ask about Jay. Not get into a debate about dog foods. Shelby's been on her diet for 6 years and is a healthy and active puppo, that's all I and my vet need to know. As for Jay, I apologized to him and he did accept my apology but he broke it off. He said it was the last straw for him over me doing things without asking first. He has talked to me about taking things off his plate or his drink without asking before. I've tried to do better but keep slipping up. I didn't realize I was that bad about it so I'm going to work on myself for the next guy. For people that said not going to his place for 4 months was a red flag, that was my decision that he respected. I don't want to go to someone's house or them know where I live the first few months of dating and getting to know each other.",16928,xjb6mi,"Lmao you're clinging to the idea of feeding your dog a raw diet to deflect. Please think objectively about what you did. You took a sizeable portion of roast (which isn't raw) and then *went into the fridge for Jay's groceries* to feed your dog. He made you dinner. He didn't say ""help yourself to all the food in my house for your dog"". Raw vegetables in the fridge are not table scraps (neither was the pot roast directly from the pan). Table scraps are the good left on your plate, what was uneaten of your portion *at the table*. Maybe he had other vegetables in his refrigerator so he could make himself food later in the week like??? What even were you thinking?

AITA for taking my oldest child to my sister's child-free wedding?,"I'm *still* shocked this whole thing happened, but I want to hear some outside perspectives... so here I am.

I have 4 kids (11, 14, 16 and 19). A while ago, we all received an invitation for my sister's wedding. That's me, my husband, and all 4 of my kids. Her wedding was in a different country but it was at a good time so we could all go. We booked everything and were all ready to go.

We got there a bit of time before the wedding. Quite literally *a few days* before the wedding, I was informed it was going to be a child-free wedding. Look, I have no issue with child free weddings. But, I was a bit a frustrated. I mean, if I had known it was going to be child-free, then arrangements could've been made so that we all didn't have to travel. We were all invited, so I was just annoyed that things were switched up. But, I can also understand that weddings can be stressful and sometimes things are going to change. I spent quite a bit of time trying to find a place for my three youngest to stay during the wedding, but I sorted it all out eventually.

Okay, it was wedding day, no more changes had been made, everything was good. We were on our way when I got a message that my sister was excited to see 'you two'. I was a bit confused, because, of course, three of us were going. I just decided it was probably an error and didn't worry. We got there, and my sister seemed very surprised to see my oldest. And not a nice 'surprised' either, a pretty condescending 'surprised'. But, again, it's her wedding day, she's probably nervous, I'll let it go. During the wedding, I couldn't help but feel she was ignoring us... I don't know, if none of this ever happened I wouldn't even care because, again, it's her wedding and she doesnt have to pay equal attention to everyone. But with everything else, it just felt weird.

After the wedding, she sent me a message that it was nice to see me there, but she would've appreciated if I had respected the 'child-free part'. I replied saying i was so happy for her and enjoyed every second of the wedding, and I thought I had respected it but if there was a miscommunication I was very sorry. She told me that there was no miscommunication, that I had disrespected her and I should apologize. I basically reiterated what I had already said, and didn't apologize. AITA?

EDIT: For those wondering about the invitation/RSVP: The invitation said '<bride and groom name> would like to invite <all 6 of our names>' and we were all asked to RSVP by email (which I did), I had also seen my sister between this and the wedding and it was clear she knew we were all planning to attend.

And yes, this is about my 19 year old - I used the definition of 'child' as son or daughter, not as under-18. Sorry for the confusion",16898,sddrxs,"You took the 19 yo? That's not a child. And if she really wanted it to be child free why didn't she tell you before you flew your entire family?

"AITA for uninviting my SIL and MIL from everything and saying that if my husband continues to pressure me, he will also be uninvited?"," I am 7 months pregnant with my first child. The baby is also the first grandchild/nephew of my husband's family which everyone is excited about.

 I lost my mother and father to the pandemic, being an only child, so there's not much of my family. Since the death of my parents (1 year ago), my husband's family has welcomed me with open arms as part of them and I have become very close to my MIL and SIL. 

I always wanted to have a gender reveal and I trusted my SIL to organize everything about this.

With 3 days to go before the party, I started to receive messages from all my husband's relatives and even close friends congratulating me on my baby being a boy. 

I went to ask what happened, my SIL confessed that she let it slip to my MIL and she told everyone the sex of the baby after knowing, because she couldn't hold it and it took proportions beyond what they imagined. Nobody call me to tell this. 

The party was canceled and I was heartbroken, as well as extremely hurt by the two of them.

 Usually they accompanied me to the ultrasound, shopping for the baby' room and my MIL would stay at the time of delivery. 

But after this breach of trust, I stopped inviting them and asked them to respect my boundaries when they pressured me to go. Honestly, I didn't even send them the baby shower invite, because I really avoided contact with them as much as possible. Because everyone knew before me that it was a boy. 

My husband started complaining that I was pushing them away because of a mistake that could happen and that I was being harsh. 

Yesterday he brought up this and when I said that I still didn't feel comfortable with them, he said ""Soon you'll tell me that my mother won't be able to go to the birth "".

 I think my face showed my response and he started saying I was being too hard on her because she was just excited and blabla. 

I had my limit and said, ""If you keep pushing me, it won't just be your mother who won't be on my labor. So either stop or you won't come in."" 

He started to say that I was crossing lines and that he had a right to have this moment. I was taking this with  them too far. 

He slept on the couch and doesn't talk to me more than necessary. 

AITA?

Well, many are saying it's just a gender reveal. I honestly don't care for that and I think it's tacky, but my mom was the type who like/love it and she always dreamed of having grandchildren, she said she was made to be a grandmother. She can't meet my son or even know I'm pregnant, so I wanted to do something tacky that I don't care for her, not for me. Everyone knew the importance and the reason. I always wanted to have a gender reveal with my mom there  and I didn't have either.

Extra:

Let's go to some points:

 - At no time did I say that I would never approach them again. But RIGHT NOW, I don't see myself doing that. I already have grief, pregnancy hormones, and day-to-day stress to deal with so I don't want anything else to bother me. 

- Obviously I want my husband to be in childbirth. But it's a lot of stress, he brings this topic all the time and I doubt he'll stop even at the time of my delivery trying to convince me. Even if he goes, if he says anything about his mother coming, I'll ask him to leave.",16907,ygw927,"NTA

AITA for moving out without informing my roommate and possibly causing him to lose the place?,"First I would like to inform you that I am on the Autism spectrum, if you are going to use sarcasm in your comments please label it as I have difficulty distinguishing it even while written. Also feel free to give it to me straight, I am not a fragile person.

I (22M) have been living with a roommate for close to 5 months now. I am not on the lease. The rent and utilities are too much for my ex-roommate to handle on his own.

I have a tick you could say, I count. And by that I mean I count steps, stairs, lightposts, sips, bites of food, pillows... It helps me cope with the stimulation of the world.

When I moved in I made it clear to my then roommate that he was not allowed to touch my food (I meal prep) since 1) I can't eat anything I or my family didn't cook and 2) while cooking I tend to count the individual pieces of food (think how many chicken chunks, how many pieces of vegetables...) And if while eating the numbers don't match I tend to get overwhelmed.

He respected that for the first couple of months, then he started stealing bites. It stressed me out and I would talk with him, at first he used to deny it then he apologized and promised to never do that again. A couple weeks later he would do so again.

5 days ago I got home after a very stressful day and took out a container of strawberries, when I got the end of it it was 3 strawberries short. I had a meltdown. The first in more than 4 years.

After I managed to calm down and feel better I called my parents and asked to move back in while looking for another place. Packed my stuff and was out by the next day. I did not inform him of my moving. And he had an upfront month's rent so I did not need to give him anything (I actually gave up 3 weeks of rent)

He did not even know I moved out untill today, and he called me panicked about his situation, I told him that he was bad for my mental health and I will no longer be living with him and I am blocking him from everywhere after we hang up. He called me an AH and told me that he will become homeless because I couldn't spare 3 measly strawberries.

I am bad with human interactions and judging situations accurately, so AITA in this situation?

Edit: thank you all for your comments and for explaining what I did wrong. I calculated how much money I need to send to make it an even 30 days of rent (including the days I moved out and didn't tell him) and venmoed it to him.

Also for some people here and in my messages telling me that I should live alone because I can't handle roommates: I lived 4 years with 3 other roommates, including all of 2020, and that while going to college and working. I am someone who is confident in myself and what I reached in life so it didn't shake me, but please don't say the same thing to someone else, what you see as a throwaway comment can seriously break someone's trust in themselves.",16896,sremsx,"Hey, fellow spectrum peep here.

AITA for cancelling my daughter's date,"FYI: I am a single dad and have been for 11 years. Her mom essentially just ran out on us

My daughter Victoria is 14 and she's a great kid, makes me a proud dad, but, as the teen years as arrived, we've certainly had our fair share of disagreements over grades and clothes mainly. Unfortunately, she's interested in boys now, and they're interested in here, God, if you're listening, send help.

Normally, when she says that she has a date, I'm fine. I meet the kid, they go on their way, that's kind of my rule. I don't do some goofy "" If you don't have my daughter home at 9:00 on the nose, I'm coming hunting for you""  big scary dad speech. I wanna just meet the kid so I can put a face to a name.

A few days ago, she said a guy named "" Vince"" asked her out, fine. Well, Friday night came and I get told from Victoria that oh, he's "" not good at talking to parents"" and "" doesn't like to do it"".

Sarcastically I said that I loved hearing that and that I was at ease hearing that this guy actively avoids parents. She's got a PhD in my sarcasm so I received an eyeroll. I said he could use tonight as practice for talking to parents. She said that he doesn't have to do anything he doesn't want to. I said if he's not meeting me, she's not going on the date. I got a foot stomp and a "" thats not fair"". I told her I wasnt being overbearing just wanting to meet this kid.

She told me she was going to do what she wanted. I told her to text this guy that the date was off and go to her room. She started crying, sent her text, told me she hated me, went to her room, and slammed the door a few times.

AITA?",16889,w6opv4,"NTA, my mom was the same when I was a kid. She would let us do pretty much whatever within reason, but she wanted to meet their parents before we could go inside their house to play. 

We HATED it back then, but now we're grateful to have had a mom who gave a damn. We might have been latchkey brats who didn't come home until dark, but she knew where we were.  

If the guy doesn't want to meet you, that sucks for him. He's apparently old enough to come pick her up and take her out, so he should be old enough to introduce himself and hurry themselves out the door. 

It's suspicious and makes you wonder if he's older or if he's hiding something a parent could spot but a teenager would overlook.

AITA for charging a bride more for make up when the og price we agreed was lower?,"I am a makeup artist for the past 9 years. I charge $500 for bridal makeup, around 250 for bridesmaid etc makeup but for regular party makeup I charge around $150.

So few weeks ago a lady had booked me for a party makeup on June 25th. She booked at 10am. I went there thinking I'd do a regular party makeup. I had agreed $150 with her.

As I was there, there were some people coming over. I assume relatives. At some point it slips from a woman about the wedding and I realise the woman I'm doing the makeup on is the bride. I'm doing a bridal makeup charging for simple party makeup.

I was completely pissed how she lied about the occasion but I kept doing my job. After we were finished. She gave me $150 and I notified her we are actually $350 short. She asked what I meant by that and I said that I did a bridal makeup. You're the bride. That's what I charge for bride's. She said we had agreed on a simpla party makeup and that I am basically ripping her off because I worked the same amount of time and used the same products as I'd use in a bridal makeup so the title of the event shouldn't matter. I told her she doesn't get to dictate how I form my prices. She then refused to pay me at all and called me a scammer and told me to get out. Before I left her mom threw $200 on my face and told me to get lost.

I was telling what happened to my friends and they all sided with the bride and said that unless I used more expensive products and I did extra labor then I'm not justified in charging her more and since she requested party makeup I should just charge her that.

AITA for telling people exactly why my girlfriend wasn't at my brother's wedding?,"I don't care if my family recognizes this, but using a throwaway because I don't want them following back to my regular account. 

So first off, I'm a girl, and so is my GF of 4 years (obviously). We're both mid/late twenties, shared finances, live together, planning to marry and buy a house, etc.  This is relevant later. 

When my brother sent out wedding invites, only my name was on it. I asked Dan and he said that because of COVID, they were restricting numbers and no one was getting a +1. Fair enough, no problem.

Anyway, I get there on Saturday and everyone has a +1. Even my cousin who's only been casually seeing this guy for like a couple of weeks. It's obvious why. This isn't the first time GF's been treated differently, but it's the first time it's been blatant beyond plausible deniability. I'm furious, but I grit my teeth, smile, and get through the ceremony.

At the reception, my family immediate notices GF is missing and asks about her. I was going to say she was sick but then I decide you know what? fuck it. I just said ""She wasn't invited. Gee, I wonder why?"" I wasn't shouting, but it was pretty clear I was bitter. Shortly after that, my brother and his new wife come storming over. She's sobbing and he's whisper-shouting threats at me so I left.

Now my immediate family isn't talking to me except to yell at me, and the rest of my family isn't talking to them except to yell at them. My mom insists it was a mix up/misunderstanding with the invites. My dad wants me to apologize because, even though though it was wrong to exclude her, it was their day and I shouldn't have made it about me by causing drama. 

Dan and Maddy are being shunned by half the extended family, and the other half are split between being on their side or staying neutral. My mom thinks if I apologize and tell everyone it was a misunderstanding I can smooth it over, but I kinda don't wanna. AITA?",16865,sizqem,"NTA

AITA for bringing my baby to a child-free wedding?,"My cousin lives a 6 hour drive from me and the rest of our family. A few months ago we all drove over there for his wedding. Due to limited space, no children were invited to the wedding except the bride's young nieces and nephews. 

My baby was 10 months old at the time and I wasn't comfortable leaving him alone in an unfamiliar place with a stranger, which was a babysitter that my other cousins hired for their own kids. So I decided to bring him to the wedding. I wrote on the RSVP that I was bringing him but he would be sitting on my lap and I would bring my own food for him. My cousin didn't say anything so I assumed that he was OK with it.

My baby cried at the ceremony but I quickly took him out of the room. At the reception I had him with me the whole time in a body carrier. He didn't make much of a fuss and I thought everything was OK. 

After the wedding my aunt (groom's mom) confronted me and told me that I was rude for bringing my baby without permission. I explained that I wrote on the RSVP what I was planning to do but my cousin didn't object. She said that my cousin and his bride had a problem with it but the bride didn't want to start any drama because she doesn't know me well. 

My other cousin's baby was 7 months old at the time and my aunt said that he had no problem leaving his baby with the ""certified"" babysitter and I should of done the same.

AITA for wearing a first gen sash to my graduation against my dad’s wife’s wishes?,"Hi all, longtime lurker but first time poster. I (27NB) am graduating from law school next weekend. As backstory, my parents are divorced and remarried. 

Things with my father’s wife “Kelly” have always been tense. They got married when I was 16 and the long and the short of it is that I ended up moving back in with my mom due to her. Bluntly, Kelly is also someone who is very hard to like. She’s abrasive and quite rude at times. We have never gotten along but I have for the last 8 years tried harder to be nicer to her for the sake of my father.

I went to law school three years ago and, at the time, Kelly was not very supportive of my decision and has commented on the fact that she “didn’t think I would actually see it through.” Well, now I’m graduating. I have a great job. I’m really proud of myself because I really feel like I got here on my own hard work. Kelly has never introduced me to anyone nor assisted with my work. In fairness, I also in no way expected her to. Kelly used to be lawyer (she is not currently) but it’s not really anything we have discussed due to not being close in the first place.

Now that I am graduating, my law school gave the first gen law students sashes to wear. My father called me today and I asked that I not wear this sash because Kelly is offended by it. She thinks that I do not consider her “family” and I am also therefore not a first generation lawyer. I got frustrated and told my dad that they’re both welcome to not come if it offends her so much because I am wearing my gen one sash. My dad got upset as well and essentially said that it’s not a big deal to not wear the sash and my sash is “invalid” due to Kelly being his wife, and thus my step-mother. We ended the phone call on a bad note.

AITA for refusing to not wear my sash for Kelly? I have tried to be diplomatic with Kelly, and I worry this may be the wrong hill to die on. I understand that it’s just one graduation, and I wonder if I’m making  a big deal out of nothing. On the other hand, I’m really proud of myself. No one else in my family is a lawyer and I will be the first. So Reddit, AITA?

AITA for leaving when my mom told me to move my car so her neighbor’s daughter can park in her driveway?,"Some backstory: my mom has always wanted a daughter. Instead she ended up with 2 sons and 6 grandsons. 

16 years ago, a young woman with a 2 year old daughter (let’s call the daughter Lily) moved across the street from her. She was a single mom and didn’t have any family in the area so my mom offered to help take care of the little girl while her mom worked/studied. 

Over the years, she’s become an adoptive mom/grandmother to this woman and her daughter. She was there when the woman married her husband and had 2 more girls together. She’s very close to the whole family but especially Lily. 

My mom was born and raised in Italy. My dad was French. My brother and I don’t speak any French or Italian. Lily is not only fluent in French and Italian but she knows more about the culture than me or my brother and she knows all of my mom’s recipes. My mom also helped pay for her private school tuition because she doesn’t like the public schools in the area. Lily, my son, and my nephew graduated from high school in may. My son and my nephew each got a card and a check for $300. My mom took Lily to Europe for 8 weeks over the summer. 

I got to my moms house with my sons last night. We planned on staying for a few days because we live 8 hours away. I was parked in the driveway, then right before dinner my mom told me I needed to move my car so Lily could park in her driveway. 

I said Lily could park on the street but my mom said no, the driveway is Lily’s spot and I have to move so I told my sons to get our bags and we went home. 

My mom has been calling me since last night asking me to come back and saying I overreacted to being asked to move my car. I refused and my sons and I are celebrating without her but I’m starting to wonder if I was the asshole for leaving when my mom told me to move my car.",16818,z3tn9l,"Info

AITA for getting upset at my gf for giving my mom a tattoo,"My(25m) girlfriend (22f) and I have been together for over a year. She’s covered in tattoos which I’ve always liked. She’s always been artistic and has been tattooing herself and friends for years.

My parents are more conservative and traditional so when they planned a trip to visit us I told her to just wear longer clothes to cover them up. She refused and on the day they visited she wore a crop top with shorts which showed off most of her tattoos. I warned her again before they came in about it but she just shrugged me off.

I was shocked when my parents came in and just started complimenting her on the tattoos especially my mom. My mom spent ages to her talking about tattoos so me and my dad went out to the backyard.

When we came back in my mom rushed up to my father to show off the tattoo my girlfriend gave her it was four small flowers running up her arm she said it represented our family. 

My dad loved it and my mom was busy telling everyone on Facebook about it, my girlfriend then came downstairs and I asked her why would she put that on my mom without asking me she laughed in my face and said my mom was a grown woman.

My parents then took my girlfriends side so I just stormed off upstairs. I could hear them for hours downstairs until my parents left.

They treated me terribly and sided with my husband completely. On multiple occasions they both told me to beg my husband for forgiveness even though we separated because of the way he was treating me. They made it clear that if we divorced, they would want nothing to do with me.

At the same time, they were doing everything to stay in my husband’s good graces, which made everything hurt twice as much.

My husband and I ended up reconciling and I admittedly cried to him when I told him how bad they treated me. Now my husband is pissed off with both of them and has cut ties both professionally and socially. 

My dad and brother have asked me to speak to him and mend things between them, as it’s hurting the family business. I’m still upset and I was feeling petty so I told them they should try begging him for forgiveness. Now they’re both angry at me and my brother said I’m being vindictive.

AITA for laughing when my ex's wife complained to me?,"Ex cheated on me with his current wife. That was 5 years ago. Ex and I share three sons who are 11, 10 and 8. Ex's wife has a daughter and a son with her ex, who she also cheated on with my ex. The two of them have said it all. From it was meant to be, to how great it is because the kids all have a bigger and happier family, blah blah blah.

I am over it in some ways. There is very much a sting that the affair partner in my marriage gets to call herself my kids stepmom. But I'm not at all sorry that my ex is gone. The man slept with her behind my back for 18 months before her husband and I found out. I am civil when the kids are around, I ignore them when the kids aren't around.

This whole thing happened over ex's parents. They were disgusted with him for cheating. MIL told him that he destroyed his kids foundation. That leaving a spouse is never easy and divorce is hard for kids anyway but when you add conflict in the way of cheating, you take something from a child that they can rarely ever get back, and that's parents who can still care about each other and want the best for each other despite not being together. They stayed very close with me and haven't welcomed ex's wife at all. Nor have they been involved with ex's life since really, or his stepkids. It bothers her a lot.

My youngest son won an award in school a couple of weeks ago. Ex and his wife were there. So was I. Ex's wife ended up coming up to complain to me because both mine and ex's parents showed up briefly, spoke to my son, then to me and left. She was saying how unfair it is. How her kids don't understand why ex's family have nothing to do with them and why they never see them but they know my kids have a relationship. She said ex's family love me, it hurts her feelings to feel not good enough. I'll be honest. I rolled my eyes first but then I laughed because she seemed to expect sympathy or help from me. Laughing at her pissed her off. I have heard from her and my ex since that I was rude, I should care about the kids at least, and I am not thinking of my kids when I keep bad blood between us and laugh at her suffering.

One part of me doesn't care and believes I'm fine once my kids couldn't see it. Another part of me wonders if I was an asshole to laugh at her.

AITA for wanting to be pay for babysitting my own daughter?,"My (39M) wife (34F) and I live in at a suburban house with our daughter (10F, Emily). Our neighbour next door (48M, Walter) is a single father with two daughters (14F and 12F). We have been living here for a little more than two years.

My wife really likes watching scary movies but I have never enjoy them. I get too scared and end up having a bad time so I prefer to avoid them. Her friends sometimes go with her to the more popular ones but she also likes older, indies and foreign horror movies. She has always had a hard time finding people that have this niche interest and that is why it was such a big deal when we met Walter and found out he also shares this tendency. They very quickly started to make plans to watch movies together. I was invited to be a part of this but refused.

I prefer to just stay at home babysitting Emily and Walter's daughter while they are in their cinephile reunions. Sometimes they go to movie theaters but other times they just stay at Walter's place watching stuf at his home cinema. They usually have to go to another town in order to catch a specific function of some weird movie so it is normal for them to come back very late.

They eventually started doing stuff outside of watching movies, like going out for dinner. Walter invited all of us, including the kids, to go with him to a restaurant that a friend of him owned but I said no because it was too expensive. I don't like that kind of places because I feel they are a waste of money and didn't think the kids would enjoy it either. I insisted on staying with the kids and let the two of them go be themselves. This has became a regular thing and it is in a way a good deal for me because Walter pays for my wife's dinner and she can't no longer complain about me not taking her to fancy restaurants.

As both their movie and dinner nights had became so common, I have grown a little tired of the burden of constantly babysitting the girls. I talk to my wife and Walter about it and he explained that he usually does not like leaving his duaghters with babysitters. He says he is really comfortable knowing that they are being watched by an experienced father like me instead of some teenage girl. He nevertheless agreed that it was too much of a load for me and offered to start paying me a standard babysitter fee each time he goes out with my wife.

I thought that was a fair approach to the issue but my wife was fully against it. She says I should not be paid for babysitting my own daughter nor the daughters of a close friend of our family like Walter. We have been arguing about this but she insists on this notion and it not open to change. She even gets mad every time I talk to her about this. Walter promised me that he will convince her but he does not seem to have been able to do so either.

"AITA: For ""upstaging"" my wife in our Christmas cookie baking tradition?","My (25m) wife (23f) and I have had a tradition every Christmas where we would bake Christmas cookies and frost them with out freinds. We'd then give the cookies out to freinds and family and helpers. 

Every year, my wife would take on the bulk of the baking duties, insisting that only she knew how to bake them ""right"" and only letting whoever is helping frost them. She always insisted on doing all the baking because frosting is the fun part and the only thing people want to do. Usually this frosting and baking marathon would last until the wee hours of the morning, and Sstart around noon.

Well, this year, for reasons that aren't relevant to this post today, she would not be available on the day we normally do all of this. She was sad that we wouldn't be able to do our cookie tradition. I said that I was more than capable of baking the cookies. She seemed to think I was joking and that I could bassicly never do it myself. Well, I said I'd try, and she wished me a sarcastic good luck.

Well, in the run-up to the days of baking and frosting, I  start running drills to optimize production. (Enter testing and tragic mistake montage)I started rearranging the house in various configurations, running tests on the dough we were using to see how long it took to bake and making appropriate changes while running it by taste testers, substituting ingredients for quicker bake time while preserving taste, making the cookies as thin as possible without comprising frosting ratio, canvas space for creativity, and/or comprising structural integrity, etc.

Come the day of baking, I have everything down to a science. As freinds and family come in, I give them the run down. After a couple hours most kinks are worked out, and cookies are flowing out at a breakneck pace. Eventually, we start running out of material! Something that never happened under my wife's Aegis. We start making runs to the store for the necessary raw materials to fuel our mighty cookie forges! 

By the time we were exhausted around 2 a.m., we had produced at least 5 times the amount of cookies we ever had before. 

Well my wife gets home a couple days later and is weirdly upset. She insists the cookies taste weird, that we spent to much money, and that I was actively trying to make her look bad by making so much more than her.

In truth, I ran blind tests to see if anyone could differentiate between our old recipe and mine, and no one could. I also only spent 40% more than years previous as I slotted in some cheaper ingredients and bought some stuff in bulk, and I had absolutely zero intention of upstaging her, I simply had the goal of ""maximize cookie production"" 

She says that even if I didn't do it on purpose that I should have thought about how it made her look to out circles and that I have embarrassed her, and she actually called me an asshole. She's never called me an asshole in all 3 years of marriage, so I can't help but think I am.

AITA for not putting my husband's children in my will?,"  My husband Jack and I married later in life – we were both in our 50s. It was a second marriage for both us. He has 3 children. I don’t have any biological children, but I am still very close to my former step-son Thomas that I helped raise. We were both very well off financially – Jack more than me. Jack owned his own business and was up front that he intended that business to be left to his children. We signed a prenup before our wedding that basically said we each get to keep what we brought into the marriage. We kept our finances separate though we both contributed to a joint account for household expenses – which we split 50/50. We did our wills at this time – Jack left everything to his children and I left mine to Thomas. We were both aware of what the other had done and we were fine with it.

Jack’s business went under about 4 years ago. He was desperate to keep the business going and poured all his savings into it. The business had been his grandfather’s and then his father’s, and he was determined to be able to hand it down to his children. He ended up losing almost everything. He was completely devastated. Standard of living wise not much changed except that I am paying 100% of household expenses. I love him and I am fine with this. 

I had a health scare about a month ago where I realized that if I died, Jack would be left with nothing as my will gives everything I own to Thomas.   I told Jack that I was planning to change my will. My plan was to put a third of my assets into a trust for Thomas’s children (he has 2 currently that both call me Nana), a third directly to Thomas, and a third in trust for Jack. I would set it up so that Jack would receive a generous monthly check, but that after he died the assets in the trust would go to Thomas.  I did it that way because I want Jack taken care of while he is alive, but after that I want it to go to Thomas – not Jack’s kids. 

Jack is furious that his children aren’t going to receive anything. He kept pointing out that I have 3 step-children, not just one former one. Why are his kids getting nothing and Thomas everything? I should say that by the time we got together Jack’s children were grown. One already had a child and another was married. Other than the occasional holiday I have never lived with Jack’s kids.  While he is not mine biologically – Thomas  is my son in every way that counts. While I get along with Jack’s kids, we are not close at all. 

Jack is threatening to leave me over this. He keeps saying that if I don’t care about his kids that means I don’t care about him. I’ve told him that is nonsense and that I don’t respond well to ultimatums. We had planned to leave our assets separately before we were ever married, but now that he doesn’t have money suddenly he wants me to leave my money to his kids.

AITA for asking my sister to be a groomswoman?,"sorry if the formatting sucks, i am on mobile while typing this. 

so, my (25m) fiancée(24f) has never gotten along with my sister (18f). my fiancée has never liked how close i am with my sister, and it has been a cause of few arguments. 

i proposed to fiancée (“sarah”) a few months ago, and things have been going smoothly. in fact, i would say our relationship has never been better. 

a few days ago, sarah listed off to me all of the people she wanted as bridesmaids, and not surprisingly, my sister was not one of them. she said she was planning on asking them in a few more months to be in our wedding.

sarah then asked me if i knew who i wanted as groomsmen. i listed off a couple friends that sarah knew, “keegan, joe, sammy, etc.” and then, i said i wanted my sister to be one of my groomsmen. 

this made sarah upset. she said that it wasn’t traditional for a woman to be a groomsman, and that it would embarrass her. i explained to her that my sister was one of the most important people in my life, and she was going to be apart of our wedding. 

this made sarah even more upset, and she accused me of trying to ruin her wedding day, and she locked herself in the bathroom.

it’s been a few days since this, and we haven’t spoken at all. many of her family members have reached out to me and asked me to not include my sister in the wedding at all, and that sarah should be the most important woman in my life, not my sister. my mil even called me, telling me that i was making sarah depressed, and that i was a horrible person for doing this to my future wife.

my sister heard about all of this, and told me that it was okay to not invite her. 

i stood my ground and told all of them that my sister would be included, no matter what. 

aita for doing so?

edit: sarahs dislike stems from her walking in on my sister and i cuddling. sister had her head on my shoulder, and my arm was wrapped around her, which made sarah upset.

2nd edit: my sister is aromantic, and told me when she first came out that she would most likely never get married, and that made her sad. i told her she could be apart of my wedding, even if it wasn’t the same thing. i will never forget the look of joy on my sisters face. this is why i wont back down, for those wondering.

3rd edit: i am planning on calling off the engagement with sarah when i get home from work! my sister is more important to me than any miserable marriage. i will be home around 8 est, so lookout for an update around then

4th and final edit: hello reddit! this is gonna be a little long, so be patient with me.

i got home from work, and i told sarah we need to talk. she agreed, and we sat down in the living room. 

i started off by asking her why she had such a problem with sister being a groomsman, and also (as many of you suggested) if she had been sa’d or had any trauma related to that. sarah told me that she hadn’t. she went on to say that having sister as a groomsman was untraditional. she said, “men are groomsmen. woman are bridesmaids.” sarah also said she was uncomfortable with how close i was with sister.

i asked her to elaborate on this, and sarah implied that we had more than a sibling relationship. she said cuddling between siblings was something she had never seen, and that it just didn’t seem like something normal siblings did.

i assured sarah that nothing like that was happening, but she just didn’t seem like she wanted to accept that, and it just let to more arguing.

i gave sarah an ultimatum. we could go to couples therapy, she could try to repair her relationship with sister, and tell her family to stop guilting me, or we were going to have to call of the engagement. 

sarah blew up at me, and said she was going to stay with her mother. 

family in law is now completely pissed at me, and are sending me hateful messages on facebook lol, so i guess that’s most likely the end of sarah and i.

but to wrap things up on a good note: sister is planning on moving in with me :) her mental health was drained from this, so we decided to move in together.

One day a week, the family will unlock the door in the laundry room that leads to my suite, and thus I have access to the room for the day. I put my clothes in the machine, and shut the door to the suite so that I don't hear all that ruckus. There are stairs in the laundry room that lead up to the rest of the house, so I assume that is how they access the laundry room.

I had my clothes drying in the laundry room. All of a sudden I hear yelling from the wife and next thing I know, ambulance has arrived.

&#x200B;

I soon learn that:

1. Apparently their 4 year old opened up the dryer and climbed in.
2. Their dryer was faulty.. it doesn't shut off when you open the door. Yea.... So the kid was tumbling in there while the door was open and all because the machine didn't shut itself off when the door was opened. 

&#x200B;

This was last week and the kid turned out to be relatively fine.

But now the landlord and landlady want me to reimburse their son's ambulance bill and medical bill (they have no insurance), totaling  $8477. 34. Because it was my laundry that the kid climbed into. (Really??)

&#x200B;

I didn't think I was responsible because:

1. I am not in charge of watching their kid. I am paying an insane amount of rent to begin with, I didn't agree to babysit anyone in addition.
2. It is their laundry machine that is apparently faulty.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

But they insist and I am not sure. I went to a forum that was orientated towards landlords to see if I was really responsible. I was asked if they family ever raised rent. I have been living there for one year and 4 months, so no, I admit they did not raise rent when the lease was renewed after the first year. But still, they didn't do it for charity. I pay my rent on time everytime and don't cause a problem: I assume them not collecting a little extra is still better than the risk of trying to find a tenant that isn't trouble etc, atleast that was their thinking. Anyways, I am not planning to stay after the lease ends

Anyways I was told then by the landlords that I should be grateful that they did not raise rent and should pay up to be morally fair. AITA?

&#x200B;

EDIT:

Thanks for all the advice. Will discuss will a lawyer but don't think they will try to pursue this outside of guilt tripping me as I think they know that they don't really have a case.

To clear up a few things

1. Yes I do laundry once a week. I am a single person and a few loads for one day of the week is enough for me. To be fair to the landpeople, they have expressed letting them know if I need an extra day or whatever to do laundry. They seemed chill about that part. Idk, I've never taken them up on that offer.
2. I don't know how the kid got in. He's not that tiny like a newborn and the door doesnt take much effort to open. Idk, nor is it my responsiblity to know.
3. yes, that really was the majority of the response on the landlord forum. I didn't go into details, cause I didn't need to; I only stated what the verdict came out to be: that I should pony up to be ""fair"". Yes there were comments/discussion on the stupidity of the situation, there was some sympathy towards me. But the majority verdict in the echo chamber was(as to whether I should pay): Be grateful they didn't raise rent and pay up or risk being a leech/or to just be nice because ""dealing with tenants isn't easy"". Mind you, I've never caused trouble for them to begin with. Aside from having the audacity of drying my clothes in the 21st century in a machine where their kid can climb into, I guess.
4. And no... I didn't close the dryer on the kid wth? Im assuming he tumbled/went in as it was still running after he opened the door, and he had trouble leaving the machine as it was literally rolling him around inside.
5. I didn't question the medical bill as I am a graduate student on a long term exchange program from... Canada. I've never paid a medical bill in my life and just accepted the fact it would be expensive. .",16748,wrabay,"**NTA** 

Your landlords and the people at the forum are completely wrong.  It was not your responsibility to watch the child. They are the ones who were negligent by not watching their 4 year old child and having a defective dryer.",2221,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wrabay/aita_for_not_wanting_to_reimburse_medical_bills/
AITA for not inviting them to my Christmas party after they didn't invite me to their wedding?,"I throw a pretty big Christmas party every year going on a decade now. A few years ago at one I threw my friend Tara met my former co-worker Tony and they hit it off. They dated for a while, and two years later, once again at my Christmas party, she showed up with a ring on her finger and they announced for the first time that they were engaged. I was super happy for them.

They got married this spring. We didn't get invited.

When I was sending around my party invitations this year, I didn't see any reason to invite them back if they didn't think I wasn't worthy of making their guest list. I have known them both for years, basically introduced them, and they literally announced their engagement at my home.

It got back to me today that they're very upset with us for not inviting them this year, that my party is something they consider special and they think I'm being petty. A couple friends mentioned it was a smaller wedding and they feel like I'm just punishing them.

It wasn't though. There were probably 200 people there and I knew at least 50 of them, and I was a little surprised at some of the names that made the cut over us. I didn't make a stink about it or anything, but I don't see why I should welcome them into my home again after being snubbed like that.

My partner thinks I should just let it go and invite them back, but I don't see a reason why I should.

AITA?",16750,zsf4iq,"NTA. Normally I'd say that they can invite or not invite whoever they want to their wedding. But by that same logic, you can invite whoever you want to your party. You're upset they didn't invite you, they're upset you didn't invite them. 

The difference is they're using your Christmas party as a celebration of *their relationship*. They feel entitled to your Christmas party because it's iMpOrTaNt to their relationship, but they don't view you as important. They'll keep using your party to announce life events because they feel *entitled* to your party as a celebration of them.

200 people is *not* a small wedding, but if they think it is, you have 2 new friends you've invited and you just couldn't fit them in, too. So sorry, darlings, it's just a small party, you understand, right?",5926,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zsf4iq/aita_for_not_inviting_them_to_my_christmas_party/
AITA for trying to talk my friend out of taking a paternity test?,"My friend Nick and his wife Jess just had a baby. I’m close friends with both of them. The baby looks just like Nick, there is no question they are related. 

One of Nick’s friends is a bit of a mgtow type of guy and he brainwashed Nick into wanting to take a paternity test. Nick asked my advice on how to bring up this topic with Jess. 

I was shocked. I thought their relationship was good and they trusted each other. And the baby looks just like Nick! I started asking Nick questions as to why he thinks Jess cheated. What did she do that made him suspicious. He admitted that she didn’t do anything, but he needs this test to be certain. 

So I told Nick that it’s a bad idea and could really hurt Jess. She had an extremely traumatic birth, the baby was huge, she didn’t get an epidural and everything ripped. I think she might even have postpartum depression. What she needs is support and love, not accusations of cheating. 

He kept saying he needs this to be certain and Jess should be understanding. So I asked him how he would feel if Jess asked for a paternity test for him and Anna’s (his female best friend’s) baby, who was born last year. He said he would be really disappointed in Jess and it would make him rethink their entire relationship, possibly even break them up. But it’s different, because Jess doesn’t have to spend money on and raise Anna’s baby, thinking it’s hers when it might not be. 

Nick is now mad at me for not supporting and helping him. He says that I’m a woman and I could never understand how it is to the father and I’m not even trying to understand it… which is partially true. But I can say the same thing about him, that he is not even trying to understand how it is to the mother to be baselessly accused of cheating after such a traumatic birth. AITA?


Edit for clarification: 
Nick didn't have a baby with Anna (the best friend). Anna had a baby with her own boyfriend. I just tried to use that as an example, asking Nick how would he feel if Jess asked for a paternity test on them just to be sure Nick didn't cheat on her with Anna and fathered Anna's child. It was just an example hoping to make him see how hurtful accusations like this are.",16724,vjk7z3,"NTA.  
When you asked him about the other woman's baby paternity test he gets the point... then immediately goes ""but this is different!""  
If Nick is moving into this mode of being as a result of this other friend's influence, then that guy must really suck. New Nick is not improved.

AITA for canceling a girls appointment the day of her baby shower,"I’m (F17) a part time braider and I take my job very seriously because this is how I make money and this is what I want to do as a career. 

I work from 4pm-10pm on weekdays and 8am-8pm on weekends. School is my first priority and on weekends enjoying my weekend is important too. 

I have my policy on my booking link so before you even book an appointment you have to read my policy. A couple policies I have are No show=No further appointments,  30 minute grace period, after that your appointment will be cancelled, No extra people, etc etc. Most of my clients respect my “rules” and always come through. 

This girl “Tiffany” booked an appointment with me for June 4th at 3pm. She was getting a wig installed (no braid down just application) so I had another client right after her for braids. If you wear braids or do braids you know braids can take HOURS! Braids already take hours plus she booked a take down and shampoo so that’s extra time. 

It came time for Tiffany’s appointment so I was setting everything up for her and 3pm came and she wasn’t here, I have a 30 minute grace period so I wasn’t worried. After 15 minutes I texted her and asked was she still coming and never received a text back. It was going on 3:45 so I just took it as a no show and put all my stuff away and started getting the stuff ready for my next client. i texted Tiffany and told her, her appointment was canceled but she could come pick up her wig (it was customized and everything FOR FREE all she needed was someone else to install it for her). I never received a text back. 

My next client came around 4:30 and I started working on her head. Maybe around 5:30 ish my mom called me and told me I had a client at the door (I work out of my house) and to come see what she was getting at because she was cutting up outside. I stopped in the middle of my clients hair to go see who it was and it was Tiffany. 

She was trying to cuss me out, saying I ruined her baby shower and why was her appointment canceled so I explained to her my policy and that she wasn’t just 30 minutes late or even a hour she was 2 HOURS LATE and I couldn’t do her hair anymore. I gave her wig and sent her on her way. 

She started talking about me on social media and everybody in the comments are dragging me saying i’m unprofessional and not to book with me when i’ve been nothing BUT professional. If you can’t respect me and my rules you just won’t get your hair done by me, it’s plenty other hairstylist where we stay. 

My mom said i’m not wrong but i’m getting a lot of messages and she’s getting a lot of comments on her post talking about how “unprofessional” im being when I did nothing but respect her and her time. I’ve even had a client cancel an appointment after seeing her post. i’m losing money and clients over this petty mess and I know i’m not wrong. AITA?

update: I texted her privately and didn’t receive a response back so I took advice from some of the comments and mostly u/0biterdicta and commented under her post saying what they said in a comment and some other comments mixed together. She didn’t say anything back then the post was “magically” deleted :| I would like an public apology from her but i’ll just take the post delete as she knew she was wrong and just chock it up. I’ve never really had anything happen like this to me so a lot of the comments were really appreciated and I just want to thank all of you because I was honestly stuck on what to do. Being in this business at such a young age is hard but i’m doing it and I will have the business I foresee. Thank y’all so much and bless you. The positive comments really mean a lot and if I could do all of your hair for free I would lol. Have a good day/night. ❤️",16718,v7dlgw,"As a fellow hairstylist, absolutely fucking NTA.

AITA for not wanting to teach my boyfriend how to do chores?,"Just as title says. I'm 20F, and my boyfriend (23M) has always lived at home where his mom did most (all) of the chores. 

He moved in with me a few weeks ago, and asked me to help him 'learn' how to certain things. 

I started with cooking, I figured that would be one of the most useful skills to know for him. So every night when I'm cooking he 'helped' a bit, with me explaining why and how I do things. That has been the first two weeks or so. This week I told him to try himself without help, I found some easy recipes of foods that he likes, and left him to try things out. 

Every single night this week I've had to do a big part of the cooking. Because he ""doesn't know how to cut this"", ""doesn't know how to do this"", or ""it tastes better when you do it."" I'm tired of it. And that's just cooking, I've been doing almost all the other chores myself too. 

So I told him I'm done. That he'll do his own laundry, cook every other day, and do the dishes on the days he doesn't cook. That he can *ask* certain things, but only if he can't find the answer himself, and I won't show him / do it for him. 

He got upset because 'relationships are about helping each other', but I feel like he doesn't want to learn and just push things off on me. I've shown him how to make French toast twice, but he still claims he 'doesn't know how to do it'. I even wrote down the recipe! I just want him to put in some effort instead of expecting me to do it all.

I've talked this over with my mom, and she said I should be grateful he's even asking to learn. My boyfriend thinks I don't want to help him with anything. I think he's a grown man and shouldn't need his hand held the entire way, especially with simpler stuff. 

AITA?

Edited: it's not just cooking, it's also things like vacuuming / doing dishes. Which is why I don't think it's lack of confidence / not knowing how to do things. He's seen me vacuum. I've explained how to. He still wants me to 'show him'.",16719,td4bwc,NTA - this is weaponised incompetence. I wish I’d had your common sense and confidence when I was 20.

"AITA for calling my friend’s girlfriend a, “jealous, vindictive bitch?”","My friend, “James,” and I have been close friends since primary school. James has been dating, “Janet,” for 6 months. Janet believes women should be “all-natural,” which means no makeup, plastic surgery, tattoos, piercings or anything “superficial” as she puts it. I’ve only properly spoken to her a few times and she’s always brought it up. 

My girlfriend, “Nicole”  and I have been together for 5 years. For as long as I’ve known her, I've known that she’s very glam.   I’ve rarely seen her leave the house without makeup (though most of the time you can’t tell) and dressing up. Nicole  has a nose piercing, a few ear piercings, a few tattoos and is very candid about getting her nose done. 

She is everything Janet hates.

A few weeks ago, James invited us to his beach house for a relaxing week away from the city. It was going to be James, Janet, Nicole and I. I thought it was going to be a fun time and a way to get to know Janet a bit better, since Nicole and James are already great friends.

Nicole was reading a book and lounging in the sun when Janet asked her if she wanted to go for a swim, and Nicole declined because “she’s a terrible swimmer and did not want to ruin her hair.” The second part was a joke, but Janet scoffed and muttered something about Nicole being a “snobby bitch.” Nicole brushed it off.

During dinner, Janet kept insulting Nicole about everything. Nicole would speak and Janet would call her a “posh, pretentious brat.” or James would laugh at something she said and she would immediately turn to Nicole and say something like, “Men prefer all-natural women.” It made the whole dinner awkward and I asked Janet to stop multiple times. 

At first, Nicole was laughing her off or making a joke out of the whole thing but eventually it got so uncomfortable hat she left the table. Janet called her a “fake” and “sensitive” I told her to shut the fuck up before I left the table. 

Janet woke Nicole from her nap by pouring cold water over her and throwing her dresses in the pool to “loosen her up.”

We left as soon as we could.

James has apologised profusely for her behaviour, but I’ve told him that I wasn’t comfortable hanging out with Janet yet. He did ask me to apologise to Janet for “ruining her good time” and to help “resolve the conflict. He said once I apologised, Janet will. I refused, and I thought that he had accepted that. 

I ran into James and Janet at the store and James confronted me, asking me to apologise to Janet. He looked very desperate and I could tell that he really wanted me to apologise. I looked Janet straight in the eye and told her that, “I’m sorry you’re such a jealous, vindictive bitch.” and asked her to leave me alone.

I got a bunch of angry calls from James, calling me petty and hypocritical by name-calling Janet. Nicole thinks I should have handled the situation better.",16707,w9orxs,NTA not liking make up and tattoos and all that is fine but personal preferences should not be moral judgments on others.

AITA for removing the door to my son's room indefinitely?,"Yesterday while I was making lunch I heard a really loud sound, as if the ceiling was falling or a bookshelf had fallen. 

My husband (41M) and daughter (17F) were out, the only other person in the house was my son (16M). I was pretty sure he was in his room, which is at the opposite side of the house from the kitchen, so while making my way there I checked every room and everything seemed in order. 

I knocked on my son’s door and called his name, no answer. I must have knocked/called 3 times before trying to open the door which was locked. 

At this point I was getting really freaked out, thinking that maybe he tipped his wardrobe or bookshelf and it had fallen over him and he was passed out on the floor. I was basically screaming his name, no answer. 

I have no idea how I did it. I just threw myself the door and it broke. Now, clearly the door was already weak (I’m thinking termite?) but, yeah, it broke. 

My son was fine. He was freaked out about the door but fine. The sound was his TV with the volume at the max, apparently. And he didn’t answer me calling because he didn’t want me bothering his movie. His words were “You were screaming like a harpy and it was annoying, I was trying to watch the movie. Fix the door.” 

I said no. I wasn’t going to fix it since to “fix it” I would have to buy a new door and doors are expensive. And as soon as his dad got home he would remove the door entirely as it was too broken to just stay there. 

He got really mad. Said it’s his “right” to have a door, he deserves his privacy. I said he had a door and while I was the one that broke it and it was a consequence of his actions, so if he wanted a door he would have to buy it (I know he doesn’t have the money for it right now). Until then, no door. He can change in the bathroom. He said fuck you, I said he was grounded. 

AITA about the door? My husband is fine with it, says only I know how scared I was, so only I can know the appropriate punishment. I’m now terrified that if anything happens where we really need to reach my son, we won’t be able to. But I have calmed down since and I’m wondering if maybe I’m the asshole.",16686,zwfkrv,"INFO:  If the tv was that loud, did you not hear it when you were at the door?",703,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zwfkrv/aita_for_removing_the_door_to_my_sons_room/
AITA for expecting my son to share his room?,"Background: My (40sf) husband (40sm) and I bought a 3-bedroom house a few years ago, shortly before the panini. We of course took the master bedroom, and the other two bedrooms went to our children (then 12f and 10m). We put a very nice double bed in the larger room, and a single bed in the smaller room, and told them both that they could choose their rooms, but whoever ended up in the larger room may be asked to share or relocate for visiting family members, while whoever ended up in the smaller room would have it to themself always. 

We almost never have family over (hubby and I are both only children, and our parents are in other provinces), so we were surprised when our older daughter chose the smaller room, and our younger son chose the larger room. But ok, they worked it out between themselves, both seemed happy with the choice, so ok. And it has remained that way for a couple of years. 

Now, we have a 4-day weekend coming up (my kids are now 15f and 12m), and my mother decided to come down to visit. Of course, we told her ok (my husband and I), as we hadn't seen each other in awhile, and I told our son (with the larger room and bed) that grandma would be here for a few days, and would be using his bed. 

Well, my son threw a fit. He didn't want to share a room with grandma, not even on an air mattress, not even for 3 nights, she smells funny. So we reminded him of the original deal, and offered to put the air mattress in the living room, but that wasn't enough, he'd have no privacy there. His sister offered to let him put the air mattress in her room (which she wasn't required to do), and that wasn't ok either. My husband and I offered to let him put the air mattress in our room, and he said no to that (because sharing a room with your parents, yugh! god bless the privilege, but whatever). 

Finally, I put my foot down and said, the condition of you having the bigger room was that you'd give it up for visiting family members. So one way or another, you're sleeping on an air mattress for 3 nights. You can choose if the air mattress goes in your room or our room or the living room, or literally any room in this house, but you are sleeping on an air mattress while grandma is here. 

Shortly after that confrontation, my husband came to me and suggested that we encourage my mom to stay in a hotel. I asked him who was going to pay for that hotel, since she can't afford it, we can't afford to put her up, and he went silent. Now he's calling me TA for forcing our son to give up his room for all of three nights, and suggesting that I tell my mom not to come at all since apparently ""none of us can afford it"".

Edit: I sincerely appreciate everyone's comments and judgements, but I have officially reached the point where every time I look at my notifications, it adds 2 every second without me even having to hit refresh. Clearly I should've posted this on my main account, since apparently reddit karma is important in some way. Lol.

To follow the common AITA trend and respond to some common themes:

1. Why don't I offer my own (and my husband's) bed to my mom?

My husband has back problems, so also cannot viably sleep on an air mattress. I will not be going into detail on this. I also assume that it will be incredibly obvious to everyone why it is not viable for my husband and my mother to sleep in a bed together while I sleep on an air mattress. Not to mention that she would never allow me to give up my bed for her as a visitor. 

2. Why doesn't my mom sleep on the couch/air mattress? 

She's 83 years old. Need I say more? 

3. Anything involving my son and daughter switching rooms.

My daughter is willing to help in the short term, but she seems a bit smug right now about the overall room choice, so she has no desire to switch rooms. And I will not force her, because what kind of parent would I be if I hold my son to the letter of his deal, but go back on my word to my daughter? You may decide I'm TA, and I'll accept that, but I am not a hypocrite. 

4. I am fully aware of the privacy a 12yo boy requires, we've had that conversation, and (at the prompting of a couple commenters), I have also recently asked my husband if there was a private conversation between him and my son that would in some way change this situation. He said no. Since I do not currently have any reason to believe my husband would lie to me outright, I'm considering that conversation closed.

5. Rip my dms, apparently? Lol, I didn't know that happened to 40-something married moms, but please know that I am not interested.",16646,ydt2w5,"NTA - you made the conditions clear and now he isn't happy they are happening to him.

For context: I am the oldest of three and had a similar arrangement - I chose the biggest and best room (after my parents) which also had a bathroom next door that, essentially, became my private bathroom. The arrangement was that I was always the one who had to give up the room to guests (also because I got a double bed).

While I didn't love giving up my room I understood that was the price of having such a good room to begin with. Also I usually would give up my room for 1 or 2 weeks at a time - a four day weekend is nothing. 

You son got the room he wanted and is now looking to re-neg on the deal. You have given him various options but it is clear he simply does not intend to keep his word. Your husband thinks the person to compromise to his tantrums is your guest but there is another option: he loses the room entirely and it goes to your daughter going forward.",8316,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ydt2w5/aita_for_expecting_my_son_to_share_his_room/
AITA for telling my niece why I kept a distance from her and her parents growing up?,"I (42M) have a niece Lily (18F). Lily is the result of an affair my ex fiancee had with my brother while we were still together. I was led to believe Lily was mine throughout the entire pregnancy and almost signed her birth certificate before my ex confessed out of guilt that Lily was probably my brothers. We did a DNA test and Lily wasn't mine. During my teens I got into an accident which left me infertile, the doctors said my chances of fathering a child were slim to nonexistent so you can imagine how crushed I felt when I discovered that not only I'm not going to be a father but I was also betrayed by 2 people I loved.

Its been years since and I did well for myself. I'm the first in my family to attend University and I landed a high paying job right after graduation, I own my own business, invest in property and since I'm both single and childless I can spend my income however I please. 

My ex ended up marrying my brother, I'm somewhat cordial towards them but I can't bring myself to fully forgive them for what they did. And although I know Lily is blameless whenever I see her I'm constantly reminded of how I was once overjoyed with holding her in the hospital thinking she was mine, so I can't bare to look at her for too long. I didn't visit her growing up, didn't take her on fun trips or give her lavish gifts like I did for the rest of my nieces and nephews. I wasn't mean or hateful to her but I will admit I kept my distance.

When my oldest nephew turned 18 I decided that I will pay for his college education since I could efford it while his parents couldn't. I even rented him one of my apartments for cheap so he wouldn't have to worry about money and could focus on getting his education. Since then I did the same thing for 2 of my other nieces.

Last week Lily approached me during a family event and inquired if I could pay for her education, I told her no. She then called me a jerk and asked why I was so distant towards her and her parents to the point where I couldn't even do her the same favor I did for the rest of her cousins. I told that her parents have enough money to afford her education and asked her how she could possibly expect me to be ok with watching my ex and brother who had an affair behind my back play happy family in front of me. After that Lily got quiet for the rest of the event and left early. 

I later got a call from my ex yelling at me for ruining her family, apparently she and my brother didn't bother telling Lily about what they did to me all those years ago and now she is knows she is so angry at them that she decided to go live with her bfs family. I'm starting to feel guilty that I told her the truth since it affected her more than I thought it would, but at the same time she is grown enough to know the truth and I don't think I could've lied to her face even if I wanted to. AITA?

Quick edit/update

For those asking why it was so hard for me to look at Lily all those years, here's a couple of reasons to sum it up:

1) My ex and I began dating when we were 13 and broke up when we were 24, so 11 years. She knew about my infertility issues and how much I wanted to be a dad and still led me on to believe the baby was mine.

2) I named Lily when she was born since I always liked the name and wanted to name my daughter that, my ex didn't change her name even after it was discovered she's not mine.

3) My brother and I look alike, Lily looks like my brother and as a result she also looks a lot like me. If my ex didn't tell me back then I wasn't her father I wouldn't have suspected a thing.

4) Having to witness a child that looks like me, has the name I chose and was being raised by the woman I loved for so long, all the while being infertile really made it impossible for me to be an active part of Lily's life like I was for her cousins. Not out of resentment to her, but for the sake of my mental health. 

I decided to listen to some of your advice and text Lily. I asked her if she would like to meet up and have a conversation about all that went on since like you said she does deserve some answers, she hasn't replied yet, if she will I'll update.

Update

I've met up with Lily yesterday. I told her about my relationship with her mother, how and when it started, went into detail about the accident I went through, the cheating, her birth. I got over everything she asked me about. In turn she told me everything her parents told her about me growing up.

Apparently she was told that around the time she was born I had a miracle baby named Lily that died at the hospital and since she and her share the same name I held some sort of resentment towards her. I am still processing what she told me. I feel like it's such a twisted retelling of what actually happened that it's insulting.

Needles to say there was a lot of crying involved and apologies from both ends. Lily said she's doing better now that she knows the truth and that her bf and his family have been an amazing support to her throughout all this.

My family decided to officially cut off any contact from my ex and brother, now that Lily is an adult there is no need to also invite them along so they can see her. 

For those asking me if I go to therapy, yes I do. My therapist was the one who suggested I distance myself from Lily and her parents all those years ago and honestly it did do wonders for my mental health so I can't say I regret that decision. I was suicidal back then and I don't think regular contact with them would've possibly done me any good.

I decided that I'll try my best to be more involved in Lily's life now that I don't have to interact with her parents inorder to meet up with her. Lily agreed and said she also want to get to know me better. 

Overall this whole incident opened up a lot of old wounds but I'm glad it happened. It needed to happen. All I can say is that I hope that both Lily and I will probably heal from this and move on with our lives.",16634,vndfzl,"On the fence. You're entitled to your hurt and anger and resentment.  No doubts about that!!

The ex bitching you out...well, if she had told the truth and not invented a ""miracle baby"" she wouldn't be in this position.  She got what she deserved,  brother too. Hope Lily takes a long time to get over this.

As for not doing for her what you did for the cousins...its not fair. Yes, I get it's your money and you can do with it what you want...but put yourself in Lily's shoes. She's grown up all her life knowing you didn't love her like you loved your other nieces and nephews and she did nothing to deserve that!! She deserved the truth and now that she's an adult she needed you to be a true uncle and be on her side, regardless of how you feel.  She is just as betrayed as you were...by the same people. Unfortunately,  these are the people who are supposed to protect her from shit like this. 

I'm glad you and her tried to work it out. I'd like to give 2 suggestions if possible.  If you think you were messed up by these 2 a@@holes...think about how messed up she is. Like I said, ultimate betrayal shouldn't come from your own parents.  She need counseling too. She needs to k ow how to Navigate this too!! Can you help her? Since she's not talking with her parents,  she's on her own now. Same with college. Now she has to either suck up to mom & dad or she has to find a way to do it on her own. Now is a perfect time to step up to the plate and be the uncle, and substitute dad you always wanted and she obviously needed. 

My prayers to both you and Lily.  I hope you both heal!!! And may the fleas of 1,000,000 camels infest every orifice of her parents!!!",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vndfzl/aita_for_telling_my_niece_why_i_kept_a_distance/
AITA for going to get ice cream instead of going home after my flight landed?,"I hadn’t seen my husband in a month as I was staying with my sister. He promised he would pick me up from the airport and we would spend time together but he sent his brother instead. I was upset even though my brother-in-law told me something came up which is why he was there instead. I asked him if we could go and get ice cream before we went home. He didn’t seem to want to go but I suggested I take an uber if he had plans so he agreed and we went and got ice cream. The entire time we were there he was on his phone and it felt like he was trying to rush me. 

When I finally got home my husband was there and annoyed. He wanted to know why I hadn’t come home immediately and said he had cleared his schedule for the evening so we could spend time together like I had asked. I told him I assumed he was busy since he didn’t come to the airport but he’s still upset with me and with his brother for taking me to get ice cream.

AITA for refusing to do a gender reveal cake for someone,"My 23f ex husband 35m and I have 1 year old twins together and due to a lot of complications from that pregnancy I got a partial hysterectomy. We divorced during my pregnancy after I discovered he cheated on me. He’s a good dad and his girlfriend is now pregnant. He cheated on me with his current girlfriend but she didn’t know he had a wife at the time, and I firmly believe that.

I run a pretty successful baking company in our small town and I do custom desserts including gender reveal cakes. 

My husbands girlfriend called me and asked if I would be willing to do a gender reveal cake for them and said it would mean a lot of “the mother of her baby’s siblings made the cake for the party.” 

I told her I had to think about it but eventually told her no. I am admittedly incredibly bitter at my ex for cheating on me while I was bedridden and medically fragile being pregnant with his children, and I don’t want to be involved in the celebration of their new child. I did specify that it wasn’t her, but I couldn’t do it and she said alright and hung up. 

My ex then called me and told me I was being rude and unreasonable and completely unprofessional putting our issues before my business. I told him I was allowed to refuse service to anyone and hung up on him.

I feel like I have let my feelings get in the way of my business and if I made the cake it’s not like I have to be there to celebrate. 

On the other hand, I do feel like I’m allowed to refuse business however I see fit.

AITA for telling my neighbour to get over it when I wake her baby up?,"My garage is about 3 metres away from my neighbour's bedroom where their baby sleeps. I've got a roller door which beeps quietly four times within 20 seconds of me arriving home and pushing the button. It's so quiet that at times I can't hear it when sitting in the room adjacent to the garage when my partner comes home. 

Since my neighbour had her baby, I've made an effort to be more considerate of noise. Despite already sound proofing my rumpus room, I've stopped playing my drums after 6pm. I've also declined hosting friends outside in my backyard due to noise. I think I've been more than considerate, but apparently not. 

I get home from work at 11pm and put my car in the garage. A couple weeks ago my neighbour approached me and asked if I could wait until the morning to put my car away, but I declined as there have been break ins to cars on our street lately. My car is also one that is targeted by thieves a lot as parts are expensive, and it's an enthusiasts car. I apologised but was firm when telling her that I will not, under any circumstances, leave my car out overnight. I also know that they sleep with their window open that faces my garage, but I thought it would be weird to bring it up and suggest they close the window. I'm also confused, as I have an after market exhaust on the car which is louder than the original but they have nothing to say about it. 

A couple nights ago I came home to her husband's car blocking my driveway just enough that I couldn't get my car through. It was kind of useless because I pushed the button before I even reached my driveway, so it beeped anyway. They didn't come out so I had their car towed and they haven't done it since. Today (Saturday) I decided to play my drums around lunch time in my sound proofed rumpus room. You can only hear minimal vibration from the kick from the outside, but it's at the rear of my property and quite far away from any neighbours but they still had something to say. The wife came over and basically said she had put up with my noise for long enough and that she was exhausted due to the kid never sleeping thanks to the noise I make. 

I was definitely still miffed about the driveway blocking situation from the other night and snapped a little, telling her that I'd been considerate enough and already made concessions in terms of noise. I said that while it's within my right to play music up until 10pm in our council, I've cut myself off at 6pm in consideration of her and her kid. I said that from now on she'll have to get over it because I was done catering to her and her family.",16613,uk5vke,"NTA. I’ve been the mum with a baby that wakes up at everything - neighbour mowing lawn, kids playing ball in their backyards, all of that. And although it’s natural to have a moment of thinking “oh for fucks sake”, you can’t control an entire neighbourhood to cater to one baby.  And there are a lot of tricks they can try if the baby is a light sleeper which are easy to find in the internet.

AITA for refusing to let my ex’s kid come with us to Disney?,"Alright, so I have a son(13M) with my ex husband. We got divorced because he was having a emotional affair which turned physical, and had a kid with the AP, and is a single dad atm as the AP left.

My son goes over to his house on weekends, and sometimes his kid comes over to my house because my son and him are somewhat friends, and I don’t really mind. 

The problem now is that I’m planning on taking me and my son to Disney as I’ve been saving it up for him as I believe he should go there at least once in his life to experience it, as well as him having good grades for the whole semester.

I believe that my son must’ve told his half brother, as my ex husband called me and asked me what day I’m planning to leave and am I driving or him. I was confused initially, but I realized what he was talking about, and told him that it was just gonna be a trip for me and my son.

He started to get mad and accused me of favoring my son over his half sibling and trying to be petty for his past actions, and such, and told me I should at least offered for his son to go too.

I told him no, as I wasn’t gonna pay for another plane ticket and other supplies, and that if his son wanted to go, he needed to pay for himself, I hanged up before he could say anything else.

Now my son says that his dad was ‘disappointed’ about my decision and to go try to ‘change my mind’ so his half sibling could have fun too and some other remarks.

My ex and a few of my friends who heard about the situation say I’m TA for not letting his brother go on the trip as well and that I’m being selfish and petty, so I’m starting to reconsider everything and just relenting, so I wanted a outside opinion.

AITA for not disclosing I had plastic surgery to my boyfriend?,"I (26F) have been dating Max (25M) for 4 months. When I was 22, I had a nose job as I broke my nose twice as a kid and it left it with a large bump. Then, at 23, I had a breast augmentation that bumped me up two cup sizes. These were life long insecurities that I was bullied over, and it was really relieving to get them done.

Onto the present, I met Max through a friend and things have been great. Last night, I was strolling through my social media while on the sofa with him. I stopped on an old classmates vacation photo, where she wore a bikini and frankly, had very obvious implants (she looks great, happy for her! But you can tell.)

Max glanced over at that moment and said “Gross.” I asked him what the deal was, and he said women who get implants or other surgeries are a huge turn off to most guys, and how men prefer natural over two balloons and how insecure she looks.

I couldn’t help but laugh and said “So you’re turned off by me?”

He got very confused and asked what I meant, I informed him I had procedures done before. He kept denying it and saying I was joking until I showed him old photos of me.

He got quiet and left shortly after. I got a text saying I should’ve disclosed this on the first date, how I led him on and that he needs to reconsider things.

It’s the next day. Haven’t heard anything, I’m bewildered.

AITA?

Edit: 

Alright y’all, I got a text from him a few minutes ago asking to meet up, as he thinks he wants to continue the relationship and wants to talk things over. 

After all these comments and some thinking, I sent back along the lines of his reaction made me realize he’s not the partner I’m looking for, and that I’ve decided to not continue our relationship. 

So yeah, I’m single now, kind of confused if I should mention this to future dates before were official to weed out any more like him? How do you even bring this up?

Oh well, I like me, I’m content with my natural and unnatural parts, and I’ll find someone who doesn’t have  huge hang ups on plastic surgery.

Edit 2:

I just woke up and there’s no way I can reply to all the comments I got overnight, but thank you to everybody for your opinions and thank you to everyone who’s wishing me well! I am sad, we had plenty of good times in those 4 months and I was hopeful about this one, but I’ll be alright. Time for a few self-dates to cheer myself up :)

Edit 3: 

He finally replied to my text: “I was hopeful we could start over on an honest beginning, but I guess only one of us is mature enough to look past each other’s shortcomings in the relationship. I’m glad you revealed this about yourself before I got too involved. Goodbye, good luck finding someone cause no real man would respect someone who can’t even respect their own body.”

AITA for refusing to look after my little brother for a week?,"UPDATE:
First off I want to thank for the encouraging messages, it means a lot to me.

I want to clear some confusions. I live in Europe, in a country where uni is free. I pay for my own apartment myself and am in no way dependent on my parents financially. So no, they don’t have that hanging over my head.

I called my grandma and explained the situation to her. She was on my side and encouraged me to talk to my parents. I called my mom and poured out to her that the situation doesn’t feel fair to me. She was quite upset at first so I hung up and called grandma again. My grandma then called my mom and basically told her off, which eventually led to my mom apologizing to me.
My grandma is coming to take care of James and I agreed to help whenever I have time. I am getting paid as well.

As for my parents I think it’s best that I go low contact for a while until things settle. I don’t want to completely cut off ties because I think family is still important. However I don’t think it’s good for me to be around for a little while as my parents seem to be upset still. I do feel bad about not seeing my brothers that much but for now I think it’s for the best.

——————————————————————————

So I (19F) have two brothers, 17 and 5 years old. Ever since the youngest was born, I have been expected to look after him quite a lot. I usually don’t mind but I do feel like a free nanny sometimes. My parents make it seem like he is my responsibility. My mom often yells that ”no one helps her with James (my 5yo brother) and I should take care of him more”. My father is away a lot because of his work, sometimes even weeks. 

This september I am starting uni. I have my own apartment that I will move into this weekend. (You should note that my parents have said to me multiple times these past few years that they can’t wait until I move out because I am so lazy in their opinion and never help out). So next week is orientation week for my uni. The uni is in my hometown so I am not moving far, just getting my own place. The orientation week is super important for getting to know the people you will spend the next few years with. It is also important to attend because all the important info will be given during this week. My schedule is quite packed for the whole week, days start at 10am and continue till late night.

The problem is that both my parents have important work stuff next week as well. My mom is flying abroad for work and dad is away the whole week as well. My parents said to me that they expect me to take James to and from daycare and spend the evenings with him, feed and bathe him and put him to bed. I told them that this won’t be possible because of my uni schedule but I can take him to daycare and depending on schedule help out. I reminded them that my 17yo brother is also capable of helping out, since he is still living with them and doesn’t have such a packed schedule that week and has more time to help out. My parents said that this won’t be possible since my brother has to focus on his high school studies and is too young. (Note that I would take care of James for whole weekends since 14yo).

I don’t want to be difficult but what my parents are asking from me is too much. They got really angry at me when I explained the situation and told me that I shouldn’t ask them for help ever again because they will not give me any. They are not offering me any money either for taking care of a 5yo for an entire week whilst pushing all my important things aside. I know for a fact that they sometimes give my other brother money for helping out but never offer it to me. I feel like they are in the wrong here but I might not see things that clearly. So, AITA?",16572,wxbnzq,"NTA. They have stuff planned that week, you have stuff planned that week. Their stuff doesn't take priority over yours. They made the child, not you.

AITA for “forcing” my parents to disown my gay brother?,"Context needed, obviously.

I (28F) hate my brother (30M). He was always the golden child (I was an oops baby and they never wanted a girl, plus I was a fussy baby compared to him, so I annoyed my mother). He hated me too and kept telling lies about me to my parents - if he stole something he would blame me and they believed me (edit: believed HIM. Insane typo, sorry) He sabotaged all of my relationships, he bullied me, he forced my friends against me. My parents always took his side. 

I left home for college (managed to get a scholarship) as soon as I could, he stayed in my hometown, renting a place near my parents, paid for by them of course. They stopped contacting me (our family group chat was always about brother and his achievements) and never sent me money. 

I live in another state now, married (my family was invited but didn’t bother showing up for my wedding) and with second baby on the way. My husband’s family is great, so that’s helping me a lot.

Anyways, my parents are very traditional. Male head of the family, tradition, all this crap. So my brother coming out shocked them. They absolutely demand blood related descendants to carry on the family name (I should mention that I and my kids all have my husband’s surname). Adoption is not an option, neither is surrogating, they accept only “proper marriage”. 

So, out of the blue, my brother contacted me. Apparently, my parents will disown him (he lives off their money, has never worked) unless he fixes the relationship with me (so that they can lay claim to my children) - since he is the cause I drifted away from my family (he isn’t the sole cause, I blame my parents). He actually flew to my state, cried a lot, blamed all the bullying on his stress from being in the closet, yadda yadda. I told him to f off. My family is dead to me and I don’t care about him. 

He is now saying how I’m petty, willing to ruin an adults life over childhood slights. Also that I’m homophobic, etc. But I refuse to be back in contact with my parents, as a back-up source of blood related grand babies now that their golden child “has failed” them.

AITA for calling the cops because no one picked up the kid I was babysitting?,"My boyfriend and I took his ex’s kid for a last minute overnight stay since the father of the kid cancelled on her. She had plans with her friends for the night and we weren’t busy so we took him overnight when the baby daddy bailed on her. We told her we had brunch reservations the next morning at 11 and while we were happy to help, she needed to pick him up by 9am. She knew this and agreed when she dropped him off. 

Well, next morning it’s 9am and she isn’t here yet. We text and call her with no answer. 10am rolls around and we try calling her again. She picks up in a very groggy voice and tells us she’s got the worst hangover and she won’t be picking him up until 2pm. We remind her of our brunch reservations and she tells us to take him with us! This kid is 2 years old, it is not enjoyable to take a child this age out to eat. My boyfriend cancels our reservations and gets ready to have this kid until she decides to pick him up.

I am furious at this point. This is not my child nor my boyfriend’s child. I call her and tell her if she is not here by noon, I would be calling the police to collect her child (she only lives 15 minutes away). She calls me a bitch. I then told her she had 30 minutes to come get him. I waited an hour and there was 0 sign of her. (We couldn’t drop the child off to her since she lives in an apartment complex that you need to have access to to get in.)

So I called the cops and told them I was babysitting and I don’t know where his parents are, they were supposed to be here 2 hours ago. They basically treated it as they would a lost child. They took him down to the station.

Little miss finally rolls up at 3pm and gets belligerent when she discovers I had actually called the cops and gave her child to them! She calls me all sorts of wonderful names and storms down to the police station.

Edit: we didn’t know where she was or if she’d even gone home. We also couldn’t contact the father since we had no contact information.

Edit 2: mother of the child is also neglectful and this was the last straw for us.

AITA for deliberately telling my FMIL the wrong name of our baby?,"I 23F and my fiancé 25M are expecting a baby girl next month, we’re really excited as this is our first child and we’ve been trying to prepare for parenthood. A lot of our family have been helping us with baby stuff and giving us general advice, they’re also really super excited for her! Especially my FMIL. 

She’s a very stubborn person and hasn’t really accepted me as apart of the family yet, she always tells my fiancé how he could do so much better than me and that he’s fallen into the trap of having “my” child. It’s hurt me a lot and my fiancé has had a talk to her about it but she still hasn’t apologised or anything so I just tend to ignore it now. She’s also one of them mums who posts every little detail of their life to Facebook like when my fiancé proposed she was straight to Facebook before we could announce it ourselves. 

Recently me and my fiancé have been coming up with names for our little girl and we both decided on the perfect name. A few days ago on a phone call my fiancé accidentally slips up by telling my FMIL that we’ve chosen a name. She’s been non stop messaging us and calling us to find out the name, we don’t want to tell her until the baby is born so that it doesn’t ruin the surprise and the whole of Facebook finds out before we are comfortable telling everyone. She tried guilt tripping my fiancé by telling him how he’s hurting her by not telling his own mother the name of her grandchild, that he doesn’t love him and that we (especially me) are gonna try and keep her from seeing the baby. I’m not sure why she would think that as nothing we have said has suggested it. To stop her from getting on my fiancé’s back I wrote a message saying that if she wants to know she can’t post it on Facebook, she agreed and I told her a fake name. 5 minutes later into checking FB. 

“I can’t believe I’m going to be a granny to baby Charlotte next month. So proud of (fiancé’s name) and his partner!”

My fiancé was furious and called her and told her that she was wrong to announce it. She said that she was so overjoyed by it that she couldn’t resist. He told her how that wasn’t even the name and that we aren’t gonna tell her until she’s born and hung up. Its been afew days and my fiancé has been getting texts from her saying that she didn’t mean and that I’m the AH for telling her the wrong name. Her words were “Who even tells their FMIL the wrong name of their grandchild?”.

AITA?

**UPDATE**

I want to start out by saying that I appreciate all the love and support you guys sent out to me! It was really entertaining to read everyone’s opinions on the matter and has restored my faith into thinking that everything will turn out fine for me, my fiancé and baby girl.

After posting this me and fiancé sat down with my MIL at dinner and spoke about boundaries. I wanted to start on a clean slate, I always give second chances and she has acknowledged it; aswell wants to get along with for my fiancé and our baby. So lets see how that goes! 
Also my fiancé has started referring to baby girl as Lottie (short for Charlotte) because he found it hilarious how this post blow up and maybe we might keep Lottie as a middle name, who knows? 

For those wondering if you’ve seen my post on my profile, my fiancé is still serving. I still intend to join and we’ve both agreed that baby girl will be looked after by my fiancé (when he’s not away) and my mum as I trust her with my life, whilst I go away for basic training. 

Again I appreciate all the kind words and I might or will probably do another update when Lottie is born!

**FINAL UPDATE**

Thank you for all the love and support sent my way since I posted this. It’s been amazing to read people’s stories that are similar to mine and all the advice that was given!! 

Here is the last and final update on this story. On the 9th August at 11:40am we welcomed Elena Beatrice June Into the world and weighing 7.3lbs. My fiancé was by my side the whole way and we could ask for anything more perfect! We wanted to wait atleast a few days before announcing it as we wanted to be in our own “bubble” of 3 before telling anyone else.
On the 13th August we announced to our friends and family that she was born and we were sent a bunch of congrats. My MIL was upset that we left her out of the birth but since meeting her, she has not really brought it up anymore.

AITA for refusing to let my stepson (17) have a PowerPoint project display in honor of his deceased mom at my wedding?,"

Basically the title. My fiance (42 and I (36) are getting married before the end of  this year (2022) He has a son (17) from his former marriage with his late wife who passed away from cancer. I'd like to think that my stepson and I have a good relationship. however he is the most sensitive and emotional kid I've ever met. I'm not saying that's a bad thing.....but it does make it difficult for me to deal with him sometimes.

He said he has already prepared a PowerPoint project in honor of his mom and is planning on playing or displaying it at the wedding. This was an instant no from me for many reasons. My fiance said we should let him because he just wants to remember and honor his mom. I told him that this occassion, the wedding has nothing to do with my stepson's mom so I'm not sure why put a whole Powerpoint project there at the wedding about her. it takes away guests attention and makes them confused. My fiance said we have to respect his son's wishes and also said he'll pay for the screen and everything. We had a huge fight about it and I refused to even consider it. the whole thing is just a no go. I even offered to have maybe few pictures or a seat as alternative but my stepson isn't having it.


Things have been pretty tense now. My stepson isn't talking to me, my fiance just keeps trying to guilt me into saying yes and it's all just making me feel overwhelmed.


AITA for refusing to make this happen? my fiance commented saying my refusal is an indication that I have an issue with my stepson's mom and that am being unfair to him since he spent so much time and effort to prepare this project that obviously...means a lot to him.

Side Note - This isn't about my stepson's mom. I don't have any negative feelings towards her. In fact I think that she was a fighter (battled cancer not once but twice) she played huge role in what my fiance has become now and I'm so grateful for that.

Edit: I'm sorry I wanted to put a link for something but failed. I was trying to show the size of the screen my fiance showed me earlier.

About my stepson's grief: When I first met him, he seemed to keep to himself and not attend any family functions. even when inside the house. He avoids spending time with family, is quiet most of the time and doesn't really talk much. I suggested therapy but my fiance said he mentioned this once to him and his son yelled at him telling him to stop acting like there was something wrong with him by bringing up therapy. My fiance stopped bringing it up and whenever I try to mention it again he'd shut me down hard.",16505,ug7j7l,A PowerPoint presentation about his mother sounds like a great idea for a memorial dinner/event on his deceased mother's next birthday.

AITA for crashing my wife’s birthday party and taking her home.,"My wife turned 30 this week. I’m 26M. We’ve always had a strong relationship and I love her so much.

My wife has a best friend from childhood Jimmy 28M. I didn’t know him that well but this year we’ve gotten to know each other and have gotten close. He’s my best bud and like an older brother to me in a lot of ways.

My wife goes all out for my birthday parties and I love them. She’s more of a stoic introvert so I thought it would be nice to throw her a surprise 30th birthday with just her and me and make it a special event. I wanted to make her a gift she would love. Jimmy’s an incredible artist and for the past two months I’ve been taking lessons from them. My wife was curious why I was spending so much time away from home with Jimmy but I made vague excuses because I couldn’t tell her I was making a gift for her. She’s made a couple comments but never seemed upset.

I told her a week before her birthday that I had made plans with Jimmy. I have a job with flexible hours so it’s not uncommon for me to do it.  She wasn’t upset or anything. When her birthday came, it was all I could do not to say anything. When she left for work, I put my plan in action. I decorated the place. I brought out the cake. I learned from youtube and stored it at our friend’s house. I got a dozen bouquets of flowers. I got her a few other gifts too. 

She was supposed to come home at 5:30 but she didn’t. I waited hours for her but she didn’t come home. I called Jimmy and he said he hadn’t seen her. I called her and she didn’t pick up. I checked her location and she was at a restaurant. I went to the restaurant and she was there with her friends. They were eating a birthday cake and she had presents. I never met these friends of hers before. I think they’re from her work. 

She seemed sad. She wasn’t smiling or energetic. I wanted to take her home and show her my gift so she would be happy. I came over to her and told her she had to come home. We grabbed her things and left. On the uber back, she didn’t say anything. At home she started crying. 

She has been sleeping on the couch and she avoids me. My wife hasn’t talked to Jimmy either. I told my mom and she called me an asshole. I don’t know why. AITA?",16487,z4o1sz,"YTA.

OP's wife: ""Nothing - I think my husband forgot""

AITA for going home when my wife didn't let me into the delivery room,"My (M28) wife (F29) gave birth a few days ago. We had what I believe to be a fairly standard pregnancy and I did my best to take care of things and make it easy for her. I took her to the hospital when she was due and her sister and mother met us there.

The problem started when she was taken to the delivery room. She asked the nurse that only her mother and sister (F27) be allowed in the delivery and then told me that she wanted me to wait until ""I've delivered and calmed down"" before letting me into the room. I was kind of shocked and didn't want to make a scene so I just said OK and sat down in the waiting room. We had not really discussed the plan for the hospital and I had no reason to think I wouldn't be there when my son was born.

I texted her sister if she knew my wife was going to do this? She said no. I told her to ask if my wife was concerned about something because I don't consider myself someone who would have made a fuss or made things more difficult for her. She texted back after a while saying that my wife ""just doesn't want you to see her like this"" and then added that she didn't agree with my wife and tried to convince her but ultimately it was her choice and I should respect it.

I sat in the waiting room for 6 hours getting minimal updates as the labor was fairly slow, and then I decided that there was no point so I texted her sister that I was going home, I'd meet my son when they brought him home and handle the birth certificate stuff the next day.

They came home about 9 hours later and I was finally able to meet my son. When my wife's mother and sister left she got very angry at me for leaving her at the hospital. I was angry too but I told her that we can talk about this in a few days because she's just given birth. She wouldn't drop the subject so I finally told her that she excluded me from the birth of my son for no reason, I didn't see the need to hang around a hospital waiting room for hours doing nothing, and that even her own sister thinks what she did was wrong. She said there could have been complications and I needed to be there, to which I replied that I wouldn't have been there because she kept me out of the room and the doctors would have handled any problems anyways.

She called me an inconsiderate asshole and has been talking short with me for several days. Her sister told me I should just apologize and move past it because it was a stressful time for my wife, but I think I'm owed a bigger apology first for how I was excluded from my own son's birth.",16471,t5z3wd,This is one of those AITAs that will end up on Yahoo or Good Morning America!,28,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/t5z3wd/aita_for_going_home_when_my_wife_didnt_let_me/
AITA for my husbands aunts tree being cut down?,"My husband rented his aunts home before we got married. He signed a month to month lease when he moved in. I moved in with him after our marriage because the rent was super cheap. 
My parents recently came to me asking if they could park their RV at our home.
I didn’t see a problem with this. Our yards are really big and there is space.
Because of city ordinance the RV has to be parked in the back yard. There was no RV gate in the fence. My husband went to his aunt and asked if we could install a rv gate? His aunt said no. My husband relayed the message to me and my parents seemed upset when I told them. 2 days ago. I came home from work and saw that my dad had a construction crew at our home and had removed part of the fence for the gate. There was a apple tree in the way. They couldn’t fit the RV in the yard. My husband angry told my dad not to continue and that they needed to repair the fence.
At this point I felt like it was pointless. The fence guys already built the columns for the gate. It would cost a lot more money to rebuild the fence. I told my dad to finish the job but make sure it was left super clean. That it looked nice. I planned on talking to the aunt later and explain what happened.
What I didn’t know was my dad told the guys to remove the tree. 
My husbands aunt came by and saw the tree cut down and started to cry. She has refused to talk to my dad or me. When my husband came home he found a 30 day notice on our door.
Terminating our lease. He tried to call his aunt and she didn’t answer the phone. He then called my MIL and she went to talk to our aunt.
Later I got several messages calling me an A for cutting down the aunts late husbands tree. I had no idea he planted the tree. Now my husband and his whole family are really angry at me. I never told them to remove the tree. I feel like I am being thrown under the bus here. Am I the A here?",16449,xncev7,"i kinda feel bad for your husband. first, his in laws stomped on his (& his aunt’s) boundaries and ignored a “no” to their request. then, you *told* your dad to “finish the job” but have the audacity to be *shocked pikachu face* bc your dad had the tree cut down to fit his RV which ***the owner of the rental had said no to storing on her property.***

like, i would be seriously thinking about if i wanted to be tied to people who disregarded my landlord’s refusal to be a storage unit and destroyed her property.

i’m betting that the fact that the landlord is your husband’s family may have made you and your father not bothered about the vandalism and destruction of property that he had done (& you had authorized).

UPDATE: WIBTA if I failed my student because she speaks with different dialect than I teach (language degree)?,"I figured that those who read the post would appreciate an update regarding the student you tried to protect.

I read your comments and you’re right, I would’ve been an ass if I failed her.

Her pronunciation is excellent and it would be a shame to force her to change it. I made my decision and I think you’ll be happy to find out what it was and how her exam went.

Had a chat with Ava and told her how well she’s done this year. I explained that students are taught specific pronunciation but there’s no correct/incorrect accent and we will not expect her to change it seeing how well she’s doing. But since we teach certain pronunciation, she’s expected to know pronunciation rules we teach and told her to just know the difference in pronunciation without actually having to implement it.

During her exam, she was asked a few questions regarding pronunciation differences and the rest was just the standard exam conversation and presentation. She was marked based on the dialect she speaks.

She passed with flying colors and, she doesn’t know it yet, but will receive scholarship next year for her grades. And going forward, we’ll make sure that students who speak with different dialect will get full grades as long as they know the differences in pronunciation between regions (which we require anyway but wasn’t part of the exam).",16445,uz20x6,It is nice when people listen and learn.

AITA for telling my wife that she can stay home this Thanksgiving?,"

My wife is a grade A+ picky eater. It's bothersome to a certain degree but on holidays basically the shitshow begins. She'd refuse to eat certain meals and mom would take it personally...which results in a series of arguments between them.


As a compromise this year, My wife offered to bring her own food to thanksgiving dinner. I was stunned I asked if she thought this through and she looked at me confused. I told her about how weird it'd be for her to bring her own food especially when she woudln't be sharing it with anybody else, and told her to think about how mom will react. She'd get very offended and upset. My wife said that it's not her problem and that she was just trying to make it work by bringing her own meal. I told her again that mom might not like nor even allow this. She blew up at me asking if I want her to either eat food she doesn't like or go hungry. I suggested she give my mom's food a chance but she said it wasn't about my mom's cooking, she just doesn't like certain foods. We had an argument and I ended up telling she could stay home this thanksgiving and have whatever meal she likes. She got quiet then lashed out on me calling me insensitive and negative to say this to her. I repeatedly asked her to calm down but she couldn't stop ranting about how I was basically willing to exclude her from a major event.

She started cold shouldering me about it while at the same time guilting me saying I'm treating her poorly after she offered the ""perfect compromise"".


Update: And so, my wife has decided to go spend thankgiving with her family (who by the way live HOURS away, so this means unnecesary travel expenses) instead and basically ditch me for a whole week. Y'all happy now? Though I appreciate some insightful comments on the situation. Some others?.....not so much especially with those assumptions claiming that my wife has allergies, SHE DOES NOT! Y'all get that from? But anyway. S'all good now I guess though I'm not too thrilled with her decision.

Edited in response to OP update:  YTA.  Considering the unwillingness to answer questions here, I'm going to guess there hasn't been a lot of discussion with your wife in which you were open to options.  Saying she does not have allergies does not preclude sensitivities, intolerances, or bad past experiences with food.  Both the obligation to adapt (reasonably) to guests as a measure of hospitality and the acceptability of taking food to an event vary by both culture and individual family in American culture.

AITA for reporting a coworker to HR and getting her transferred to another team?,"I(26F) am Muslim and Moroccan. But it isn't obviously Muslim I guess? (I don't wear Hijab)

First of all my first name is a name that is common in western countries too (think Sarah, Lina, Nadia, Miriam...), My last name, I came to know, is actually a Jewish name (I have a jewish ancestor) but it is very common in my country. So just by name you would think I am not Moroccan.

Then since I am Amazigh (Moroccan natives), I am very light skinned, with light hair and eyes. Not what you would think when you hear African.

I came to the US when I was 14 so I don't have an accent.

During the pandemic (specifically August 2020) I was hired by a company to work remotely 100% of the time. It was only on September 1st that I started going to the office.

I have a coworker, let's call her L. L and I have been sort of friends, we both belong to the same team, and even while working remotely we used to have friendly chats sometimes.

When we started working on site, she was so happy to have a friend to chat with. The first day she wanted to share her lunch. I declined because she wasn't able to tell me for sure if that pan she cooked the chicken in was used to cook pork before. So she said: ""so you follow Kosher the letter huh?"" And I replied: ""actually it's Halal for me"". She was obviously confused, then when she grasped the situation, she became cold on the spot.

I am sad to say this, but I am used to that reaction. In my mind all I heard was ""another one bites the dust"" and moved on with my life.

But she started acting very hostile towards me. For example if she sees that I am in hearing distance she would make blatantly Islamophobic comments, she follows me around the office, when other coworkers ask me out for a coffe with them she would loudly say she won't be coming with us ""because *she* is going""...etc. it was making me and everyone else very uncomfortable.

The last straw was Thursday, I was going for a coffe run (we take turns) and didn't want to take my bag with me (it was a big tote bag). Well she threw a fit, said that either I take my bag or she will call for security and ask them to go through it. When I said what she meant by that, she told me God knows what I have in it, my ""people"" are not exactly known for harmless bags. 

Everyone was shocked, they said that she went too far. I just went to HR directly and reported her. A couple coworkers did too. She was called in Friday, then I did too, and I said that I can no longer work in the same space as her.

Today I received an email that she will be transferred to another department. And I felt relieved. But my mom said that I know better than to do that, that I should have dealt with it without impacting her livelihood.

AITA For Shaving My Head Before My Cousin’s Wedding?,"My cousin, Delaney(24F), is getting married soon and I(13F) was asked to be the flower girl in her wedding. I know I’m a bit old for it, but I’m the youngest girl on that side of the family. Around a month after being asked to be the flower girl, I was diagnosed with Anaplastic Ependymoma Grade 3. I started chemotherapy, and my hair started falling out pretty quickly. I called Delaney and asked her what the hell I was supposed to do about my hair, and she told me that it’d be fine, and just to leave it alone for as long I could. We all knew my hair was probably not going last till the wedding day, and my brother ordered me a wig online. The wig looked a lot like my actual hair. My hair continued coming out in clumps and was getting extremely tangled and was just really uncomfortable. No one ever told me that losing my hair would be physically painful. Eventually, a couple days before the bridal shower and rehearsal dinner (they happened the same day), nearly half of my hair had come out, and I was so sick of the hot mess that my hair had become that I just cut all my hair off. The day of the rehearsal dinner, I wore my wig so that Braelyn, the family friend that Delaney had asked to be her hair stylist, could figure out how to style it. Delaney walked in as Braelyn was showing me how to use wig glue, and absolutely lost it. She asked me why I didn’t have hair and I told her ‘I have cancer, I lost my hair’ but she kept berating me and eventually I admitted that I had shaved my head because of how awful my hair looked.

AITA for only taking my nieces in and not their dad after my sister passed away?,"My F,33 sister F,36 passed away a month ago because of cancer. It's devastating and words can't express how we feel. Her husband struggled to pay off debts and has asked me and my husband to take him and my nieces age, 13 & 16 in for some time. I have to say that I'm not on good terms with him. We've had more than our fair share of disagreements in the past. He tried to sue me and my husband for my own mother's house which I'm living in with my husband and daughter. but he claimed he needed money to pay for my sister's treatment and, this was the only way to get it after we (my brother and I) refused yo help. It's a long story but we're not on good terms.

I agreed to only take my nieces in but not him. He tried to negotiate this saying his daughters are grieving and need him, their remaining parent to be around. I said he could see them during visits and that was it. My husband agreed with me at first. my brother inlaw showed up with my nieces days ago and I only let the girls in but turned him away after he tried to talk me into letting him stay. We had a huge argument and the girls went inside crying after their dad left repeatedly saying the want him. My husband is backing out of this saying we might be making a mistake seperating the girls from their dad when they're grieving. My aunt berated me saying I messed up entirely here. I argued that it's my home and I fon't feel comfortable with him staying after what he's done. She called me selfish and bitter and said I'm making it more difficult for the girls who just lost their mom. Now the girls are quiet but my 16yo niece keeps arguing about wanting her dad with them.

"AITA for asking my team member where she was when I noticed her ""away""/""offline"" status while she was WFH?","My team at work does 4 days WFO and 1 day WFH. This is because we have sensitive physical (paper) files to work with as part of our work, so we still have to come into the office. One of my team members, Sarah, had appealed to do 2 days WFO and 3 days WFH instead, on the basis that she has 2 kids to look after. Although other team members also have kids and Sarah had no problem coming in 5 days a week before the pandemic, I relented to the request after she became upset / accused me of being inflexible /started crying in my office. (And also checking with the rest of my team to make sure they were ok with it.)

I've noticed of late that when Sarah is WFH, she has a tendency to go ""offline"" or ""away"" on Skype during office hours. She is usually ""offline"" or ""away"" for more than an hour each time. Yesterday, I finally asked her about it, and told her that other people (internal clients and external stakeholders) have come to me for work matters she's handling because they could not locate her. One external stakeholder even told me that Sarah was on leave; when I clarified that Sarah was not on leave, the stakeholder was bewildered (""but she's been offline the whole morning"").

Sarah was defensive, and sarcastically apologised for ""not being there to reply to messages immediately"". She then added that as long as she got her work done, it didn't matter when she was online or offline. I told her she didn't have to be online for the entire 9 am to 6 pm duration, but minimally from 10 am to 5 pm (with a break for lunch), so that (a) people can reach her if they need to and (b) other team members don't notice and start following her example, particularly since Sarah is senior to the others.

Sarah was unhappy and since then I've come to be aware that she has been saying things about me to the rest of the team, including how I am a ""dinosaur"" still working according to former working norms. So, AITA?

EDIT: The entire division, including Sarah, reports to me. Sarah is salaried, not hourly. Sarah's work is affected by her behaviour because part of her job is being available to internal clients and where applicable, external stakeholders. External stakeholders can see whether Sarah is online or offline because we are all linked in a single public Skype network comprising related agencies, organisations, companies and Ministries. Separately, Sarah's conduct affects me and other team members, since we have to respond to queries meant for Sarah (particularly where they are urgent). It also reflects badly on the division as a whole when Sarah is unreachable.",16351,w053du,"I like to slack off when I can too, but I’m not gonna be surprised if I get called out for it.

My son (23) and his wife just had a baby boy, Everyone is overjoyed and excited but there have some issues that has risen recently.


When my DIL was pregnant, I suggested that I host a welcoming party for my grandson right after she get discharged from the hospital. I've made arrangements and even emptied a room for them to stay but for some reason, she was against it and said she'd rather spend the first few weeks at home with her newborn. not only that but she said no to the welcoming party. My husband and I talked to my son and he said ""we'll see"".


But just a couple a days ago, We found out that my daughter in law had given birth 2 weeks ago and no one knew about it. My nephew told me and I immediately called my son, he confirmed it. he and his wife lied then hid the date of birth from the family. I told him this was not acceptable, lying just because they didn't want a welcoming party and love and support being given from family. I told him I was disappointed because for one...he ruined our welcoming for our grandbaby and also, I invited family members and they're all rightfully disappointed as well. He said it was his last resort after I kept pushing and made his wife uncomfortable but that was not appreciated because.. we were just trying to celebrate the new family member in a proper manner. We had an argument and he ended the call upon saying I ruined his joy for his newborn. My husband started texting him since he stopped replying to our phonecalls and now is threatening to block my nephew for tattling but I think that my nephew was decent enough to inform the family. otherwise God knows how long my son and his wife were going to hide their son just to keep us at arms length. We've always been kind and welcoming to my daughter in law and ger family, I don't why she would do this and disrespect the family like that.

My f30, sister f39 has cancer. She's a single mom of her 16 year old son. We were asked to take him in while she gets treated so we could help him focus on studying and provide a normal routine for him.


My husband has asthma. He needs his inhaler throughout the day. Thing is, my nephew is a prankster. He'd hide the inhaler as a prank then give it back as soon as there's panic in the house. So far he's done it 2 times and thought it was just him ""messing around"".


The other day, My husband called me while I was at work panicing saying his inhaler was lost. I asked if my nephew had taken it as a prank,mbut he doubted it since my nephew would give it back instantly after we panic. I got home and we looked for it for hours and had to go to thd hospital eventually.


When we got back, We found it sitting at the coffee table. My husband and I looked at each other and next thing we knew. My nephew was giggling upstairs. In that moment, I just lost it. I yelled at him then told him he was no longer welcome in my home. He started panicking and my parents called me to get to the bottom of what happened, but still defended him saying it was a prank and that I took things too far by kicking him out while his mom is struggling.

I called him unreasonable because 2 egg? when it was the 4 of us? the kids wouldn't get enough. He yelled saying that I should keep in mind that he's the one who's expected to pay for all of that and will have to worry if we run out of groceries. I got upset and lost my appetite. I told him he could have the whole thing but he called me childish and immature for ""sulking"" when he was just being honest and straightforward with me.

I ended up having just coffee for breakfast and he left for work without speaking to me.

AITA for telling my wife that she doesn't need to be with her sick friend at the hospital?,"
So my wife has a friend from childhood named ""Anthony"". I'm being completely honest here when I say that he and I don't get along. It's not like he is rude or disrespectful (nothing like that) but all I feel towards him is ""annoyance"" sort of speak because of how much my wife sees him. He lives alone and now suffers from a medical condition (Cancer) that requires him to go to the hospital regularly to receive treatment. I found out that my wife promised him to go with him to his every chemo treatment as support. She said it's a commitment she made to be there for him during this rough time since he has no one else besides him.

Okay.....I had no issue with that at first but then this started affecting me. e.g, I can't go see my friends because I have to stay with my son on X day so my wife could be with Anthony for his treatment etc etc. I've talked to her about it but she said that Anthony needs company and that she's just being supportive and this is when he needs her the most.


I let it go but last week was just kind of my last straw. Anthony had a other chemo session treatment and my wife wanted to go with him and asked me to stay home with our son. I told her I had a meet up with my mom and sister to eat lunch and that I won't be home, She said she needed to go be with him and I kind of flipped out at her and said that she doesn't ""need"" to be with him and could literally go see him at home the next day or something. She threw a fit and called me cruel for forcing her to leave Anthony by himself since she's all he has and that I was making her look bad. She also said my appointment with mom and sister wasn't as important as a chemo session but I decided to just leave to end the argument.

She ended up staying at home but kept ignoring me when I got back calling me selfish for not letting her be there to support Anthony with what he's going through. Some of her girlfriends think I'm being a controlling jerk with no consideration for Anthony and what's he's going through.

AITA for threatening to tell my husband's sister and her husband about the tracking device he put in her car?,"
Very recently, I found out that my husband had installed a tracking device in his sister's car (he's a mechanic) while he was fixing it for her. I confronted him and he refused to tell me what was going on or expand on the situation. His sister and I are close. I threatened him to tell her and her husband but he lashed out saying that this has nothing to do with me and that I was out of line to get myself involved. He told me ""it's complicated"" that he can't say anything to me now and that I should keep my nose out of it. We had an argument and he started avoiding me saying there's gonna be an issue if I go through with my threat.



AITA for threatning to tell her? Should I back off?



More context: I was asked to put more context but I'm not sure what is and isn't relevent. But I found out about the tracking device when I heard him talking on the phone, he said his mom was on the phone and she knew about it but I doubt it because she's close to my SIL and also, when he was talking on the phone it didn't sound like he was talking to his mom. His tone was more formal than usual.",16252,z8t6ol,"NTA. 

It is a huge invasion of privacy for your husband to be tracking his sister's whereabouts without her knowledge. The fact that he won't share the reasoning with you is also a huge red flag. You'd be well within your rights to tell her. 

Another thing to consider is that if he's putting a tracking device on his sister, is he also doing the same to you? Secret cameras inside the home? It would be worth looking into.",271,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/z8t6ol/aita_for_threatening_to_tell_my_husbands_sister/
AITA for giving my MIL the wrong address so she could no longer send her granddaughter gifts?,"I [42m] have been married to my wife [39f] for 15 years. We have a wonderful 14-year-old daughter and an 8-year-old son. 

My wife's mother has some views that I don't agree with. Two years ago, for our daughter's 12th birthday, she sent her a book about crash dieting that promised something like 10 pounds of weight loss in three days. Our daughter was devastated because the underlying message was clear as day. It was a month until she started eating a whole plate of food for dinner again.

Our daughter is a healthy girl. She is highly active, studious, and most importantly, happy. Her grandmother believes that she's not reaching her ""full potential,"" whatever that means, and thinks that she'll be on the front covers of magazines if she can just shed some weight. Since she made these views clear to me, I have made it my mission to block any unsupervised contact, and this includes gifts.

About a month ago, with my daughter's upcoming 14th birthday, Grandma texted me asking for our new address. Normally she would ask my wife, but since she didn't answer within 10 minutes, she texted me instead. My wife would have given her our real address, but I was able to respond first with a fake one and tell my wife no response was necessary. I couldn't guarantee that I'd be home to intercept any gifts, and my daughter would open something addressed to her. It gave her some numbers/a street somewhere that I wasn't even sure existed. 

A couple of weeks later, after my daughter's birthday, I realized that it did not in fact exist as her package was returned to her. Both she and my wife were furious, and my wife amended the address I gave her before. Grandma insisted it was a completely innocent package. Well, the day it was scheduled for delivery, I decided to work from home. When it arrived I opened it up and found a baton twirling uniform (my daughter's hobby). Sound innocent enough? It was at least two sizes too small.

I sat my wife down with the stupid thing in front of us and said it was clearly intentional, which my wife refuses to acknowledge. Now she and her mother are even madder at me for throwing the uniform into the neighbor's garbage (with the neighbor's permission). 

Did I handle this correctly?",16236,xh1mlf,"So.  I applaud you standing up for and protecting your daughter. For that, you are NTA.  While people are quick to say you are, as you didn’t communicate with your wife… given that she refuses to see an issue with her mother doing this, i disagree with Reddit and you are NTA there, as well.  Bravo to you for prioritizing your daughter.  She needs someone in her corner, for sure.

That being said, I would make an appointment for couples counseling, and talk to the counselor specifically about this issue, how your wife doesn’t have concerns with it. You two do need to communicate, and get on the same page.  Your MiL needs to stop bullying and body shaming your daughter, who sounds like a normal, healthy child.  MIL can go pound sand.  I would go as far as to talk to your daughter - does she even want to see MiL?

AITA for a dry wedding and telling someone he has an alcohol problem?,"I (25F) am getting married. My fiancé(25 M) and I decided on a dry wedding since we do not drink and see no point in spending money for alcohol. We were debating about getting a cash bar but then decided to no alcohol at all. (There will be a wide range of other drinks, not just juice and soda, provided). 

We informed our guests via invitations with something along the lines of “You don’t have to be worried about choosing a driver or paying a taxi, since everybody will be able to drive”

So a friend (26M) called me and asked if I was joking about the dry wedding. I denied it. He asked two times more and I still denied joking. 
Then he asked what was wrong with me and how is supposed to have fun without alcohol and how he should function that night. And that it was not alright to chose a dry wedding. 

This is where I might have been the AH: 

I told him that I was not obligated to provide alcohol to him just because he is not able to have fun without it. And that, if he needs alcohol so badly and cannot function without it for even one night with people he knew, that he might be having an alcohol problem and should consider a therapy to treat it. 

He flipped out on me and I took his invitation back until he apologises because he used many slurs on me. 

Our friends are divided about me being the asshole. Some say I was right, other says I was not right.

So Reddit: AITA

Someone said to edit this in, so I do:

1. Cash bar - we debated about but decided against it, since we would have to pay a fee for them to open a cash bar and we don’t want to pay for alcohol. 

2. Events other then the wedding: we host dinners/party’s/events regularly for our friends and never provided alcohol. So to all people that know us, it is known that we were never ones to provide alcohol. The ones who wanted would bring a beer or two for themselves to a garden party but most of them just drank what we had available.

Edit 2: I am seriously shocked about the „I hate weddings so I drink at them“ comments. If you despise weddings why come to hammer yourself instead of staying away? No one forced you to come If you hate weddings so much.

Edit 3: 
1. I am still amazed how many people need alcohol for social gatherings and say “they need it to function and have fun because it’s boring without” - I still firmly believe that this is not healthy. 
2. thank you for the info that less people will come to the wedding, but don’t be afraid: 71 of 75 people are coming. A couple declined because their grandma has her 100 birthday that day. (Happy birthday in advance)
3. I see that Reddit is also decided if I am an AH or not, so I take that but thank you for most respectful conversations and discussions :)",16230,y3l3h9,"Emphatic NTA. I'm saying this as someone who would consider skipping a dry wedding depending on who was getting married.

He has every right to think it's boring. He has every right to not attend. He has zero right to demand answers to ""how am I supposed to have fun"" as if you're planning his birthday party. He has zero right to ask ""what's wrong with you"" for throwing a wedding based on what you want.

It's no different to destination weddings, potluck weddings, vegetarian weddings, childfree weddings, etc. Some people will think ""oh fuck that"" and that's fine, they just don't get to make demands of the couple getting married.",14018,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/y3l3h9/aita_for_a_dry_wedding_and_telling_someone_he_has/
AITA for telling him I'm locking myself in the room for the rest of the vacation because I'm tired of holding his sisters kid?,"My fiance and I were invited to go along on a trip to California for a week. I do not have my children with me due to them being with their father and having wrestling tournaments that they cannot miss (already spent hundreds on nonrefundable tickets for them to participate). 

We drove here with his family, so I was already quite exhausted when getting to the resort after having listened to an 8 month old scream practically the entire ride (23 hours but they INSISTED we go with them for the drive to swap off driving and site see). We were crammed in this vehicle like sardines because on the floor was their family dogs (a 75lb bull mastiff and her two puppies). So yes, dog shit was also present. They were quick to clean up but still. The car was putrid. 

When we get to the resort I quickly noticed how that I was seen as a built in babysitter for my fiance's sisters 8 month old daughter. Everytime my FSIL and her husband wanted to take a shower, swim, eat, or even if they just didnt feel like holding her, this child was thrown in to my lap basically. Every single time. There are 5 other adults here but they claimed that this child only wanted me. I cant exactly argue it because at this point I had held the baby so much that she did put her arms out for me quite often, even in passing in the hallway. But it hit a point where I was getting pissed. I was in the pool yesterday and my FSIL gets in and within 5 minutes passes the baby off to me. I hand her back maybe 10 minutes later claiming I needed to use the restroom and stayed indoors. Maybe 15 minutes later they come inside and pass the baby off to me again saying they need to shower and ask me to bring the child in to them in 10 minutes. After I pass the baby off to them, I lock myself in the room and I've barely left since.

My fiance comes in here a bit ago and tells me we are all going out to eat and I told him I didnt feel like going and becoming a highchair to the baby while her parents ate. As it is, I've already held this child more than enough and had several drinks spilled on me because of her octopus arms. He said I cant just sit up here to avoid holding the baby and that I am wasting the trip all because I wont say no. Half the time they dont ask though. The baby is practically tossed at me.

AITA for refusing to pay my husband for using a room in the house for my WFH job?,"I (F32) began working from home 2 months ago. My husband bought the house we live in before we got together. He calls it his property which's fine by me. The house is small, has only 2 rooms , one of which used to be empty til I started using it as an office for my wfh job.


All was going fine with my job til he sat me down last night saying he's expecting 30% ""profit"" from whatever I get from my job since he ""provides"" the office for my work. I was completely caught off guard by this. I asked if he was serious and he went on about it being his home and how he could be using this room for his own purpose since it's ""his property"". I said no and called him unreasonable which led to a blowup. I yelled at him saying he won't get a penny and he pitched a fit and accused me of ""taking full advantage"" even though there's no mortgage to be paid. I do all chores in the house as well as share pay the bills in half.

He got his family involved in this and they're split. His mom thinks I'm being difficult and that 30% is not a huge amout and that this room is providing ""stability"" for my wfh and so my husband should get some sort of benefits.

AITA for insisting on attending my sister's wedding?,"

I f32 been dating John m37 for 2 years. He's a single dad to 3 kids [4m (jr) ,6m,9m]. I moved in with him and his kids a little while ago. I gave to say that he's super protective of his kids, I haven't been able to meet them til later because he said they might not like me and so he started easing them into accepting me by encouraging me and pushing me to be ""extra friendly"" to them by buying them stuff and cooking for them daily.

He's very busy often times, and the boys have now clinged on to me because they see me more than they see him. Don't get me wrong; I'm grateful for this outcome but the issue is that I can't be away from them for a long time. More than hours. Now that I'd moved in I can't go anywhere without taking them with me. I can barely have time for myself but what's worse is that my work got interrupted by that. John suggested I work less hours but it didn't happen.


Now my sister is getting married soon. It'll be held hours away so I'll have to travel. The invitation stated ""child-free"" so I can't take the kids. When John heard about this he told me to immediately call and apologize cause I won't be attending. I was stunned I asked why and he went on about how much the kids adore me and how they'll go crazy when I'm hours away from them. besides, that he's too busy to look after them. I said it's not my fault and he should either take time off work and stay with them or get a babysitter. He threw a fit about how selfish and unfeeling I was and that he will only let me attend the wedding when I tell my sister to let the kids come but I can't ask such thing of her! I INSISTED on going after he kept saying I shouldn't go. He went and told the boys that I was looking for an excuse to get some time away from then and now they won't even speak to me. I confronted him about what he did and he said it's the result of me ""insisting"" on going to the wedding and choosing my sister over my stepkids. He even said I should be thankful the kids ""accept"" me for who I am and are giving me this much attention. I was speechless and felt offended.


AITA for standing my ground and wanting to go? She's my only sister and we have a great relationship so not attending her wedding can cause issues.

EDITING SOME INFORMATION: to answer the question about the biological mom. His eldest is from his late wife. He then dated his ex girlfriend and had his middle and youngest child with her. Now she's out of the picture. The eldest user to be kind of distant from his half brothers and had issues with them for years. I was left to navigate through that and help him re-bond with them.

John was clearly too busy to try to fix this problem a long time ago.",16176,w9cu4g,"Wow.

AITA. Daughter dyed her hair badly and refuses to go to school,"Can't believe this is happening but here we go.

Daughter (14) has always been naturally blond, however the last few months brown hair has been coming through her roots. She has asked us if she can dye it earlierbthis month. We said yes, but only if its done professionally - an appointment is booked for 8th February, very popular salon with good reputation, meaning long wait times but if its being done its being done right. Reason for this is both her, her sister and my wife have very sensitive scalps, last time older daughter used an at home kit it went badly wrong... doctors kind of wrong.

Youngest daughter was happy with this and agreed to wait, but this weekend went out with her friend and bought an at home kit, dying her hair at her friend's house without any adult assistance.

Well, now it's orange.

We offered to buy a brown or black kit to cover it until her appointment, but she screamed she is a blonde, not brunette and hasn't really left her room since.

She is refusing to go to school until WE 'fix it'. I said I don't have a magic hair fixing spell, and the choice is go dark for 3 weeks or put up with the orange colour, we phoned the salon but they cannot move up the appointment, but will contact in case of a cancellation.

So reddit AITA for sending my daughter to school with self inflicted orange hair?

Edit. To be clear as its been mentioned a few times, the brown/brunette option was a temporary colour, not a permanent, it'd wash out in a few weeks anyway.

Edit 2: we have tried at other salons aswell, however they have similar wait times. One can fitnusnin earlier (25th jan) but honestly their Google reviews are a very mixed bag- 2 stars out of 5 so we're not overly confident with that one.

Edit 3: thanks for all the responses with advice. We won't be dying it again and will try the purple/blue shampoo instead hoping to tone it down. 

Also wife just got off the phone with a salon who can get her in this Friday so she'll have to suck it up for the rest of the week! It's going to costbus nearly twice as much as the normal salon, so guess who will be doing extra chores for a while...

Final edit: wife sourced silver shampoo so will be doing this shortly. Daughter emerged from her room. Apologising to us for the tantrum which we accepted and apologising for ruining her hair. We laughed, and said its her hair, not ours so she should apologise to herself, so she grabbed a mirror, stroked her hair and said a heartfelt sorry. So all seems to be right in the world again.",16199,10dc5ii,"NTA.  You made her the appointment.  Her impatience caused her situation.  This is a good learning experience for her: accountability.  If you make a mistake it’s on you to fix it, no one else.  Also, reinforce the medical condition issue your other daughter faced.

AITA for sending my cousin the bill for my kid's birthday cake because her kid ruined it?,"We recently threw my 5 year-old a birthday party. He hasn’t had a real birthday party since he was 2 years old due to Covid, so this was the first one he’d actually remember. We wanted to make it special so we invited all our closest friends, family members and their kids.

One of my cousins, a single mom, has a very unruly 6 year-old. He is loud, disobedient, and a nightmare in public. When it came time to blow out the candles and cut the birthday cake, he came and stood directly next to my son. I anticipated what was going to happen next and asked my husband to stand behind this kid in case he tried to pull anything.

After we sang, this kid kept trying to blow out the candles. My husband kept blocking him and pulling him back and we could tell the kid was getting frustrated. Eventually my son blew out the candles and the kid absolutely lost it. He threw a tantrum and slammed his entire arm into the cake, knocking it into the table. It was so awkward, everyone gasped and got quiet. My son looked up at us and I could tell he was about to start crying. In an effort to not cause a bigger scene, my husband picked him up and whispered to him that we had another special cake just for him (we didn’t) and he seemed to calm down.

Meanwhile, his cousin was still standing there screaming and crying, his arm covered in cake. His mom was nowhere to be seen. I walked him over to the sink and washed him off and quietly told him that he shouldn’t have done that to the cake and that he should apologize to his cousin for what he did. He screamed “NO!” in my face and then ran away.

My husband ended up running out to buy a sheet cake that we cut and served to everyone. I spoke to my cousin after the party about what happened since she wasn’t in the room, and she brushed it off saying “kids will be kids”. I completely disagree. I’ve been to plenty of birthday parties where the other kids let the birthday boy/girl have their moment. I suggested she pay for the ruined cake and she looked at me like I was crazy.

I told her how important it was to us that this birthday be special to my son since it would be the first one he remembered, and now all he would remember was that his cousin ruined his special moment. She got extremely defensive and refused to pay for anything. She then accused me of acting like “the perfect mom” and began to list the ways in which I was in fact NOT perfect. It was a hurtful conversation and we haven’t spoken since.

I sent her the bill for the ruined cake and she has not paid us. I actually feel she should pay for both cakes since her kid is the reason we had to get a new one, but I didn’t go that far. My husband thinks she’ll never pay us and that I should drop the issue at this point. He says that since she’s a single mom it’s probably hard on her and we should cut them both some slack. I understand that, but I feel like that’s just letting her and her son off the hook and this will lead to even bigger problems in the future if we don’t hold them accountable.

AITA for not paying for my neices college tuition.,"I (45M) am a father of 3 (25M) , (21M) and (18F) but I also take care of my niece (17F) after her father passed away. 

My wife (45F) and I have always treated her like family and we give her things equally to the others so that she doesn't feel left out. 

I honestly really care about her but financially I can't support her all my life. When my eldest moved away I had more money to spare so I was able to get her more things.

My daughter is now going away to college so my neice was excited and came to my wife and I about colleges she liked.


I told her it was great she was thinking of college and I said it would be good for to apply for scholarships now so it would be easier later. She laughed and asked why when her tuition would be payed for.

I told her that no I wouldn't, I only had money to pay for my kids but I would help her out with basic necessities. She was silent after that then went to her room. Apparently she spoke to my father because he called me in a rage and said I was being cruel to her especially since my brother was always close to me when he was alive.  I told him I just didn't have that type of money saved and he said if I had cared for her I would've started saving as soon as I took her in.

My brother died very young so he didn't have much saved and my niece's mother's side isn't offering anything. I admit I could've told her earlier that I wouldn't pay for her tuition but I didn't. AITA?

AITA for refusing to apologize to my mother in-law after she saw me wearing underwear?,"


This happened yesterday morning at 9 in the morning, I f33 was in the kitchen eating breakfast wearing my regular underware. Suddenly I heard gasping sounds coming towards me, I turned and saw mother and sister in law yelling about what I was wearing. I was in utter shock and just froze in my seat. My husband was asleep at the time and he must've heard his mom and sister scream because he ran downstairs asking what's going. his mom started ranting loudly about what an appropriate scene she and her daughter saw. I'm still sitting in shock when my husband started yelling at me to go put something on quickly. I went upstairs while his mom kept yelling after me calling me shameless and inappropriate I then heard my husband say it won't happen again. I was so mad, I put a coat on and went downstairs and started arguing with my mother in law. I told her she shouldn't have come over without notice but turns out my husband told her to come over at 9 to discuss a family crisis. My mother in law said I was in the wrong for walking around half naked knowing she has a key and might show up any minute. I told her it's my home and she said it's her son's home too. we argued and my husband told me to knock it off and apologize but I refused and went bavk upstairs. then after his mom and sister left he called me childish and inappropriate. I tried to explain my side but he said what's done's done and he promised his mom that I will apologize but I said I will never apologize and she's gonna have to wait for decades for that. He got upset and called me disreslectful towards my guests. and mother in-law was technically a guest so...

he's still nagging me for an apology to his mom via email to get this over with. AITA for not apologizing? I'll apologize if it turns out that I'm TA here.

* First and formost, I'm not american (I wish lol) you guys probably figured this out by my horrific grammar lol but I did my best.

* Mother in-law has a copy of the key, After what happened I told my husband to tell his mom to give the key back but he said no and that he won't punish her for something I DID.

* Yes, he tends to take her side more often. She's super conservative and does not like me very much.


* Oh and one more thing. this ""country"" I live in (not my country originally) treats women as ""possessions"" e.g instead of calling me by my name they would say ""Eric's wife"" or ""his woman"" which is rude and offensive. another e.g is that there are lots of places women can not access and seeing a woman drive can be seen as an unusual thing for them. the reason I married my husband was that he was different from them.

AITA for kicking my sister out from every streaming platform I own because she kicked my dad from her netflix?,"English is not my first language, this is NOT the us. The streaming devices prices are really up here.

I'll try to keep it short, my (25M) mom passed away four years ago and one of the things my dad(65M) clanged ever since was movies, they really enjoyed doing it together so I guess he took comfort on keeping the activity on his own. At that time my sister(32F) got a two screen Netflix subscription and gave one to my dad so he could use it whenever she wanted.

During those four years I was able to get pretty much all of the rest and since my sister was paying for my dad's netflix I thought I gave one of the screens to use. So no biggie.

I've been out of town ever since New Years Eve and I finally came back home a week ago. I told my dad that we should see a movie together in netflix or sum but he said that netflix ''wasn't working''. I found it odd so I asked what he meant while taking his phone, he said that he asked my sister a few months ago but she said that '' it wasn't working'' so ''they'd to wait for it to work''. I only hummed and tried to log in again but it didn't let me so I called my sister asking for the password, she said she couldn't share the account anymore because now that they had my nephew (2M) they were using one of the screens for him and another for her husband. This enraged me, I asked her why she didn't told me before and why she lied to my dad, she said she didn't had the heart to tell him and I told ''but you have the heart to lie to him, don't you?'' and hang up.

Since then I've gotten my dad a new netflix account and I've changed all of my passwords so only my dad and I have them, two days ago she called saying that my BIL wanted to watch GOT but the account kicked him out and I told her ''yeah, it was me'', she flipped and asked for the password because they can't afford it on their own and I said ''well I didn't had the heart to tell you'' and I hang up the phone again. My BIL texted me calling me petty and an AH, my dad's oblivious to all of this. My sister called again and asked for the password of one of the platforms (you know, the children-friendly one) because my nephew wants to see Encanto and I said she has to apologize to my dad first, at least, and she said my nephews discomfort is on me.",16103,tiz8au,">she has to apologize to my dad first, at least, and she said my nephews discomfort is on me.

This indicates that she has no intention of coming clean and apolozing. She also let your dad experience the same discomfort for months and instead of owning it, she lied. Im sure if she were honest with him, he would have no problem letting his grandson have the access instead of him, and he or you would've been able to get him his own account rather than going months without anything.

AITA for not wanting my husband to go see Batman when our baby is due?,"My (25F) husband (28M) and I are expecting a baby. As you may know, there is a new Batman movie releasing on early march. My husband is a big fan of that kind of stuff and wants to see it opening day. The issue is that our estimated due date is exactly on that day. I know that only a fraction of babies are actually born on the exact due day but I have always been very regular on my periods and I have a feeling that I may be one of those cases.

He says it is important to see the movie the first day because of spoilers and that, even I end up having the baby that day while he is watching the movie, at worst he would arrived a few hours late and is not such a big deal.

AITA for calling my stepchildren my kids and upsetting my wife?,"I married my wife last year (after four years of dating), and we mixed our families: her two boys, Dylan and Tyler (16 and 11 now) and my girl Sam (18 now). Our children accommodated to the idea of living together pretty well. 

Dylan and Ty's father and my wife got divorced when Tyler was born, and they agreed he would only have visitation rights.

Around two or three years ago Tyler called me dad while we were having dinner, and that night my wife asked me to correct her children when they call me dad, out of respect for their actual father. I found it weird but I agreed to cause in the end they're her children, although I never ended up doing it.

This week Dylan had a football match and Tyler a piano lesson, which my wife usually picks them up after. This time both she and I didn't have to work, so I suggested picking them up together. Dylan practically jumped to our car and then we all went to pick up Tyler, and since I was there I decided to meet his piano teacher too.

When she met my wife, Dylan and me she greeted us and asked me if I was the kids' dad. I sincerely forgot about that promise I made years ago, and said I indeed was their father. My wife almost instantly corrected me with ""stepfather"" and then Dylan said out loud ""Mom!""

The return home was awkward, and when we arrived she called me out for breaking the promise we had by saying I'm the kids' dad. To make it worse this morning I noticed the kids are acting distant towards their mother and they deliberately are calling me dad whenever she's around. I feel guilty cause it's the first time there has been such tension between them and it's my fault.

AITA for calling them my kids?

Update: Thank you all for all the comments, I couldn't read them all but I still appreciate them. 

A few hours ago while we all were having lunch I decided to bring the topic and asked my wife why is she so against the kids calling me dad if that's something they want to do. She said that she was afraid me calling myself dad in public would make the kids believe they were forced to view me as their dad too. Dylan told her that was ridiculous, and I agree but I didn't said it cause I thought that would create conflict.

I asked Sam and Dylan to take Tyler to his room and then I opened up about how I feel about her interactions with her ex. I know I shouldn't have because he's the kids father and all that stuff but I still told her I thought the guy was a trash parent and that she was giving a bad example to the kids by interacting with him so much. She said she wants to keep a good relationship with the dude in case the kids want him in their lives and I told her she just was hurting the kids and that she should focus on spending time with them instead, since as their mother she should know how they feel after so many years.

Finally, I told her I won't do anything about Dylan and Tyler calling me dad. I'm happy they do so and if she wants them to stop, for whatever ridiculous reason she may have, then she'll have to ask the kids herself, and If she can't, then that means she must realize what a shitty request that is.

I admit that I got a little heated up and used harsher words that I would've liked to use now, but I'm still glad I could finally tell her all of this. I'll start being more direct towards her from now on.

I didn't touch the adoption subject because I thought it was too much at once. Later on I'll bring it up and update you on what happened since you all supported the idea.

AITA for refusing to pay for her hotel room??,"I rent out the spare bedroom in my house for $800 a month (market rate in my area). I don't know my roommate very well, but we work for the same company. I work early mornings and she works late evenings. So we're often ships passing in the night.

On Friday my hot water heater broke. The home warranty guys said they couldn't get anyone out until Monday morning. It's hot as balls right now, so I wasn't too upset. A few cold showers won't kill anyone. I texted my tenant ""hot water is out until Monday"" and she responded 👍.

I didn't see her all weekend, which is normal, as I said. The guy got here at 8AM to fix the heater. When he was done I texted her to let her know the hot water was back on. She hits me with this gem. ""My hotel bill was $250. Do you want to reimburse me now or deduct it from next month's rent?""

I stared at the text for a good while. I didn't even know she was gone. She got a hotel room just for hot water? That's so extra. She could have showered at work, but she got a hotel room? I texted ""hey, I didn't know you left. Rent is still due in full on the first of the month, regardless of if you choose to sleep elsewhere for a weekend.""

She texted me back ""there was no water. I couldn't stay there. You're my landlord and have to provide me with livable accomodations.""

I texted back ""there was water, just not hot. If it was winter, you might have a point. Rent is still due in full. Failure to pay rent will result in me filing with the court, which will impact your credit.""

She stopped responding. I texted a friend who said I was way too harsh and should have just countered with a $50 discount for those two days or something. Which, sure, if she'd asked for a $50 reduction that would have been reasonable. But I'm not paying for her hotel and the audacity of her to ask me pisses me off.

AITA for cancelling my credit card after my boyfriend refused to return it to me?,"
I'll preface by saying that Me (27) and my boyfriend (30) have been together for 3 years an a half. I've been jumping from one job to another while he has been unemployed due to health issues that affected his performance at work.


Usually, I'm the one handling rent, bills, groceries etc. I use my credit card to make any purchase I want.


Last week, My boyfriend out of nowhere asked for my credit card. I asked why since I'm the one who handles payments and supermarket trips. He told me he wanted to buy some food and I agreed to let him take it but told him to return it later. 


He got back later and when I asked about my credit card, he was like ""what credit card?"". I thought he was joking so I told him to just give it back. He said he'd just keep it with him. I asked why and he said so he could start handling paying for stuff on my behalf. I felt uncomfortable I said I'd rather not burden him with this stuff and asked him to hand over the credit card. He refused and said that ""he'll just keep it"" since it doesn't have that much money anyway. I was livid. I tried to argue but he told me to ""just trust him"" and let him keep it and swore he won't spend a penny from it.

Next morning I went and cancelled it, then registered a new one. He must've had tried to use it because he called and was confused asking why the credit card was not valid anymore. I told him it's because I cancelled it and registered a new one. He lost it and started scolding me saying he couldn't believe I had this level of petty and kept on about how I don't trust him with my finances. and how financially abusive I have become lately. I hung up on him.


The argument continued at home and he called me paranoid and unreasonable and all that. Then he started cold shouldering me and sulking about it for days. I do feel like I hurt his feelings and showed an amount of distrust towards him.


AITA for canelling the credit card?

EDIT / Adding in some info.

* Like I said he has a physical disability that limits his opportunities for work. He receives no disability benefits because he doesn't want to. He refuses to acknowledge he has a disability and pretends that it doesn't exist at all.

* When I tell him to look for a job, he'd blame people for purposely refusing to employ him and say that they look down on him like he's lacking or beneaath them.

* He comes from a humble background. no longer has contact with family due abandonment issues but has some friends to lean on..

* Since someone asked, the answer is I do almost 80% of chores while he does the other 20%. reasons for that is his disability.

* Finally, I pay for rent, bills, groceries, his meds and transportation as well so I needed the card to he constantly with me.",16037,xfxnz3,Also beware.

AITA for telling the parents of the neighborhood the real reason why their kids can no longer play in my yard/playground?,"My grandparents owned the lot next to their house, they just used it for more yard space. But  when my sister and I were born grandpa knocked down the old shed on the empty lot and built a playground for us. Everything was made with his own two hands. It was a kid's dream and we both played there any chance we got. And after we grew up they let the kids of their neighborhood use the place to play with no issues. But then some years later they passed and the house went to my mom.

I found out I'm expecting so my husband ""Andre"" and I started seriously looking for a house when we'd only been half trying before. Mom suggested we buy my grandparent's house since we know it's a good place and us buying it would keep it in the family. It's still in good shape, has no HOA, and is close to a good school. So we bought it for a steal and moved in asap. Right away we noticed parents hanging out at the playground with their kids. We didn't mind at first and used the chance to introduce ourselves. Everyone was lovely and younger than I'd expected but it seems a bunch of couples with kids had taken over the street in the past 5 or so years.

The problem arose when Neighbor Witch (NW) brought her kid over one afternoon. I happened to be by the window and saw a flash of red outside. It was a kid in a red shirt literally standing on the ROOF of one of the 2 story playhouses, almost 10 feet off the ground. I ran outside, thinking he was alone and said he needed to get down right now. That's when NW stormed over from who knows where and yelled at me to fuck off and not tell her kid shit. I asked if she was his mom and after getting a yes I asked her to make her son get down before he got hurt. She argued saying I couldn't make them do anything, so I told her this was my property and yes I could.

That's when the kid fell, thankfully once he was halfway down and only onto the grass but he still wailed like he was dying. He was fine. He got up without issue and ran over to NW. She picked him up and said if he'd been hurt she'd have sued me so I threatened her with the cops if she didn't leave. She flipped me off and called me a ""gin jockey"" (random af, I don't drink at all, let alone gin) but left. Andre was worried other people might try to sue us if their kids got hurt on our land (I hadn't even thought of that) so we put up a fence. Parents came by asking why the fence so I told them why, and they can thank NW. I heard she's been shunned by the other parents and none of them will let their kids play with hers.

I feel guilty her son is getting punished for her actions. Maybe just saying we wanted a fence up instead of telling them about NW would have been kinder?

AITA for walking out in the middle of my husband's birthday dinner,"My husband (30M) and I (27F) have been together for 3 years and married for 5 months. Our relationship has been without any problems until the week before our wedding. My husband was very close friends with a woman (Let’s call her Ava) that he has known since they were sophomores in high school. 

I never had a problem with Ava, I thought it was very obvious that she and my husband are just friends, I mean she had a long-term boyfriend and all. So, I felt no jealousy or anything. I actually got along with Ava pretty well. We all hung out together regularly. But then my husband dropped a bombshell on me the week before we got married. I remember he sat me down and told me that Ava revealed to him that she has feelings for him and tried to convince him to not get married to me. She even broke up with her boyfriend (of 6!! Years) to prove that she was serious about my husband.

My husband and I both agreed to cut her off, we uninvited her to our wedding and neither one of us have been in contact with her since. 

It was my husband’s 30th birthday yesterday, he just wanted to have a dinner with family and friends so that’s what we did. So, we are all in a restaurant eating when all of a sudden Ava walks in. She walks to our table and says she didn’t mean to intrude, that she was just getting dinner by herself and then saw us. She then wishes my husband a happy birthday. I expect her to leave but then my husband asks if she wants to join us. I look at my husband like what the fuck are you doing. I’m visibly uncomfortable and irritated. I stand up and tell Ava that she can have my seat and then I walk out and get an uber home because I want absolutely nothing to do with her. 

When my husband comes home almost two hours later, he immediately starts an argument with me. He tells me I overreacted and acted immaturely. I ask him why did he ask Ava to eat with us because I thought we were on the same page. He replies that was just being nice and he didn’t think it would be a big deal because it’s been a long time since he has seen her so she probably doesn’t have feelings for him anymore. And then he tells me that I ruined his birthday.

AITA for getting upset with my best friend's son for giving my son cake?,"My son is 8 years old and recently attended his friend's 8th birthday party. This friend is my best friend's son. I don't let my son have any/much junk food at all and usually he brings his own snacks (for this incident it was carrot sticks and ranch) to events that have a lot of sugary foods.

My best friend bakes a lot, and made a special chocolate cake for her son's birthday. When it comes to my son, I don't let him have cake. This is personal preference for his health, not for any allergy reasons, and he is not diabetic or gluten free. My son knows he isn't allowed to have cake because of the additives. When he told his best friend this at the party, his friend apparently got upset and told him it was ""good cake"", not bad like I say, because his mom made it, and it was his birthday cake. My son ate cake, got a sugar rush, and crashed, making him cranky for the rest of the day after we left the party. 

I told my friend she needs to have some kind of consequences for her son to teach him not to peer pressure other children into eating things they're not allowed to have. She said because it wasn't an issue of allergies or health, that she's sorry my son was cranky but she won't be punishing her son or talking to him about it on his birthday. She says also that she'll just that she'll watch more closely/make sure her husband does in the future, as well as have a chat with him on another day about respecting food habits. (I love my friend, but historically, her and her husband have always said 'yes' to their son and not given him any consequences for anything.)

Both of us were present at the party and did not see them sharing the cake (they were outside eating in the backyard with their fathers and some other parents supervising while we cleaned up) so it's not an issue of anyone going behind anyone's back, just teaching children boundaries and respect. 

I let my son stay for the rest of the party and be with his friend, so it's not like I ruined the day.

AITA for not eating my meal at my cousins wedding because my dad changed my selection,"Several years ago my grandparents had a 50th anniversary party.  It was set up kinda like a wedding reception so we had a choice for the meal, the options were 2 different German foods and steak. I was like 16 so I chose steak. 

Then at the actual event someone couldn't come and orders were mixed up and I ended up with a pickle wrapped in meat.  Everyone insisted that was what I picked. So I tried it, but then gave it to my dad because I didn't like it.  Later they realized that I ended up with the person that couldn't comes food.  No big deal. 

Well since then this has become a joke with my family.   They've done it 2-3 times since, whenever there's a wedding/event with food selections. When my grandma was alive she yelled at my dad for it since he's the instigator.  I'm not sure if he's doing it to get 2 meals or to be annoying,  make me mad or what the deal is. 


My cousin got married Saturday, a few weeks ago they sent out cards to pick our meal. They sent all of ours (Dad's,  mine, sisters) to my dad's house, with one return envelope.  The options were steak, chicken,  or stuffed portobello mushrooms.  I selected steak, and specifically told my dad to ""just let me have a damn steak instead of messing with it"". He said ""I won't write anything on your card"". 

Then fast forward to Saturday,  everything is going well, wedding is nice. We sit down to dinner and they give me  mushroom stuffed with vegetarian pilaf.  I said ""there must be a mistake I selected the beef"". Server said that the star on my place card meant I ordered vegetarian.  

I looked at my dad and he laughed and said ""I called Natalie after we sent our cards and told her you became a vegetarian and wanted to change your choice"". My sister was there and said ""dad don't you think that's getting old"". I said ""you said you wouldn't mess with it"" he said ""No I said I wouldn't write on your card, I didn't.  I called her, now you have to eat mushrooms ha ha "".  I said ""no I don't"". Some time passed and my dad said ""seriously you're not even going to try it? They'rejust mushrooms they won't hurt you"" I shook my head. I hate mushrooms and I'm sick of this joke. 

I sat there til other people started getting up, then I got up and went by the bar and had a beer, and avoided my dad til I left. 

My sister later said that I should have at least tried a little,  it was kinda rude to just leave a whole plate of food sitting there. She said I could have had some of the rice stuff, but for all I know there were mushrooms in the pilaf too. 

Honestly this makes me not want to go to anymore family events with a meal.

AITA for not allowing my daughter's half sister to spend christmas with us?,"



My ex husband and I got divorced 7 years ago. We share custody of our 13 year old daughter. He got married and has a 5 year old daughter with his now wife.


His daughter would spend time with my daughter regularly. They adore each other but she doesn't come to my house and they rarely meet up there.


His wife has been diagnosed with cancer and has started treatment recently. The other day he came to drop our daughter off and asked to speak to me. He talked about his wife's circumstances then how his family won't be able to have a christmas celebration this year. He said it wasn't fair for his daughter and asked if I could ""include"" her in my family's celebration. He pointed out how the girls will have a great time together bonding and making memories, but I said I was sorry but my family's traditional celebration is a sacred thing and I do not feel comfortable including anyone else. Plus it'd be awkward having her in my home. He said that his daughter may not be family to me but she sure is to her halfsister. He asked me to stop and ""think"" about what's best for the kids here. I suggested he take his daughter to spend christmas with her grandparents (he said his parents and him are NC) and tried to cut the conversation short but he stopped me and started going on about how cruel it was for me to decline to include his daughter who's already having a hard time adjusting. I saw that he was beginning to cry so I stepped back and said I was no longer feeling comfortable having this conversation. I asked him to leave and he did but still texted me asking me to agree to let his daughter come spend christmas even offered that he stays away if that'll make me less uncomfortable, I said no and now he's calling me selfish and unfeeling.

AITA for telling my SIL that no one in our family is named Stephanie?,"I can't figure out if I did anything wrong, or if so, what, because I honestly have no idea what's going on. Hopefully someone here can give me a clue. Here's the relevant info, as far as I know.

My brother and his wife are expecting their first girl after two boys. I love Ricky and Jace, and so does my SIL, but she has always wanted a girl and is very excited to be having one. She also wants to name the girl Chloe, as she loves that name. My brother hates the name Chloe and really wants to name their daughter Stephanie. They have been arguing about it for a few weeks, since finding out the gender.

I got to my parents house late last night and my SIL was the only person still awake. We talked for a little bit, and she asked me the weirdest question. She asked me if I knew any stories about great aunt Stephanie. I was so confused. I literally said ""who?""

SIL clarified that she was talking about our grandmother's older sister that died when grandma was a little girl. Our grandma had two sisters, but their names were Judy and Lynn. There's no one in our family named Stephanie, as far as I know. I told as much to my SIL. She changed the subject after that, and we soon went to bed.

This morning my brother and his wife were both sulking during breakfast. Even the kids could tell. Ricky kept saying ""stop being grumpy on Christmas."" So it wasn't just my imagination. I got my brother alone and confronted him. He snapped at me for ""meddling"" and told me to stay out of his marriage.

My brother is pissed at me, and my SIL won't even talk to me. I'm afraid to say anything to my parents and drag them into this, especially since I still don't know what this is. Either my grandmother had a secret sister that I don't know about but my brother does for some reason, or my brother lied to his wife to convince her to name their baby Stephanie. Both options seem equally weird to me. Maybe there's a third possibility I'm not seeing?

Reddit, am I the asshole? If so, please explain to me why. I don't want to be the reason Christmas is ruined.

Update: Most awkward Christmas Eve dinner ever. Gotta keep this short; lots going on. Everyone now knows what my brother was doing with the kids names(except the kids obviously). They are pissed. Weirdly my mom is the most pissed. A Christmas truce is in place for the kids, so no fighting on the holiday. However the baby is definitely going to be named Chloe. My brother very quickly backed down when my mom said some few choice words to him. The topic is completely banned for the rest of festivities, so, for now at least, they've tied a bow on the situation.

Christmas morning update: Aside from some glaring over a couple of the boy's stocking stuffers (Robin Funko pops) everything went well with the gift opening (as well as being woken up at 5:30 AM by being jumped on by one's nephews can). I think my brother realizes he crossed a line and has been very attentive to his wife. He mentioned getting Chloe's name embroidered on some stuff when they get home.

AITA for laughing at my neighbor and calling them stupid before closing the door on them?,"I 25M live in my family’s cottage which I was given ownership of. The cottage itself is a waterfront property facing a medium-sized lake. My family has been living here for generations as my great grandfather originally bought it before passing it down eventually leading to me. My neighbors are a different story as many of the people I have known since childhood has moved out. The houses that my neighbors once had have been torn down and replaced with “designer” style homes. With the construction of these homes came new neighbors and an HOA of which I am not a member.

&#x200B;

My problems started with my next-door neighbor Sophie(F50-60?) over fishing. One day after doing some Canoe fishing I was approached by Sophie on my beach. She started asking if it was legal to fish on the lake to which I said it was as long as you pay the 25$ per year license. After that, I said that I had to go as I had caught some fish and I wanted to start processing them for dinner as it was getting lake. After our conversation, I did not hear from her for over two weeks. My encounter with her this time was not in person but through a letter. In this letter, she wrote about how “dangerous” fishing is to the environment and why I should stop. In response, I chose to simply chuck it in my recycling bin and ignore her as it wasn’t worth my time.

&#x200B;

My most recent encounter was two days ago while I had some friends over. It was in the afternoon when I had ran back into the house for some more beers along with one of my friends. While grabbing the drinks we heard a knock at the door. When I answered the door it was Sophie and she had another letter.  Before handing the letter she said that she had tried to be diplomatic and now she has had enough and has a letter from the HOA. Admittedly I was a bit tipsy at the time and in response, I laughed and called her stupid for believing the HOA can do anything before closing the door on her. 

&#x200B;

After sobering up I feel conflicted, on one hand I feel that I was justified in my actions because my fishing is none of her business. On the other hand I feel that I could have dealt with her in a more tactful way.

AITA for telling my BIL that if I have to breastfeed inside then he has to go and be insufferable somewhere else?,"My (25F) husband (28M) and I just had our first baby four months ago, we're just recently visiting family and letting more people outside our parents meet our child. My FIL birthday was yesterday and they throw him a small party, so my husband and I decided to join and took our baby with us. 

It's important to add that my BIL(27M) (my husband's sister(30F)husband) doesn't like me that much because of the way I drees, express myself and talk (I say a lot of bad words). His favorite thing to say it's ''If you were my woman\_\_\_'' followed by something really stupid. My husband thinks that he might have a thing for me, but I don't care and neither does he tbh, he finds it funny.

They have two kids tho, a 7M and a 4M. 4M is a sweet boy, really polite and well behaved while 7M has been acting out and misbehaving, I have nothing against him, and my SIL and BIL aren't really the type of parents to let their kids run around, breaking things and doing whatever they want, I'll give them that much. 

Yesterday at a party, my baby got hungry while we were all eating cake. I had already asked my mother and father in law if it was okay for me to nurse her wherever I want because she might get hungry while we're all chatting or hanging out or if the would prefer I do it inside, I didn't mind because it was FIL's birthday after all. They both said that I could do it wherever I want because when my SIL got pregnant they never asked her to do it somewhere else and it was just fair, so I thanked them. I was wearing a sundress so when she cried, I just popped a boob and nursed her right there. My nephew (7M) told my BIL ''Daddy! Boobie, boobie! Aunt \[OP\] has her boobie out'' and 4M just said ''boobie?'' with the sweetest voice. My BIL cleared his throat and asked me to go inside because his kids were seeing me, I said no because FIL and MIL already said it was okay and that her kids had to deal with it, my SIL asked him to stop and truth is, they didn't care for that long and both kids went back to their cake quickly. 

He was seating near me and he just got a little more close and whispered ''I swear it... If you were my woman you would've breastfeed inside'' I just smiled and said out loud ''If I have to breastfeed inside, then you have to go and be insufferable somewhere else sweetie''  He got hella mad of course, but said nothing else and when we were leaving, my SIL said that it was wrong and my MIL kinda agreed, since MIL was the host, I'm feeling a bit bad, so AITA?",15960,u40snr,"NTA.

AITA for refusing to show proof that the car is mine and embarrassing a guy in front of the police officer?,"For some context my (20M) mom (38F) married my step-dad (35M) 10 years ago, they had my brother (8M) Scott. I see my step-dad as my father and his family as my paternal family so I'll refer to him as dad and my step-grandad as Gran.

My dad has a GTR that my Gran gave him a few years ago, that car is sick as fuck, he also has a normal car that he drives to work so the GTR is more for fun and show off, my bro and I love that car and my dad lets me drive it whenever I want, he even added me to the insurance when I turned 19 because I used the car almost everyday until I was able to buy my own. 

Last week I noticed Scott a bit sad and he said that some kids were bullying him, our parents went to his school to talk to the principal and the problem is somewhat fixed, but he was still bummed, so I decided to surprise him yesterday by picking him up in our dad's car. I parked the car and got out to wait for him, I was sitting in the trunk when a guy approached me and said that I shouldn't sit in other people's car, I laughed it off and said that it was mine so it wasn't a problem, I must admit that I do look younger than 20 so he might've mistaken me for a high schooler and didn't believe me, he said that the car couldn't be mine and that I should go down before the owner got back, I said that it was my car again and he got mad and said ''look son, this isn't your car, get down, I'll even take a picture or two of you with it''. I was getting nervous, and when I get nervous I tend to laugh so he thought I was mocking him and yelled at me to get down that if the car belonged to me to show him proof, then he yelled that I was trying to steal the car. 

I asked him to leave me alone because I was waiting for my brother and he did moved a few meters, but then I noticed that he was making a call and it tuned out that he called the police on me! My brother was getting out at the same time, he was really happy to see me there in our dad's car and ran to hug me, I tried to pick him up to get him in but the guy stopped me. I mean, I opened the door! It was obvious that the car was mine at that point. 

Either way, the police came and asked the normal questions, I explained them that it was my dad's car (and the guy said JA! I knew it wasn't yours), I showed them proof; my license, my dad's papers, the insurance paper with my name on it and even a text with my dad where I said ''hey, I'm gonna pick up Scott in the car'' and he only answered with an OK, I offered to call him so they could ask him themselves but they said there was no need. The police let me leave and scolded the other guy. Before driving off the guy called me an AH because I could've just show him all of that but I preferred to be ''a dick''.",15943,urvwe0,NTA.

"AITA for not realising that ""little people"" meant ""children""?","Edit: Phew I'm glad I'm not nuts but I just wanna clarify my boss didn't throw me under the bus! He told the lady very professionally to go away and quit bothering us and then laughed at me afterwards, because in retrospect it is pretty funny

Edit the second: Not 24 hours after posting this I encountered someone calling children ""little people"" for the SECOND time in my life. What in the hell, I guess this is a thing now

Ok this sounds stupid as hell but it's driving me nuts... I recently got a job at a climbing gym. We have bouldering and ropes. I got a call from a lady asking if it was appropriate for a group of little people. Now I assumed she meant, you know, people with dwarfism, short-statured people, etc. It's not like we have a policy for that but I know people with some forms of dwarfism might have issues with their bones or joints or whatever so I tell her it should be ok but all climbing is at your own risk so if they have any medical issues they should ask their doctor. Well the day of their booking comes around and it turns out the ""little people"" are actually like a dozen SMALL CHILDREN. This was a fucking disaster because there is a strict 2 kids per 1 adult ratio for kids in the gym, and also kids aren't allowed to belay until they've been assessed, so we pretty much had to tell them that they couldn't come inside. The lady goes off on me for ruining their weekend and I have to get my manager to bail me out, after which he laughs his ass off but also calls me a dumbass for not understanding that she was talking about kids. Who the fuck refers to children as ""little people""? Was I really supposed to anticipate that this woman's use of an extremely specific term actually referred to another group of people entirely??

AITA for telling my MIL I want to fuck her son?,"Throwaway 

So my (28f) husband (31m) had to spend two months in a different state for work. He came back 9 days ago. I am obviously thrilled he’s back and I’ve missed him a lot. I was hoping we would be able to spend some time together just the two of us. However his mom (56f) came over when he was supposed to come home. I was slightly annoyed but I know she was just excited for her son to be back. However she never left. Like I was prepared to deal with her being there for a day or two but no 9 days.

Because she’s been here for nine days we haven’t had a second of time together. She insists on staying here instead of a hotel. (For the record she lives an hour away.) the guest room is right next to ours and the walls are thin. When the two of us go out she comes with us. Or makes one of us stay with her bc otherwise we would be “bad hosts”. She follows us around the house constantly. We want to cuddle and watch movies she’s sitting in the arm chair. We want to go to a romantic restaurant better make that a table for three. We have even left her in the living room to go “chat” in our room and she follows us. 

Earlier today I just asked her to leave. (Even though both us have been hinting that she needs to go.) She kept saying she wasn’t ready to go yet and wanted more time with her son. I tried telling her we wanted some alone time and she kept insisting that she join us. Finally I snapped and said “Since you seem to be oblivious, I will put this bluntly. I want to fuck your son. If you don’t want to see or hear then you need to leave.” (Ik this isn’t the classiest response ever but I was frustrated.) Anyway she yelled at me but eventually left. We finally got to have our “alone time.” But now she is blowing up both of our phones. She is saying that I am disgusting and have no respect for her, her son, or myself. She keeps telling my husband that he shouldn’t be with someone so crude and how dare he let me speak to her like that. I’m sure you get the idea. Ik that what I said was really inappropriate so AITA?

Edit: after reading these comments I will definitely let my husband know he needs to step up. I agree that it should’ve been him who made her leave. I love him to death and want to be accommodating to his fear of making her angry (she’s nasty when she’s angry and will turn his whole family against him). However he needs to set boundaries.",15928,vj2062,"This lady is trying to break up with your marriage. Keep your husband on side and make sure you’re a united front on responses

AITA for getting my fiance's family gifts that were too personal for Christmas when I'm new to them?,"I'm engaged to Noah and this was the first Christmas I spent with his family. I met them in the summer after we moved to be near his family now that he's finished with college. We're getting married in February and we're expecting our first child together in May. Being someone who has no family and seeing how close his family was, I wanted to make sure I showed my appreciation for them with the gifts I gave so I tried to get something each person would love. One of his sisters loves to read and so I made a book sleeve for her with little details from all her favorite books. One of his nieces is on the spectrum and has wanted clothes for her stuffy, so I made some clothes for her to put on the stuffy. I bought his mom a jewelry box that she had admired a couple of times after she mentioned never having a real one. For his dad I bought him a frame for his office big enough to hold photos of his whole family on, since he always complained he couldn't find one big enough or nice enough, and had no more room for individual frames. I included photos Noah had provided me in it. I got his other sister her favorite makeup which she mentioned she couldn't afford to buy lately. Then I got his brother a signed piece of memorabilia from his favorite sports team. For the rest of the nieces and nephews, I bought wish list items the parents weren't getting.

Noah thought they would love everything. He told me I didn't need to go to the effort I did (I spent weeks tracking everything down and searching for certain items) but he really thought they'd like them. But when Christmas Day happened I could tell something was off. I spent the whole time worrying that I had bought them stuff they didn't like anymore or something. They said nothing. But then the next day they asked Noah what the hell I was thinking and I was like some kind of stalker buying them such personal stuff when I'm an almost stranger to them. The next day we saw them again and I apologized for the gifts I gave them and told them I would be a lot more mindful in the future. I offered to make it up to them. One of his sister's called me a stalker to my face and told me it was no wonder my family didn't want me if I was so creepy to do stuff like that. Noah yelled at her. I apologized again and told them I didn't want to hurt anyone and I would learn from this. They told me I had overstepped. Noah said we were leaving and they owed me an apology. I feel so bad. Noah is supporting me and told me I did nothing wrong. But surely there wouldn't be so much offense if that were true. I need to ask AITA?

Also, not sure if this is relevant or not but I grew up in an unhappy home. My parents were unkind to me and my sister. She was much older and also hated me. I think maybe because of how our parents treated her. But I ended up with nobody who wanted me by the time I was 16 and I was homeless for a good period after that. That's what Noah's sister meant. I had told them honestly when they asked.

ETA: I wanted to clarify something that might sound strange. I had spoken to them on the phone before but we had not met in person until this year. With Covid and us living in a different city at the time I had not gotten the chance. But they were genuinely all close before this.

Sorry for another edit! I just wanted to clarify that we had met in person before Christmas, and more than once too, but I feel like I messed up expressing that here. I met them for the first time in the summer. Also, since people have been asking, they got me gift cards and they did not return the gifts.

Just wanted to thank everyone for commenting. I am going to talk about what happened with my therapist and work on building up some more confidence in myself. I'm a work in progress. I have been in therapy for a while now but it's the first time I have been able to see a really good therapist. My history has left me with not very much belief in myself and my confidence has never been good. I never ever meant to make anyone awkward, uncomfortable or to make someone feel bad. I can see from a few comments that there are those who believe I was majorly wrong and should have known better. I didn't. It was my first Christmas with a family setting and my fiance is the only person I have shared Christmas with. But I know that what I did is not wanted by his family so I will accept that and work on being okay with that. I won't apologize again or be the try hard. Noah wants to talk to his family when he calms down but that might take a bit because he's angry and is ready to not see them again if they don't apologize. The kindness of so many people here made me cry and helped me to take some comfort in the fact I wasn't in the wrong for what I did. But I do appreciate the honesty also from people who would not like it and can see that for some it's just too much.",15924,zz3u09,"NTA

And if my son ever brings home someone so considerate and sweet, I will make sure he knows she's the best woman he can ever hope for, and he better treats her like the angel she is!

I can't get behind people who don't want nice gifts. I would be happy to be seen in my interests and/or needs.

Not your fault.

Also Noah sticking up for you is great. He knows why he loves you, for sure.",4817,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zz3u09/aita_for_getting_my_fiances_family_gifts_that/
AITA for leaving after I found out my SIL was lying about her food allergy?,"I, (F18), turned 18 in early August. 

For my 18th birthday, I wanted to go out and celebrate with my family by going to my favorite Chinese restaurant. 

I'm quite a picky eater (I'm autistic and have issues with textures) but any type of Asian food is safe food for me. When it comes to more Western cuisine, I don't have a lot of options unless I make it at home.

Everything was organised and ready to go, but a week prior to my birthday, my brother's fiancée Vicky (F27) said that she can't go. She said she has a seafood allergy, and after contacting the restaurant, they said they can't realistically cater to her and politely advised that she doesn't eat there.

Vicky and my brother suggested that we go to this Italian restaurant instead. Everyone was on board but...I hate Italian food. The textures of cheese, pasta and just all of it is just gross to me.

I got upset because it was supposed to be a dinner for *my* birthday, and it was like I got forgotten about. I talked to my parents and they told me to stop complaining, Vicky can't help having an allergy.

I sucked it up and went. I spent my birthday miserable, and ended up just sneaking in my own snacks into the restaurant.

Well, last weekend I spontaneously went over to my brother's house with no warning because I had forgotten my hoodie there from a few days prior. 

My brother let me inside and I saw Vicky sat on the couch scoffing tuna like it's nobody's business.

Me: I thought you were allergic to seafood?

Vicky: What are you talking about?

Me: My 18th birthday last month. You said we couldn't go to the Chinese restaurant because you're allergic to seafood.

Vicky: Well I'm not *medically* allergic, I just can't stand the smell of all those shrimps and prawns. It makes me feel nauseous.

Me: So you ruined my 18th birthday because you don't like how seafood smells. Wow.

I stormed out and blocked Vicky and my brother on everything. I couldn't believe this. 

I talked to my parents. They think I'm being dramatic, and that it's just a restaurant, and told me to apologise to Vicky for speaking to her like that in her home. 

I was so angry, I went to go stay with my bf's family for a few days who very kindly let me stay. My family thinks I went super overboard, and are calling me a brat and entitled. I don't know how to feel.

Was I the AH?

Edit: Thank you for the wonderful comments and awards. I hope you all have a great day.",15914,xaiuz2,"NTA. Not even in the slightest.

AITA for not going by my dad's because he always sides with his girlfriend and her daughter,"My parents split custody, it's pretty random some days I'm home and sometimes I'm by my dad. I'm 15f.

Dad started dating Jane a while ago,  maybe a year. She has a daughter Mandy that's 12 or 13 I think. Then they started spending A LOT of time by my dad's.  They have their own apartment but they're still always by him. 

The first time they stayed over when I was there somehow Mandy ended up in my bed. Her mom has this cot/bed thing she brought by my dads for her but somehow I woke up in the middle of the night and she was in my bed. I kicked her out.  Then my dad and Jane said ""that was mean and I have a full anyway so I should share"". 

 There's other stuff,  I have a chair in my dad's living room I got for my a gift.  It's comfy and when I move out it'll go with me.  Well Mandy always wants to race for the chair,  even when I win the ""race"" my dad makes me let her sit in it because they're guests.  So I end up sitting on the floor because my dad has a recliner and Jane lays across the couch. So I stay in my room instead, my dad's tried getting me to come out there by them, but why when I have to sit on the floor like a dog?  He keeps saying ""I'm being a difficult teenager "" that's not it though.  

One time my mom and I went and did some stuff before she dropped me off. She had bought me a blanket that had my favorite teams logo on it. I was excited to sleep with it (stupid I know) so she let me take it by my dads.  My dad made me ""share"" it with Mandy, because it wasn't fair that I got something and Mandy didn't.  

It's not just the blanket it's happened with it's anything that I have I have to share, but if Mandy has something I'd like to use he tells me it's hers and if she doesn't want to let me she doesn't have to. 

One time mandy was reading one of my books, and Jane and my dad started fighting, Jane wanted to leave so Mandy wanted to take my book but I said no. So she wouldn't leave. My dad yelled at me to ""just let her have it"". They made up so I got it back, but if they didn't I would have lost one of my favorite books. 

My dad and I had plans to go ice fishing,  just him and I something we've done since I was 7. Well he brought Jane and Mandy along. All they did was complain, ""it's to cold"" ""fish are gross"" ""this is boring "". So we left early.  He said ""sometimes you have to compromise"". 

When I got home I was mad,  my mom was annoyed and  called him and they argued and he talked to me and repeated his compromising crap. 

 I was supposed to go back by him a few days later but decided I didn't want to, I never even spend time with just him anymore so what's the point in going there. 

I told my mom she said it was my choice. So we told him, he said ""I'm just used to being a only child and I can't be spoiled my whole life"". And ""I can't run away whenever there's a problem "".

Well since then, his family is trying to get me to go back too.

AITA for not visiting my dad anymore


Edit: Some people have said to go to family counseling.  He won't do that. He put me in therapy a few years back,  because I wasn't doing my homework, seriously that's the reason.  Then when my therapist started calling him out on his parenting he didn't want to go anymore and my mom had to take me. My therapist even called him to try to talk to him and my dad ignored it.",15916,t3j4sr,"NTA at all.

Your dad is prioritizing his new girlfriend and he daughter over your needs and wants. Mandy wants something, she gets it.

Your chair? Mandy gets it. Your book? Mandy gets it. Your new blanket? Mandy gets it.

Your dad and Jane enable the behavior, and your dad's choices have shown you he doesn't prioritize your relationship with him

I wouldn't want to go somewhere where I am made to feel like a 2nd class citizen.

When your dad asks why you don't want to go over anymore, send him exactly what you have written here. 

I am so glad your mom supports you and stands up for you. <3

AITA for telling my kids babysitter that it was inappropriate of her to shower in my home?,"

I hired a babysitter for my 5 and 3 year old kids 2 weeks ago. My husband works shifts while I work long hours at a marketing company.


So far we've had no issues til yesterday. I came home at 6pm and noticed the babysitter's wet hair and new clothes. She told me she took a shower after one of the kids spilled milk on her. I was confused but visibly upset but she tried to ""reassure"" me the kids were fine, because my husband watched them while she took her shower which only lasted for few minutes. I was more confused that my husband was home when he had a shift to cover. I told her I didn't think it was appropriate of her to shower in my home like that. She argued that it was fine and that she had no choice and couldn't leave the milk on her like that. We argued and my husband heard the commotion and got involved. He said it was not as big of a deal as I was making it out to be but I told the babysitter that I did not appreciate how she basically ignored how I felt about this and dismissed my feelings still. She went home, but we still argued on the phone. She thinks she's done nothing wrong and said I was being unfair when I mentioned potentially cutting from her salary after that.


My husband keeps saying that I'm overreacting and the ""poor girl"" couldn't handle having milk stains on her body and clothes. But I couldn't help feel it was inappropriate and she shouldve checked with me.



AITA for my reaction? Just for info. I'm the one who pays her, not my husband. I told her to call or text (always available) if anything happens. I didn't even know my husband was home at the time! If you noticed, I said that I argued with her even before she told me my husband was home. And no I didn't know how big the stain was but she argued about being covered in milk for 6+hrs. As for the question of why my husband didn't go to work? He said he was feeling a bit sick and swapped shifts with a coworker.

She said she has experience and yes she normally brings a bag of clothes, wet wipes and stuff like that with her.",15907,ygpn3f,Are you really just concerned about a quick shower and some spilt milk?

AITA for turning around in my car when I saw that my boyfriend brought his friends with him to go on a trip with us?,"
I f30 am dating my boyfriend ""Smith"" m39 for 8+ months. We have been planning to go on a roadtrip but it couldn't happen because he kept insisting that we let his 2 friends tag along.

He brought it up again and promised that he won't ask me to let him bring his friends with him since (1) I'm the one paying for the expenses. and (2) It's my car. (3) I always wanted us to go alone for once without having his friends tag along. (4) I don't wanna pay for his friends.


We agreed that I'd come pick him up in the morning so we could ago. I came in my car and entered his neighborhood. However, when I saw him standing outside with his bag AND his 2 friends were also standing there with their bags, I was shocked and furious. I didn't pull over I just turned around and kept driving and went back home. I saw him running after me in the rearview mirror. He then stopped and started calling me. I did not respond til I got home.


He lashed out on me on the phone asking why the hell I turned around and left. I told him why and how I didn't appreciate how he basically tried to force me to take his friends with us after I said ""no"" already. He called me awful amd said that I ruined the entire thing for us and acted immaturely and spitefully. He said I could've just accepted it how it is but I told him  that I would never accept being put in a situation where I'm expected to just ""suck it up"". He hung up after yelling at me for few minutes.


I called back but got no response. He texted about how embarrassed him infront of his friends and is refusing to speak to me til after I apologize.

I ( 30F) have been a fat girl since very young, and last year it got to the point where I weighted 120 kg/242 pounds on a 160 cm/5.4 ft height. No matter how hard I tried, exercise and diet were not enough. So I went to my endocrinologist and we started a medicine that is the new ""trend"" for obese patients. I wont give the name for safety reasons. 

The treatment was like a miracle. After been 1 year on it ( and obviously with more exercise and diet), I am only 20 kg/40 pounds away from my ideal weight. I know it sounds like a lot but believe me, is a huge step forward. I have never been this skinny, and it shows. 

Enter my friend Jesse (28F). Jesse is also a chubby girl, not on the level I was but still enough to affect her self - esteem. Long story short, Jesse asked me how I have done it, I told her about the medicine and the dosage I used and that was it. I thought she would try to the same therapy, but , you know, with the help of a doctor. 

She didn't. She bought the medicine and used it. Guys, this medicine has to be managed very carefully. You start with a very low volume and then increase to my current one. A process that takes MONTHS. She used the full dosis on the first try. 

Basically, she completely reseted her digestive system: Pain worst than an appendicitis, projectile puke, explosive diarrhea, among others. Probably did some mild damage to her pancreas too. She entered the ER and left the hospital 5 days later. 

Jesse, her family and even some of our common friends are blaming me for what happened, and she is also asking me to pay her not only the money she spent on the drug ( more or less $500 U.S.A dollars)  but also the hospitals costs, as her insurance won't cover it because she poisoned herself with a drug not send by a doctor.

AITA for refusing to move my husband's service dog out of the housebecause my niece is uncomfortable?,"
I'm gonna be quick.

My husband is disabled (won't expand on that for privacy) we got him a service dog 4 months ago to help him on a daily basis. My brother and his family lost their home and asked to move in with us for few weeks til they find another place to stay. Thing is, my niece (14) started complaining about the service dog making her ""uncomfortable"" it's strange, no allergies no nothing but she's just uncomfortable. She told my brother and he asked if I could move the dog. I said absolutely not. this dog is literally as helpful as a human being when it comes to people with disabilities, and he's incredibly smart and more IMPORTANTLY, he minds his own business and never bothers my niece but she's ""just uncomfortable"" with him for some reason! My brother and his wife started begging saying it's temporary but I refused. They said that my husband doesn't really need the dog much as of now since he's home most of the time, yet I still refused. They tried talking to my husband directly, but I shut that down immedietly. My brother's wife started an argument with me right after my brother went to work and she started yelling about how I value a dog over my niece and her comfort. I said it wasn't just the dog, but it's my husband who needs him. My brother came home and we kept arguing. He said that I was being unsupportive and cruel to my niece who's already been through enough, My husband got involved and asked me to take him to his father's house with the dog but I said no, not after what his dad said to him and that him AND the dog are staying.

My brother and his wife are in the guests room sulking hard while my niece is ignoring me. Meanwhile, My husband is sitting in the kitchen now trying to convince me to let him go stay with his dad's to keep the peace with my brother. This man (my husband) is like this all the time!!! always willing to do what others want just to ""keep the peace"". You can literally cuss him out and he'll apologize to you like it was his fault!!! He thinks he owes people for accepting him as a disabled man which's sad. And, It's true he's home most of the time but, he still needs his service dog throughout the day.

WIBTA if my spouse and I had just appetizers for our wedding guests but a full roast chicken for ourselves at the wedding?,"We're trying to save money where possible for the wedding ceremony and are using Publix for the catering. My wife thinks the guests will be ok just eating finger foods such as fruit/vegetable trays, assorted cheeses, wings, chicken tenders... but she knows she'll be hungry and won't be satisfied with just those. She wants just her and I to also have a roast chicken at the table (I think some sides to). I think it would be incredibly rude to have an openly much better meal than our guests would have. Us tearing apart a full bird while they munch on tenders. Conversely I'd be perfectly fine with just the appetizers for everyone, us included. The costs for every table to get a roast chicken would put us at like $30 a plate according to her and that's not saving money. With every decision we make she justifies them by going ""It's OUR wedding! It's ours, not anybody else's!"". She didn't want to have a wide variety of options to cater to others either. She only wanted stuff she'd like. I think we'd be total assholes to go through with her idea. Thoughts?",15863,vraao6,"YWBTA.

AITA for refusing to give up my seat(s) and being crass about it?,"I (36F) flew home for Thanksgiving this week and got an early flight this morning so I would be able to do laundry tomorrow and relax before going back to work.

I am a plus-size woman (the cause was finally diagnosed after three years of weight gain, I've lost 4 lbs in the last four weeks!), so when I booked my flights, I spent extra money and booked two adjacent seats so whoever had the third seat in my row would not have to be squished up in my business. Flying out was great, the other person in my row was cool and we shared the middle seat and snacks and played pokemon on our switches and visited each other's animal crossing islands.

Flying home was where things became a bit more problematic.

I was settled into my pair of seats, and a gentleman tried to sit his daughter (\~12, not a waif, nor was her overweight dad) in my middle seat, where my bum is taking up a good third of the middle seat. I said politely, ""I'm sorry, that seat is booked. Your daughter can't sit there,"" while putting my hand on the other 2/3s of the seat.

He immediately complained that he hadn't been able to book seats together and he needed to sit with his daughter. I shrugged and said I was sorry, but it wasn't my problem, that wasn't his seat.

He called over a stewardess to complain, I explained my situation and showed my pair of tickets, and the flight attendant offered to comp my extra seat. I said no thank you, I needed the extra room and waved to where my bum was partway into the middle seat.

The stewardess came back ten minutes later with a wife from a couple who agreed to switch seats so the man could sit with his daughter. But not without attempting to shame me for not be willing to help out a dad in need and commenting about how selfish I was. (Edit: the woman who switched seats was rude, not the stewardess! The stewardess was nothing but polite!)

I said, ""I booked early, and I booked two seats together because to put it plainly, I'm fat. His two seats were separate seats. How exactly do you propose I split my fat ass in half to sit one half in one seat and the other half in his other seat?""

The woman turned red in the face and bitched at me for being ""disgusting"", I replied that his lack of planning was not my emergency, and she scowled at me for the entire rest of the flight. When I told my folks about it after I landed, my dad thought it was the funniest thing he'd ever heard, but my mom yelled at him for encouraging him and said I should have been more willing to help out a dad with a kid when I had two seats.

So I want to know, AITA?

AITA for refusing to let my husband pull 14k out of my account without signing a contract?,"I (f36) have been married to my husband (m42) for 2 years. I've never been married before him but he was married twice and has 6 kids. He requested our finances to be split. Fine by me, because seeing how he blows through his money is so frusrtating. He says he has kids, commitments and has to provide but I don't think that kids would need that much money to live like the other kids. his bank account is always almost empty, Whileas mine has over 20k. We take turns paying for daily expenses and stuff.



Lately, he's been struggling with money. He borrowed from a number of people including my own brother, about 4k from him just a week ago. he just seemed desperate for money. I asked what the deal was and he said that he needed the money for the kids which seemed fishy since kids don't really need that much money for their expenses. the eldest is 16!!!!!.



He came and asked to borrow 14k from me, Pull it from my account and into his. I tried asking him what he needed the money for but he said it was none of my business, then insisted that he'll return it asap. I said okay, but under the condition, that he sign a contract stating he'll return the money in full. He acted all shocked and offended then went on about how I don't trust him and his word. I told him that's all I got and this was my one and only condition. He kept ranting about how I'm refusing to help and making the situation more difficult for him instead of co-operating. I insisted on a contract to be signed before he even pulls a penny and this morning when I told him this one more time, he blew up and said that we're family and that I should be ashamed for involving courts and lawyers between family. he left the house and was so upset he hasn't responded to any of my calls yet.

AITA for refusing to pay the babysitter for new glasses after my daughter broke her old ones?,"

I'll preface this by saying that I (M35) am a widower with 2 kids (9, 11). I recently got back to work and since I work nightshifts, I had to get the kids a babysitter (they're at school during the day and my sister stays with them) I was able to find a babysitter with the help of a co worker (actually they're related) and things have been going pretty well except for few days ago.


The babysitter called me while I was at work to tell me that my 9 year old daughter broke her glasses, I got home, heard both sides of the story and came to a conclusion that it was in fact an accident. but the babysitter said my daughter broke them intentionally after she refused to let her outside late in the evening. I asked my 11 year old daughter and she said the babysitter's story is accurate but since she and her sister have a beef then, I figured she lied to set her sister up. my 9 year old daughter cried and said she didn't mean it and it was an accident. I apologized to the babysitter for the misunderstanding but she insisted there was no misunderstanding and then asked me to pay her for a pair of new glasses. I was taken aback by her request and told her I thought we talked this out and rolled it out as an accident but she insisted it wasn't an accident. I apologized but refused and said it was unfair to expect me to pay, especially since she didn't pay attention to keep her glasses safe regardless of wether it was an accident or not. The babysitter argued with me then started crying swearing that my daughter broke them to get back at her. My 11 year old daughter sided with her but my 9 year old said she is only siding with the babysitter for her own benefits. The girls started fighting and I ended up telling the babysitter to leave. she got my co worker involved and she said I should take responsibility and pay the babysitter for new glasses since she can not afford them being a broke college student and in need for glasses. I apologized but refused to pay, my co worker got upset and shamed me for condoning my younger daughter's actions and treating the babysitter poorly when she's the victim in this situation.


It's been days and the babysitter is still wanting me to pay for new glasses but I feel like she's trying to use the fact that I'm in dire need of help and is hoping to get extra money out of my pocket.",15856,st1pg0,"YTA

Do you even hear yourself? Whether it was an accident or not is irrelevant, however in this case it be seems more likely that your younger daughter is lying because she's afraid of being in trouble. What is relevant is your daughter was involved in breaking the babysitter's MEDICALLY NECESSARY equipment, while she was working for you. 

I suspect this is not the only example in your life when you've tried to weasel out of paying for something you should be responsible for. Just pay for the new glasses already.

If your babysitter is STILL babysitting for you while you stiff her, I hope she wises up and stops. Babysitters are a valuable resource, and this one is making it possible for you to earn your living.",3775,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/st1pg0/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_the_babysitter_for_new/
AITA because I won't cook for roommates?,"About five months ago, I struck an agreement with my roommates. My husband and I live with two other people, and we have a pretty small fridge, so there was never any room for anything in it, because there were always two households' worth of ingredients stocked in it. Plus, it was getting pretty annoying having two sets of people ""fight"" (not really) over the same kitchen every day when it was time to cook dinner. So I proposed a deal: everyone contribute into a communal dinner budget, and I would cook dinner for all four of us every day. I'm great at economising and cooking on a low budget, and not to toot my own horn or anything but cooking is a huge hobby of mine so I feel confident saying I'm not too shabby at that, either.

I like to cook a wide range of foods, which is something my husband loves. For example, Japanese-style ramen, Chinese braised pork over rice, Moroccan curry, shakshuka, pasta salad, grilled fish with roasted vegetables, and authentic Italian carbonara are all things that might show up on the dinner table when I cook.

Things went well for a while, but after a couple of months our roommates started making requests. That's fine! Sometimes I would even ask for ideas on what to cook. But then the restrictions came. And came. And came. And just kept piling on. Now the list is:

no pasta

no curry

no rosemary

no thyme

no oregano

no provincial herbs

no olives

no asian noodles

no soy sauce

no oyster sauce

no peanut-based sauces

no chickpeas

no lamb

no pesto

no basmati rice

no pork belly

no sun-dried tomatoes

no szechuan pepper, or szechuan pepper oil

no vinegar

no balsamic

no couscous

no shrimp

no fennel

no garam masala

no sugar

low salt

I am sure there are plenty that I forgot but they would definitely be mentioned if I used.

I like to be adventurous when I cook and I just got really, really tired of being so limited. It honestly felt like I was being handed a new restriction every other day after a while. So I stopped cooking for them, and went back to only cooking for my husband and I. But my roommates are pretty upset that I'm not cooking anymore. They have started hinting that they would like me to cook for them again and I just say no.

AITA? For throwing my stepson's Father's Day gift out of my house?,"Let me preface this by saying that I (38M) struggled with alcoholism for 3 years. It was the most difficult period of my life. I'm now 3 years sober and doing so much better with my life. 

I got married to my wife last year and have a stepson (16M) 'Jake'. Jake and I aren't really close but we have a cordial relationship, his dad's in the picture so it's pretty clear that he never sees me as a dad. 

Jake has done a number of things in the past that caused us to fight like getting into trouble and making me pay for damages, Or damaging my own things and having me pay for them. He also constantly mocks my soberty every chance he gets. Some issues got worked out with time but the ""mocking"" is pretty much still there. I told him, told my wife how this makes me feel but got nowhere. 

Father's day comes and my wife's family came over to celebrate with us. We had dinner and then Jake surprised me with a gift saying it was for me for Father's day which I thought was sweet (completely out of character for him to get me anything). However, from the way he was smug smiling I just didn't feel comfortable. Anyway...I opened it and behold...there was a flask and a glass.......frankly? I felt like he just made fun of, or mocked one of the biggest, most difficult struggles in my entire life. I froze...I didn't know what to say or how to act since everyone was literally watching me. Jake was giggling hard and that's when I got pissed. I put everything back, then grabbed the box and told him ""this doesn't belong in my house"" then I opened the door, walked up to the trash can and threw the entire thing in there. My wife, her mom and my stepson were at the door watching. Jake went downstairs and my wife started arguing with me about what I did, we got into an argument that's when her parents left. My wife got more upset saying how I reacted was childish and that Jake was just ""teasing"" me and I should loosen up and stop being dramatic. I refused to get engaged any further and now there's just so much tension in the house and silence from my in-laws.


AITA for how I handled it?",15845,vgj2lw,"NTA.  Doing something shitty and calling it a joke doesn’t make it suddenly not shitty. At best it’s a bad, offensive accident and at worst it’s this. 

Your stepson is a bully. Instead of protecting you from this bully, your wife is supporting it. If your stepson and wife are not willing to be allies and support for you in your sobriety, maybe they aren’t the best people for you to be around. If she genuinely thinks her son’s gift was an appropriate joke and not a mean, nasty prank, that is deeply concerning.

AITA for walking out of my husband's birthday party after he started laughing at me?,"

I f32 just completed my treatment for a medical issue that affected my body. I had gained weight due to this medical condition and also medication and none of my old clothes were fitting anymore. I bought new fitting clothes but for my husband's birthday party, he asked me to wear one of my old dresses that was one of his favorites. To appease him I said yes although I didn't feel comfortable wearing it especially after the weight gain.


He was at the restaurant with his family and friends when I arrived with my sister. As soon as he saw me walking in, he busted out laughing....he pointed at the dress and was going hysterical saying ""oh my God"" I felt so incredibly mad. Especially when the others started laughing as well. One of his friends started whistling in a mocking tone. I turned around instantly and walked out and my sister followed me. I went home and cried a little but he kept calling non stop.


He came home and started talking about how oversensitive I was and that ""it was just a natural reaction"" he had upon seeing me in this dress again after all this time. He said I overreacted and made a scene over nothing. He also said I ruined his birthay and urged me to get therapy for this oversensitivity that I'm inflicting upon him.



AITA? Did I overreact? He's so upset he refused to even recieve the gift.

Edit! I need to explain the way he laughed more. He first started giggling and tried to cover his mouth then, in a matter of seconds he bursted out laughing. In the middle of the restaurant. The guests were confused then they must've understood why he was laughing because they joined in and his friend whistled at me mockingly while repeatedly turning his head like something caught his ""attention"". Could it be the I overreacted? It could be just me getting overwhelmed because joking and laughing is not new when it comes to him. He's the kind to tease about any and everything even with family. The kids also.

He also said he was ""caught off guard"" and so I shouldn't blame him for his reaction.",15819,yp4muc,"NTA and my jaw dropped. I legitimately cannot imagine my husband even thinking of doing that.

AITA for reporting my daughter’s teacher to the principle?,"My daughter is 6 and is grade 2 but only been remote until a few months ago so she hasn’t physically been in school for long. Recently she told me she didn’t want her packed lunches anymore and what to eat what the other kids were eating. She had been not wanting to eat what were her favourite foods and opting for asking for pizza more. 

I asked her why she didn’t to eat her favourite foods anymore and she told me she wanted to be able to sit with the other students. I was shocked because I didn’t know she wasn’t sitting with the other students and she told me it was because her teacher made her sit in the other room by herself during lunch times because she brought “smelly foods”. 

To be clear growing up I was also targeted by teachers who wouldn’t let me bring shrimp or anything with garlic or onion because they hated the smell. So I try not to pack anything that could cause them to target my child like spam sushi or egg fried rice.

Another teacher confirmed her had seen her eatting alone and her home room teacher switched stories that she had but it was because my daughter brought a persimmon to school and it was distracting the other kids because they thought she was eating a tomato and she didn’t want her distracting the other students by having “foreign” food. 

She refused to believe it was inappropriate and said she didn’t see anything wrong with sending her to eat by herself. I had to go to the principle and take my daughter to another home room to finish up the school year because that teacher said it only happened once despite my daughter swearing up and down it happened every few days for weeks before she told me.

Fastforward to this past friday. My daughter called me at work saying her stepbrother took her car while she was upstairs after he demanded the keys and she refused.

He called his son then called me back saying his son was just taking it to go to the movies with his friends and will bring it back at 9pm. I couldn't wait. I watned him one more time to bring it back but he stalled. I called the police and reported it stolen. My stepson was picked up from his location and brought in to the local police station.

AITA for sitting back and doing nothing when mom told my wife that she'd take us to court for grandparents right?,"This situation is a bit of a mess. I'll just mention the relevent conflict at hand.


So My wife Liz and I have been married for 7 years. we have preschool age kids, and because we currently live in the same city as my parents. Mom would take the kids while my wife and I work.


Liz is the one with a much larger income, she got an even better job opportunity that is requiring us to move to another city. I agreed since I could easily find a job in my field in the city we're moving to. but after my family heard we were selling the house to move, hell broke loose.

Sunday, mom and Liz got into a huge fight because Liz told mom we'll move away and hire a babysitter for the kids so she's no longer ""needed"". mom said she doesn't want her grandkids moving away, even said we should let the kids live at her house while we move. Liz laughed at her and mom lost it basically saying that Liz was an ungrateful witch and that her grandkids moving will only happen over her dead body. they began exchanging harsher words and Liz snapped and told mom to butt out of private matters that don't concern her. and said that she had no right to decide things regarding the kids. Mom firmly told her she was dead wrong and proceeded to tell her that she, as an involved grandmother, knows her rights and she will be taking Liz and me to court to ensure she still gets to see her grankids. Liz was in shock, she looked to the left and saw me sitting there not saying or doing anything. She told me to check my mom but I told her she was being unfair to mom and that mom had to feel upset because she will no longer be able to see her grandchildren - I honestly told Liz that she was a bit selfish to not consider my mom's feelings and her crucial presence in the kids life first. Liz started arguing with me saying she couldn't believe I didn't stand behind her and defend her after hearing mom saying she'd get the court involved. I said mom was upset and can not be blamed for her reaction. Liz started yelling at me calling me unsupportive and an enabler then went home with the kids, insisting my family is MY problem and I should handle it although this whole moving thing was her idea.

Situation hasn't been resolved and Liz and mom are getting more intense in their fights. I choose to stay out of it because both have valid arguments but Liz has called me awful for not siding with her after seeing how mom spoke to her and being okay with the fact that mom was willing to cause us issues in court.


AITA? I get that Liz wants my support but I feel like mom has been punished through no fault of her own after being a loving grandmother to my kids.",15731,snu4c8,">insisting my family is MY problem and I should handle it although this whole moving thing was her idea.

It may have been her idea, but you agreed to it. If you had an issue with moving, you should have had that conversation with your wife. Agreeing with it to your wife's face and then letting your mom do the dirty work of fighting her about it is cowardly and passive aggressive. The fact that you are continuing to sit there like a bump on a log while your relatives harass your wife is failing hardcore as a spouse. 

Get your mother out of your marriage or you won't *have* a marriage.

I’m a regular at a local coffee shop. I stop in nearly everyday on my lunch break so I’ve gotten to know the owners and most of the staff. They’re all great and I usually leave a 50% tip.

Yesterday I went and there was a girl I didn’t recognize behind the counter, I assume she’s new. I placed my usual order, medium light roast coffee, black with room. She turns around to pour the coffee and I notice her fill the cup up halfway with the light roast and the fills the rest up with the dark roast. She puts the cup in front of me and I ask her why she filled the cup up with dark  roast when I ordered light roast. She said they ran out of light roast so she used the dark roast to top it off. 

I told her I don’t drink dark roast and she responded that it doesn’t make a difference because it’s all the same and she didn’t feel like putting on a new pot because it would take 6 mins. I told her it’s not all the same, which is why it’s labeled differently, and I would’ve waited for the fresh pot or ordered something else. She gave me a wtf look, said it’s industry standard to do that and walked to the back and didn’t come back out again. She sent out another worker I’m friendly with who apologized and got me the correct coffee.

I went in today and the owner was there and half-jokingly half-seriously asked why I was causing problems with his employee. I don’t feel comfortable going there anymore and I’m wondering if it really is a standard practice and I was just being an AH?",15724,sommxc,NTA.

"AITA for saying at a recruiting event, that I am trotted out as the token 'girl engineer' for every recruiting event?","See the bottom for an update...

I work at a tech company. I'm one of two women in a technical role, and the other is very introverted and wouldn't be great at recruiting. So every time there's a recruiting event, I get volun-told for it. It was especially frustrating and for me because my whole team is under crunch time and a day I spend recruiting is a day I have to make up later. 

I was at a recruiting event at a local college, and a young woman who was thinking of applying asked how the diversity at my company was, it looked good from our panel and promotional materials. (Side note... Almost every person of color, woman, or queer presenting person on the promo materials has either quit or never worked there in the first place) 

 I answered honestly in front of a small group ""Well, there are two women in technical roles, and as one of them it sometimes feels like working two jobs. One as an engineer, and one as the 'token girl engineer' who gets pulled away from work for every photo op, or recruiting event. Honestly, if you like being a trailblazer and are prepared to take on the extra unspoken PR as the ""girl engineer', you might find a role here fulfilling, but if you prefer keeping your head down to focus on the technical side, it is easier to do that at a company where there is more gender and racial diversity.

She appreciated my honestly but the manager who was running the event told me to leave. I have a meeting with HR and my manager tomorrow. I don't think my opinion will be any news to them as I've already told them I'm not interested in being assigned to photo ops or recruiting disproportionately because of my gender, and I've been told that it's ""important"" for me to be there to help recruit a more diverse staff since the company is trying to improve. 

I feel like they're mad that I said the quiet part out loud at the recruiting event... But it was a honest answer to the question, and I keep on being brought to these things for my ""unique perspective"" and whatnot.

I think they might also see themselves as doing something good, trying to do outreach to a more diverse applicant pool, and see me as ruining that. 

AITA for what I said about my job?

---(UPADTE AFTER THE MEETING)---

Edit - I had the meeting. I recorded it with their consent even though that was hard to come to an agreement on.

I basically said that as I understood it, they had asked me to recruit because they want more female applicants and felt I could help recruit in a way the men on the team wouldn't. And that they wanted me there to share my unique perspective as a woman in the feild, is that correct?

My manager and HR confirmed that. 

I said that that role is often referred to as a ""trailblazer"" but is also often referred to as a ""token"" of a certain gender or race. But either way, the role was to publicly present the diversity of the company. And as I understood it, that was a part of my role, as mandated by management. To assist them in recruiting other women. 

I said I was asked about my experience by a potential applicant, and I answered in what I felt was a honest way. Saying

- There are two women here

- I feel that on top of a technical role, my role here as a woman is to be a trailblazer or token for other women. 

- If that dual role appeals to you, this would be a good fit. If a purely technical role appeals to you, this may not be a good fit. 

I see this as similar to how other recruiters say ""this is a very fast paced role, if you enjoy that role you would be a good fit but if you do not, you may not be."" And I was wondering why I had been called to meet when other employees who had described the role and the sort of person they want to fill the role, have not been. 

The HR guy said that ""token"" was often seen as having a negative connotation and I was deterring applicants

I said that ""fast paced"" is also seen as negative to people with outside obligations, for example. And I didn't understand why being frank about the nature of my role was a problem. In fact, recruiters are often encouraged to be frank to attract candidates who are genuinely good matches. It would help attract the sort of woman who would like to be a ""token female engineer"" and deter the type of woman who would not. 

My manager got frustrated and raised his voice to say ""NOBODY WANTS TO BE A TOKEN!"" And honestly I just looked at him with a ""no shit"" face but said ""That doesn't really track with your previous comments, you've frequently said that I should be proud to represent the company, and that I am much needed at these events. It sounded like you see it as an admirable and much appreciated role."" 

He said I was being ""a smartass"" and I said ""I apologize but I'm frustrated by a number of the contradictions in the messaging around this role. That I should be frank about the job expectations to recruit good fitting candidates, however I should not be frank about my personal job expectations? Despite never having that been communicated to me? 

Hearing that I should be proud and happy to represent the company as a female engineer to attract other women? But then hearing that nobody wants to be in my shoes and that if I describe my role I will deter applicants? 

To hear that the company is making efforts towards diversity, however that effort doesn't seem to continue to retention, as this year, four female employees quit, two were hired and then rapidly quit... This is a retention rate far lower than average. 

I'm frankly confused by what my role in this company is. Do you want an engineer or do you want a token? 

My manager snapped at me and said that I am an engineer. I said ""I would like my job duties to reflect that"" 

The HR guy said that I wouldn't be permitted to publicly represent the company anymore. I said okay. (Very not mad at that...)

So... I feel like my manager is pissed off, but I'm well along in the interview process with several other companies. So hopefully that won't be a problem anymore.

AITA for kicking my sister out of my house after she defender her step-son?,"I saw a similar post a few hours ago and wanted to ask

My(22f) sister (28F) married a man twice her age (50M), she was ''the other woman'' for 2 years and got pregnant with my nephew (1year male). His husband ex-wife obviously kicked him out and his oldest (20M) followed.

I took them in 10 months ago after his wife won the house in their divorce, they asked to stay for 1 to 2 years unlit they're able to buy their own house, I said yes because I honestly didn't mind, I love my nephew with all my heart and my home (the family home, my dad left it to me) is quite big.

Things were okay, my sister's husband always paid rent on time, his son was actually helpful around the house and as I said, I love my nephew, so I was happy to have him and my sister around. For some context, I'm a sex worker (OF and in real life), my sister knows about it, never commented on it, but until recently I didn't think her family did until this happened. 

My sister's step-son whom I'll call Aaron always had a mess in his room and it was okay, it's his space, but I didn't like it when I noticed he started to leave food and drinks around, I don't want rats or cockroaches in my house so I asked him a bunch of times*, gently*, to please clean his room because it was unsanitary and we live with a baby. He was always like ''yeah, yeah'', his dad and my sister asked him too until we (he and I) fought about it and I said that if his room wasn't clean before sunday, I was gonna do it myself and throw away everything I find in the floor, he didn't believed me and neither did he clean. 

So I did it. I hired someone and asked her to throw everything away but to separate clothes in a bag and food in other, when he came back and saw his room he got so so angry, he said I had no right, that those were his things, that I throw away like 60% of his clothes and blabla, then he threatened to tell everyone that I was ''a whore'', I was taken aback and asked what he meant and he said that he found out what I did and that he was gonna get a video (dunno how) and send it to my family because I was a bitch and ''that's how you teach a bitch how to behave''. He said that his room was cleaner than me when it was all fucked up and dirty. 

Needles to say, I kicked him out and when my sister defended him and implied that I brought this on myself, I kicked all of them too. They had to crash a few couches until her husband got an apt and she's claiming and telling everyone that I was an AH

"AITA for not sharing any family news with my son growing up because he'd tell my ex everything, resulting in legal issues?","My son grew up living with both my ex-wife and myself. 

My ex is extremely high conflict and due to her job as a lawyer, used the courts to inflict as much damage on my life as she could. Which I never did understand because she pushed for the divorce and claimed to have lost feelings for me.

So naturally, I avoided sharing any details with her and usually gave one word text replies for things involving our son.

This worked until my son turned 11 and I found out that my son was telling my ex everything he was hearing in our home, even recording videos and sending them to her.

This continued even after therapy with my son and explaining to him how damaging over-sharing was. 

After wasting thousands of dollars for a pointless legal fight that was started purely because of my son's spying, my wife and I made the decision to no longer share any information with him that could potentially cause issues. The therapist had suggested this approach.

And unfortunately, this meant we kept all news of any promotions, vacation plans and extended family issues from my son. He only found out about trips while he was on the way to them. This continued until my son turned 19 and my ex remarried, removing me from her focus.

My son is now 20 and has found out that we purposely did this for most of his childhood and he is furious.

He says we treated him as an outsider. I apologized profusely, as did my wife. We tried to explain why we did what we did but he is refusing to give me a chance to resolve this.

He's gone on a tirade to my parents and siblings and called me a negligent parent.

He also told my ex. And my ex is now suing me for something completely unrelated and that has no standing but I'll be wasting thousands on a lawyer anyway. Which is what she wants.

AITA?",15695,v2hama,"I understand your situation. My partner's ex is just like yours. We actively do not share things with his youngest son either. Although in our case, he doesn't know yet that we are omitting information.

Your kids reaction has nothing to do with the issue he's complaining about. Like everything else involving parental alienation, it's all about the unconscious undercurrent.

His reaction is part of the alienation. He has been trained to see you as a problem. He doesn't have much of a concept of a good enough parent. That's part of the black and white thinking that people like your ex instill due to their emotional immaturity.

My advice to you is to stop defending. Just tell him you're sorry that he's angry and that it must be tough.

This reaction and everything about this situation is not going to change until he figures out who his mom is. And that is probably not going to happen with you anyway, it will happen with a therapist or just through life experience, or not at all unfortunately.",211,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v2hama/aita_for_not_sharing_any_family_news_with_my_son/
AITA For Deciding Not To Let My Husband Into The Delivery Room?,"I (29F) and my husband (30M) have been together for 8 years. I am now 8 months pregnant, almost 9 with a girl. In my husband's family, there is a tradition of naming a baby before it is born. The name is embroidered onto a blanket that has been passed down from generation to generation, and the baby is wrapped in the blanket when it is born. I'm trying to come up with a name we both like, but some of the names he suggests do not resonate with me.

My husband has been getting annoyed with me lately and telling me to just pick a name for the baby. As his grandmother's name was Beatrice, he wants to name her that, but I just don't like it. I wanted to have a list of names so that when I see her I can name her after what I think is appropriate. Although it can sound odd, I wanted to see her before naming her but have decided not to so that he can please his family.

In honour of my late sister, I want to name her Jessica. That was her name before she passed away from a heart attack. It means a lot to me, but I hadn't told him that particular name because I didn't want to hear any insults about it. Every time I suggest a name he'll attack it, calling it ugly in a variety of ways.

Today his mother was pressuring me to suggest a name, and I just blurted out the name Jessica. After a pause and a laugh, she said it was a name for a large girl, and it was a very unsuitable name. She went on to ask me if I wanted the baby to be ugly and if I was trying to ruin its life before it was even born. Initially, I was overwhelmed with anger and asked her to stop talking, more harshly than I should of, as she didn't have the right to imply others are ugly when she herself is no Beyonce.

Annoyed, she told me to leave her house. Not wanting to cause a further argument I left, and when I returned home my husband explained to me that he was extremely disappointed in my actions and that he couldn’t look at me.

As he is close with his sister, he struggled with his frustrations with her, which she then did to her mother. The next day she was at my doorstep and told me that she decided on a name. and then said my decor was tacky, She said she was naming the baby Connie, after her mother. It was a name neither I nor my husband picked, and wouldn’t cause an argument between us. I told her no and asked her to leave and eventually, she did, but not after some insults were issued to me.

I asked my hubby about it, and he said I have no right to speak about any of this, as I also have not been open to the names that he suggests. He then said that I was incredibly selfish, and said I should go.

I packed my things, then went to my older sister's house. She was fuming at my husband, and how they insulted our younger sister's name.

He's been trying to contact me for a few days now, apologising, but I don't want to speak to him.

I’ve also decided that I’m not telling his family when I go into labour, and if I must I am not allowing them anywhere near me while I’m birthing the child.

AITA for saying that it is fucking weird that my ex wife's newborn has my last name?,"I was married to my ex for 7 years until we divorced and went our separate ways 4 years ago. After the divorce she kept my surname. I didn't necessarily like it because it felt like she was still attaching herself to my family but I could understand the practical reasons enough not to let it bother me. She recently gave birth to a baby and posted a picture of said child and revealed its name. A friend sent it to me commenting about the surname and asking if I knocked her up. Following that four more people directly contacted me either congratulating me or asking for confirmation whether it's my child or not and my mother says she's been catching whispers about it too at church. I bumped in to her and her sister in town and obviously congratulated her then asked about the kids name. She said the name. I asked about the surname and she confirmed that the child's legal surname is 'obviously' xyz [mine] and asked if there was a problem. Now that pissed me off. My surname is very unique especially in the area since my family is not originally from her so when people hear the surname they naturally think of my family and assume that this is my kid and it fucking isn't. Worse the father is apparently in the picture so I don't know what the fuck is going on there.

I straight up said that it was fucking weird that she's giving her newborn the surname of the man she's divorced from who isn't in any way linked to the kid and sounds almost obsessive. She said she gave her daughter her surname as the mother and not mine. Am I the asshole?

Edit: I have no children with her. She has one other child apart from this one who has her previous. Saw this being asked in the comments so there's that answer.

Also her surname doesn't impact her professionally.

I do not know why the father's surname wasn't used.",15693,wafrdc,"NAH.

I get that it might feel weird for you.

But it's not like she chose your personal last name from all the potential last names in the world. She did NOT name her baby after you. She gave her baby her own last name, which is standard practice. 

Why didn't she change her name after the divorce? Name changes are frustrating AF. There's a ton of paperwork and all of the gazillion accounts she has would need to be updated, and some do not allow changes at all. Especially since you guys were married for years.

Why didn't she give the baby the father's last name? She could have, but having a different last name from your kid can be logistically difficult. And if their relationship is at all shaky, she would want the kid with her own name.

I get that it feels weird to you. But none of this is about you. It's about her making things easier for herself and her baby.",5933,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wafrdc/aita_for_saying_that_it_is_fucking_weird_that_my/
"AITA for letting my son call my best friend ""Dad""?","Update [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wuw9se/update_aita_for_letting_my_son_call_my_best/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

My (30M) relationship with my wife Sam (29F) has been rocky since our son Oliver was born two years ago. She got pregnant just a few months after we got married and things were fine up until Oliver’s delivery. I assume it was postpartum depression, Sam never sought out a specific diagnosis, but after he was born it was like she just couldn’t care less about our child. We hadn’t planned to have children so early into our marriage and it was scary, but I can’t describe to you the all-encompassing love that comes with being a parent. The fear was worth it for me. It still is and always will be.

Throughout Oliver’s life, but especially that first year, I was essentially acting as a single parent. The only help I had (and I don’t mean for that to sound diminishing because this man is a godsend) was my best friend, Matt (33M). The plan was for Oliver to be breastfed, but my wife had no interested in it after he was born. I was the one changing diapers and mixing up formula for bottles and being in the house we shared felt so... oppressive. Like the joys of bonding with my son were being sucked out of me because of the energy there. So I would take Oliver to Matt’s. 

I don’t want to ramble on for too long, but there have been exactly zero times in life where Matt hasn’t shown up for me. I’ve known him since I was 19 and can safely say that even after all that time. But this is the most wonderful thing he’s given me. I could sleep soundly knowing my baby would be taken care of. I had a place of refuge. He is so, so good with Oliver and is my shoulder to cry on. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to repay him but I’m definitely trying every single day. 

Things with my wife have kind of started to look up but recent events have sent us in a huge downwards spiral. Oliver was having some speech delays but he’s been really picking things up as his third birthday nears. He’s babbled “dadada” towards Matt and I for a while now, but “daddy” has since been added to his vocabulary and that is used to refer to us both. I have never corrected him. I checked in with Matt to make sure he was fine, and he said he was honored to be bestowed with such a title.  

Sam got to hear this recently when I was on facetime with Matt and she basically went ballistic. As much as I hate to admit it, I did say he was more of a parent than she had been which, while true, is hurtful. I need outside opinions on this.

Aita for allowing him to call him dad?",15669,wqblak,"YTA.  As others pointed out, you've been neglectful of your wife's depression, and instead of dealing with it, you've overly relied on another person for your support, to the point that your relationship is suffering.  And you've neglected your child's relationship with his mother, allowing another to colonize what should be a prime family position. 

Letting your child call your friend ""daddy"" is not normal.  You're encouraging your child to treat him as a parent, which is a role your wife should be taking (would that she was healthier).  A more traditional way to refer to him would be ""Uncle Matt"", making him an honorary member of the family, but clearly not his parent.",811,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wqblak/aita_for_letting_my_son_call_my_best_friend_dad/
AITA for telling my SIL that she upstaged me at my wedding?,"I (30F) recently got married to Matt (30). Matt has a stepsister, Tiffany (28F). I have met her less than 10 times in the five years I dated Matt as she doesn't live nearby and is not close to my husband. However, she was invited to our wedding.

I should mention that Tiffany is very attractive. She is pretty, with a currently fashionable body type, she also dresses well and spends money on her appearance. This is well known and even though I've only met her a few times whenever she is brought up by my in laws she always mentioned as being very invested in her image. I don't begrudge her this at all.

The ceremony went fine, but afterwards, while my in laws were congratulating me, my FIL commented that I looked beautiful, and in the next breath mentioned Tiffany did, too. His wife caught his eye and shook her head, but I ignored it. When Tiffany came over to say congratulations, she looked stunning. Her dress was beautiful and fitted her perfectly, her hair and make up looked like they'd been done professionally, and she was wearing a pair of obviously designer shoes. Her outfit was totally appropriate for the event, but I was still weirdly upset by how she looked and immediately felt self conscious next to her. Even Matt told her she looked great, and they rarely talk. For the rest of the night, every single male guest at the wedding asked about Tiffany, who she was, how I know her, if she was single, etc. By the speeches, I was fed up and almost in tears, and even the best man mentioned her in his speech off the cuff. I let it go, went on my honeymoon, and tried to forget the whole thing.

We came back about a week ago, and this past weekend had dinner with my in laws. Tiffany was visiting, and we learned that she had got engaged. She showed us her comically large ring and said she was planning to have the wedding next year and that it would be a black tie event. Before I could stop myself, I jokingly said that I was pretty sure I'd already been to her wedding, I was the one in the white dress. She asked what I meant, and I thought there was no point in lying so I just admitted I felt she upstaged me at my wedding. She laughed and said you can't upstage a bride. I asked if I could wear white to her wedding then and she shrugged and said 'if you think it'll help'. She then apologised if I felt her outfit was inappropriate. My in laws moved the conversation on and we went on with dinner.

When we got home my husband blew up on me, saying I embarrassed him by being petty and jealous of Tiffany. He said he doesn't even like her but even he knows she can't do anything about what she looks like or the clothes she can afford, and I made myself look bitter and childish, and him by association. I admit it wasn't my best moment, but I thought he would at least understand how I felt given that he heard everyone's comments that night. He's demanding I apologise to Tiffany and his parents but I don't think I said anything that heinous.

My boyfriend's mother does not agree. She is no longer speaking to me. I am not allowed to see my boyfriend, who I guess is no longer my boyfriend and hasn't been for 2 years. I knew this would happen so I said goodbye to him before I told her. I do not want to repeat what she said to me, however it was awful. She says I ruined Christmas because I made the decision on the 23rd but she knew this was possible and it was a time sensitive offer. As one commenter said, it was never going to be a good time to do this.

On the plus side, her hating me has made it so that I have to leave for this job. I have no ties here anymore.

I may be the asshole in her eyes but this is what I need. I am having fleeting moments of regret but my family and therapist have said that in the 5 days since making this decision, I seem lighter.

I am excited for this new chapter, thank you again for the kind comments.",15647,zxs6sz,"You did the right thing. She is lashing out, not because of what you did, but because of how unfair life is. Whether you choose to forgive or not, she will need more time.

AITA for insisting my niece is co-flower girl with my fiancé’s niece?,"My fiancé and I are planning our wedding. She comes from a large family. She has 5 sisters, most of them have kids. 4 of her sisters are her bridesmaids, one is serving as maid of honor. I come from a smaller family: just my parents, my sister and my niece, Brynn. Brynn is 3 years old and pretty much my best pal. I’m her godfather,I love her to bits. 

I didn’t care when my fiancé didn’t choose my sister to be a bridesmaid and likewise my sister was cool with it. I did feel some sort of way because I have all 4 of my fiancé’s brother-in-laws in my wedding party (at fiancé’s request) but ultimately, it’s her side of the party, she can do what she wants. 

Then it came time to pick the younger roles in the wedding. Her older nephews are junior groomsmen, the younger is the ring bearer. She only has one niece, Aubrey, who’s 4. My fiancé wants her to be the flower girl. I said that’s fine, but I also want Brynn to be one. They can walk down the aisle together, it’d be super cute. Brynn loves playing with Aubrey,  so they get along.

My fiancé says she wants our wedding to be “traditional” so there can only be one flower girl. I suggested Brynn could hold a sign or something while Aubrey threw flowers. My fiancé said no, she can sit with my sister and parents.

At this point, I insisted and said Brynn would be flower girl. I texted my sister and asked, she agreed. My fiancé got pissed and I  said it’s my day too, Brynn means a great deal to me and she’ll be in the wedding. My fiancée and Aubrey’s mom  are mad at me, saying I’m stealing Aubrey’s spotlight. AITA?

Update: Okay, wow. Did not expect this to blow up the way it did. Thank you to everyone who reached out.

This morning, my fiancé and I sat down to talk about the wedding in general. I brought up Brynn and Aubrey. My fiancé just kept parroting “it’s tradition, let Aubrey have the spotlight”. She shot down compromise after compromise (Aubrey walks first, Brynn blows bubbles or holds a sign, etc). Finally, my fiancé was honest. She doesn’t want Brynn in our wedding because Brynn has Down Syndrome. She said everyone will be looking at her, taking pity, etc. Turns out it wasn’t about a  spotlight on Aubrey, but my fucking fiancé. I told her to fuck herself, called her ableist and said don’t worry, there won’t be a spotlight to steal anymore because there’s no wedding. 

I’ve left our apartment, staying at my sister’s and playing with Brynn. My phone has been blowing up with texts and calls from my fiancé. Magically she’s ready to compromise now. I need time but am likely done. Y’all were right.",15639,wtr404,aubrey’s spotlight ?,454,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wtr404/aita_for_insisting_my_niece_is_coflower_girl_with/
AITA for making my son walk the dog?,"Throwaway account and fake names because my wife is also on Reddit. And sorry for the long post. 

My wife (39F) and I (42M) have three sons, Alex (15), Dylan (11), and Jake (8). When I was a kid I always wanted a dog but my parents said no. I never got the chance to get one during my twenties but recently my interest in owning one was sparked again so I asked my family what they thought about getting a dog. My wife wasn’t enthusiastic about it but she relented after a few weeks of me asking. Alex and Jake were excited to get one but Dylan was immediately opposed to the idea. 

Dylan was always different than my other sons, he never had an interest in sports and was always more subdued than his brothers which has always made it hard for me to connect with him. 

He remained opposed to the idea of getting a dog but me and my other sons managed to wear him down until he finally relented. However, he said that if we did get a dog, he wasn’t going to be interacting with it or taking care of it, that would be completely on me and his brothers. I found this ridiculous but i agreed in the moment hoping he would change his mind after meeting the dog. 

The problem is he hasn’t changed his mind yet. We’ve had Zeus for seven months now and Dylan has not warmed up to him in the slightest. 

He doesn’t play with the dog, he doesn’t cuddle with him, he doesn’t let Zeus into his room because he “destroys stuff” and whenever he is near the dog he just ignores him. I find this completely ridiculous. Zeus loves Dylan, he follows him around whenever he sees him and jumps on him to get his attention and play but Dylan just isn’t receptive to it.

To change this, I told Dylan last week that he would be in charge of walking the dog every day after school. Dylan straight up refused and has shut down the conversation every time I bring it up. It’s been a week and he hasn’t walked the dog once. 

In my frustration, I told him that if he didn’t start listening then I wouldn’t allow him to go to the comic book store anymore and he freaked and told my wife. Now, my wife is upset with me, claiming that I knew what I was getting into with this and I knew that Dylan wouldn’t be playing with the dog but his intolerance of the dog is weird and I refuse to entertain it any longer. 

My wife has been short with me ever since that conversation and Dylan is cold with me as well. Alex is now agreeing with his mother which is making me have second thoughts. So Reddit, AITA?",15605,y0mcij,"YTA. Full stop.

Dylan told you he didn’t want to take care of or interact with the dog and you agreed. Now you’re threatening to take away something he likes doing because…he doesn’t interact with the dog?

AITA for packing my dad's lunch but not my BIL and refusing when demanding to?,"My (17F)parents have been remodeling the house, my dad tore a big chunk in the back and he, my brother (19M) and my sister's husband (27M) have been cleaning and picking the rubbish that was left.

Is important to say that I do not like my BIL at all, he's quite misogynistic, disrespectful and has no boundaries. I know how badly this speaks of my family, but my brother and father are nothing like that and they too believe that he's awfully wrong, here is so much we can do when my sister claims she's happy with this. I try to interact as less as I can with him, and I feel uncomfortable in his presence because until a few years ago he used to made fun of me for anything I did. He's also used to have my sister or my mom do things for him like cooking, serving him his own plate, laundry, childcaring, anything.

That being said, my father and my BIL usually leaves at the same hour to work (My dad works in construction and BIL at a company), I've been doing my dad's lunch for two years now since I got a liking to cooking, I cook dinner for all of us and I only pack some for him, for example, during this instance, I made enchiladas so I packed him a few, with a side of lettuce, sour cream and green salsa in small containers, a bag of chips and a few chunks of sliced fruit (apple and pear), I also pack him a water and coke.

When they came to the kitchen (with my mom) I told my dad that his lunch was already in his car so he could eat something and leave without worrying, and my BIL said ''what about me?''. I just shrugged my shoulders and said that I left him a container in the island and he was more than welcome to pack his own stuff, that there were waters and cokes in the fridge.

He gave me a dirty look and asked why I didn't do it for him and I said ''You're not my dad so...'', my mom got in the middle and told me to start pack my BIL's lunch and he *smirked* when she said that, but I just sat with my plate and said no, that he could pack his own lunch or buy something at his job, my mom said that I was *embarrassing* her but my dad cut all for this when he told my BIL to stop fighting and pack his own stuff because I already cooked for all of us.

He ended up saying he would eat something at work and left early, my mom tried to berate me, but my dad cut her out and said that my BIL is already an adult, she said ''but she packs your lunch'' and my dad said ''yeah, but I don't demand it''. When he left my mom called me an AH and that she raised me better.

AITA for kicking a girl I didn’t know out of my wedding.,"My husband and I (both 27) got married a few weeks ago and he obviously is still upset about it but I don’t think I was wrong so I thought I would ask here.

We only gave plus ones to married couples or if we knew the SO well. My husband has one childhood friend that was coming from out of state to attend. I’ve met him a bunch but only his girlfriend of three years a few times because of the distance. 

I didn’t want to give him a plus one but my husband begged since he was traveling and didn’t know anyone else at the wedding and he didn’t want him to be uncomfortable or have to travel alone. I said fine just to make him happy. 

Flash forward to the reception I see him with some girl I have never seen before. I asked husband what was up and he told me that his friend and his gf broke up a few days before the wedding and since he already rsvped as 2 he brought a friend with him. 

I was pissed since I made an exception for him and I didn’t want anyone random at my wedding. I had one of my bridesmaid go to him and tell him he could stay but can his date please go back to the hotel this is a private event. 

He said ok and didn’t make a fuss but he left with her and didn’t come back. I though on everything was fine and had a great night. 

My husband found out about it the next day and we got in an argument. He’s mad because his friend traveled and I kick him out without talking to him. I didn’t kick him out just his date. 

Now it’s a few weeks later my husband still brings it up from time to time and his friend hasn’t been answering his texts. I kind of feel bad but it was my wedding and I didn’t want any strangers there.",15572,yui1p4,"YTA

Your husbands childhood friend traveled  for your wedding to celebrate you, days after his long term gf and him broke up. He (understandably) didn’t want to travel alone, or be at a wedding alone where he knew NO ONE.

You gave him a plus one, and had paid for the ‘head’ already. So he brought his ALLOWED plus one.

Then, you decide to throw her (and by extension him) out of your wedding for NO REASON. 

Because, unless your wedding was like 10 people, and your hate of having a +1 you didn’t know there was more important to you than your husband having his childhood friend there, I don’t understand how him having a date at a wedding where he knew nobody was so offensive to you that you couldn’t bear having her exist in the same space as you.

You need to offer your husband a massive apology. You also need to call his friend and offer him a massive apology for being such an asshole. If this is how you’re going to act for the rest of your marriage, it’s going to be short-lived.",7472,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yui1p4/aita_for_kicking_a_girl_i_didnt_know_out_of_my/
AITA for telling my husband I’d rather nobody use my holiday booking out of spite?,"My (23F) husband (27M) and I have been together for 5 years, married for 3.

We’re both athletic people, or at least I used to be, so we’ve been planning a holiday for the past year, without going into major details it’s an expensive (by my standards) holiday and it would’ve involved a lot of hiking, I was looking forward to it.

I was in an accident recently and, once again without going into much detail as it’s triggering, lost my leg. It’s upsetting but I’m not in a place to openly speak about it outside of therapy, obviously due to this recent…restriction, I’m unable to do what we’d planned for our holiday.

I hadn’t thought about the holiday, it’s non refundable…I had expected my husband to not want to go, currently his family haven’t asked once now I am and my family claim it’s “hard” to be around me because they “don’t know how to support me” whatever.

He said yesterday he invited his sister (19) in my place, I was baffled because I expected him to support me - he said it’s not for two months, I’m like so? Cancel and something we can both do, he said he needs a break - that he’s been supporting me, he deserves this and he was also looking forward to it…

So I said “you go, but I paid for my spot so no she can’t use it”

He asked if I’m being serious that it’s spiteful, his sister hasn’t done anything…I said she hasn’t asked me once how I’m doing, she texted me last week for £150 why should she get a free holiday?

Anyway, he’s upset claiming “he’ll still go and pay for his sister” which he won’t, since a) it’s expensive and b) last I checked fully booked

AITA for changing my wifi password and not sharing it with the neighbor?," I (23F) live next door to Jenny (she lives with her husband and 1 child) 

I work almost all day outside and in my spare time I play games on ps4 during the week. I pay for a good internet, because I like not having any lag while playing or any internet slowness. My ps4 is in my room and the internet router is in the living room, so it's wi-fi and not cable. And because of that, I constantly check the internet speed and it's always X. 


A few months ago, I invited Jenny's family over for dinner and gave them my wifi password, apparently theirs was weak at my house and I went through politeness. 

Last month, I started to notice very bad internet speed (1/10th of before) and a few technical visits to resolve until the technician asked if I had passed the password to someone in the building and I put the pieces together. 

I then changed the password, because the internet was crap and I didn't want to share it with 3 more people. 

Last week, the neighbor knocked on the door and asked for my wi-fi password, because her internet wasn't working and I commented saying that I changed it because there were people from other apartments using it. 

She got the message and said she was having a hard time and couldn't pay for her own internet, so in desperation she used mine and if I couldn't give her the new password, promising that they would only use it at night (when they got home from work) 

I denied saying that night was my leisure time too and that I didn't want to have bad internet and I don't want to pay more for the internet to be good for 4 people. And even more so for her using it for a month without my permission. 

She stomped off and, oh gosh, my new image in the building is of the petty bitch who doesn't want to share Wi-Fi with people who are struggling financially.

AITA for giving my Wedding Photographer a bad review?,"TA account.


I got married two months ago, was a moderate affair, open bar, nice dress, no kids at a slightly more upscale place than I would have liked but I guess you only live once.


We hired a photographer through a company, a midsized place that assigned you an employee. We met with her a few times to go over expectations, venues, etc. No red flags, nothing weird.


Day of the wedding she shows up in a sheer white blouse with lace, completely see through, with no bra. I noticed, my husband noticed, everyone noticed. I, and most of my guests, just spent the evening trying  to look away. All through the reception I could overhear people talking about it or joking about it. My husband and I had a good laugh about it after everything was done, just sort of a ""wtf was that, did that really happen?"". I guess every wedding needs a weird story, at least mine didn't involve a guest.


Couple of weeks ago we got the photo package, it was good and in line with what we paid for. 2 days later I get one of those automatic emails for a survey asking how they did. Overall I rated them well and even rated the photographer well except for the professional category, I gave a 3 (out of 5) and in the box filled in that I felt her clothing could be more professional. A manager called me for more clarity, I explained the outfit and said it wasn't a big deal but wasn't really situationally appropriate. Manager didn't say much but sounded serious and thanked me for informing them. 


End of story right? Well nope. On the weekend photographer girl shows up drunk on my lawn wearing three bras and starts screaming at my house. Long story short she was let go from her job and felt I was the AH to blame. Eventually we had to call the police to have her removed.

I work full time and my girlfriend used to stay home and take care of everything else (I still help out here and there) yet she would complain about the kids causing constant messes, not receiving proper descipline, accidents like breaking a vase and the list goes on. She complained that she is more of a parent than I am which's not true since I provide an income. yet she decided she wanted to go back to work and started looking.


She found a potential job and her interview was yesterday. I called her to remind her to pick the kids up from school since she's responsible for it but she said she was about to start her interview and told me to go get them. I was stunned, I told her I couldn't because I was at work. She said I could take a break but I refused because this would've affected my job. I asked if she'd take 10 minutes to quickly go pick them up but she refused. We ended up getting into an argument and me telling her she should've figured something out beforehand. She blew up saying that I'm the parent and that she was tired of being at my beck and call all the time. The kids ended up being picked up by my friend 40 minutes later which made them upset.


At home, I got into a huge argument with my girlfriend calling her selfish for doing this to the kids and ditching them like that.

AITA for telling my dad that I don't want him walking my cousin down the aisle?,"My (16F) cousin (23F) is getting married in november, she's the only daughter of my dad's brother. For some context, we don't get along at all, she bullied me while growing up and after my uncle passed away she tried to ''steal'' my dad, he never allowed it and made time for both of us but to this day my cousin still says that I was a bitch for not letting her have a paternal figure, which is not true. 

Neither my mom or dad allowed her to mistreat me and abuse me, but there's so much a parent can do, she used to do it while they weren't watching too and I was too afraid to tell them because I could see how important was for my dad to have a relationship with her, so I kept quiet. 

While the bullying decreased it never went away, she still makes fun of me; because I'm single, because I'm dumb, etc etc. When she got engaged she excluded me from the bridal party and it wouldn't matter if it wasn't for the fact that she included the rest of the family (her mom's side and my brothers) , my dad found this suspicious and things got a lot worse with her ''funny comments'': That I'll probably attend alone, that she didn't think the bridesmaid dress would be ''flattering'' to me because of my size, etc. She took my parents to dinner last week and asked my dad to walk her down the aisle and I don't know what excuse he gave her but after that, he came to my room and asked me if I would be okay with this. 

I was honest, I said no. I told him that she made most of my life hell, even before my uncle passed away and since I was his only daughter, I thought it would be an experience between us, that I knew she would ask and I only wanted to make my feelings clear BUT that at the end of the day, the decision was HIS and I'll accept whatever he decides because I know how important she is for him. He told me that he loved her as a daughter too and that was it. 

Well my dad told her no and now my cousin is blaming me, telling everyone that I forced him, that I was a jealous little b and that if I don't fix it then I wouldn't be welcome at her wedding. My mom and my aunt sided with her that it was a low blow from my part and most of her family is saying that it wasn't fair. my mom called me yesterday and told me that it I should've lied because this was an important moment for her.

AITA for yelling at another parent during pickup?,"I tried to type this out without using the name, and it wasn't comprehensible. So if anyone I know sees this, no you didn't. Here's what happened.

My son's name is Robin. It's just those five letters. It's not a nickname. The mom of one of the kids in his class is convinced his name is Robert. She volunteers at pickup. I'll drive up and she'll go to get my son yelling ""Robert, Robert!""

Now, the first few weeks I brushed it off because learning the names of a bunch of different kids is hard. I would just tell her when she came back over with my son ""actually his name is Robin."" I've said this almost every single day for over a month now. Last week I saw her at a school function and went up and introduced myself and basically said ""I'm Robin's father. You might recognize me from pickup. By the way, his name isn't Robert.""

Her response confounded me. She said Robin is a girl's name (it's unisex, but it's way more common for boys, so what??) and not a good nickname for Robert, so she'll call him his real name instead. I tried to correct her, since Robin isn't a nickname, but she wandered away. The next time she walked up to my car I got annoyed and said ""I'm here for Robin. R O B I N."" She did it again.

On Friday, when she called my son Robert, I asked her what her problem was in a very loud voice. I shouted loud enough that a teacher ran over. The volunteer mom ran away, and I tried to explain. The teacher looked at me like I had three heads and said she would go get my son. I got an email later asking me to come in Monday for a meeting.

I don't know how to approach this. Should I apologize for yelling? Should I demand an apology for the constant disrespect? Should I ask the mom not be allowed to volunteer anymore (or at least not get my son)? I feel like I tried to be reasonable, but maybe I was too sensitive?

Small update: My wife did reach out to Charlie's mom on Facebook to ask if the weird pickup mom called Charlie by a different name as well. According to Charlie's mom, weird pickup mom calls Charlie Charlotte (and Charlie is her legal name, not that it matters). Charlie's mom is not a fan of this, but she assumed it was a mistake and didn't want to say anything because she knows pickup is hectic and confusing and there are a lot of kids with similar names. My wife shared my story, and Charlie's mom agreed to email me this information, so I could bring it up in the meeting if needed.

Charlie's mom also said she would reach out to some other parents with questions about weird pickup mom. A lot of these kids went to kindergarten together, but our son did not, so we don't know many of these parents very well yet. Charlie's mom was really nice and helpful, and she and my wife even set up a playdate for our kids. So, regardless of how the meeting turns out, one nice thing came of this?

Meeting & pickup: So, first of all, my wife came to the meeting with me which was hugely inconvenient for her, but I'm glad she was there, because she doesn't really tolerate BS. So, we got there, and the teacher and principal were there. My wife didn't really let them say anything until she'd gone over everything with weird pickup mom in relation to our son and also Charlie and potencially other kids. The principal was really surprised.

The principal said the teacher would talk to the other mom. I apologized for yelling, and we all shook hands. At pickup that day, weird pickup mom wouldn't look me in the eye. She didn't call Robin Robert or by his actual name. She was quiet the whole time. Sorry it's all so anticlimactic.",15518,xtnmk9,"NTA. You tried on too many occasions to correct her. The tipping point was when she gave her opinion about not liking the name Robin and blatantly told you she'd continue to call him something else. I'd have probably called the principal after that conversation. That is the piece I'd be sure everyone present at the meeting understands. No one has the right to call a child something other than their name. 

I'd most certainly ask that she not be allowed to have contact with your son. I'd also keep the composure during the meeting that YOUR SON is the victim, not the volunteer mom.

AITA for not stopping my work-out for someone to make a video?,"This is becoming more and more common at the surrounding gyms, which is really annoying and a reason I've changed gyms more than once this year alone. Working out is a pillar of my everyday life, and it has been for the past ten years, and I'm at the gym every day of the week.

Now, I don't go to the gym to talk to people, make friends or make funny videos. I go to train and go home. However, now with the new video trends, many folks want to record their exercises to post on social media. This is their business and not mine, they can do whatever they want, but I also don't think I need to stop doing my own work-out to accommodate them. 

Last night, I was doing squats on the smith machine. I work out with head-phones and didn't notice someone trying to get my attention. I suddenly felt a tap on my shoulder mid-squat, and only then I noticed a woman with a very annoyed expression. 

She barely allowed me to finish the movement to start talking, which was muffled due to headphones. Long story short, she was annoyed because I was training in the smith machine, as she wanted to record herself doing regular squats. However, she said the best spot was in front of that smith machine (there's more than one), and she didn't want me on the frame, so she wanted me to stop my series for her to record.

Now, usually, if someone comes to me with a good attitude and asks if it's ok for me to stop for a series or two for them to record or even move machines, I would absolutely not mind and comply. That woman did nothing of the sort, being extremely arrogant and honestly, extremely annoying. 

So, I was petty, and told her to record once I was done, and proceeded to do every single exercise I could on the same smith machine. Squats? Smith. Hip Thrust? Smith. It was petty, and I know I shouldn't have done it. But I felt very vindicated, seeing her annoying expression. 

That being said, a few people said I was an asshole for doing that, as there were other machines I could use. Honestly, they might be right, but hey, I thought I'd ask the internet, was I too much of an asshole here?",15520,uxgb22,"NTA.

AITA for telling my dad that I still hold a grudge for something that happened 10 years ago?,"My (26F) mom passed away at childbirth, so it was pretty much my father (50M) and me, with the occasional visits from my grandparents (from both sides), since I lived with just him, I took on a more masculine style and likings, like ''one of the boys'' but the only boy was my father. I was Rexy (for T-rex, because I was obsessed with them for years), I had no barbies (he bought me a few but I was like ''ew), and I had almost 0 dresses or skirts, he also did my hair really awful every time. 

When I was around 12, he began dating this woman called Maria who had a daughter (15 at that time) named Stacy, while Maria was a total sweetheart, Stacy was horrible. She bullied me for not looking like ''a girl should do'', for liking ''man stuff'' like cars, bikes and stuff like that, I have to admit that I also didn't had many friends while growing up (neither female or males) so my person was my dad, and as I grew up I got involved with what he liked. To make things short, Stacy would often throw awful comments about me being a boy, a weirdo, etc and my dad would do these same comments in a less-bully way, but they hurt me more because he was confirming that while Stacy was ''his daughter'', I was his ''son''. What broke my heart was that he called Stacy ''Peach'' like Mario's princess while I was T-Rex. 

I did a 180° in my looks at 15, I brought dresses, skirts and dyed part of my hair a sweet pink which made Stacy laugh at me even more and my dad was like ''woa! Pink? that's for girls''. In my 16th birthday, Stacy put black dye in my shampoo and ruined my whole look, I guess it was the stick that broke the camel's back because I cried so horrible to the point of not breathing and I told my dad in front of Maria and Stacy what she had been done all of those years, along with my dad awful remarks and subtly enabling Stacy's awful comments. 

In the end, he left Maria and Stacy because it was obvious there was no going back for me after that, he eventually married my now step-mom when I turned 20. My dad apologized, we talked about it and a year after that we attended therapy until I was 24 I don't like to talk about it, I think it broke my relationship with my dad in away we will never be able to fix, I know he doesn't have my back. 

Yesterday, while talking he tried to joke about it and I said that I didn't want to remember it because I'll never forgive him for joining Stacy in her bullying, he said it couldn't be possible that I'm still holding a grudge, I say I am, and that I always will because he absolutely broke my heart and confidence, he tried to argue, but my step-mom said that he needed to let go because my feelings are my feelings. I still cry when I remember it, but he says I'm an AH because he left them and made amends with me.",15502,usv7b7,"NTA.

AITA for expecting my husband to pay for the tools my daughter used for the handmade necklace he threw out.,"


My husband and I have disagreements from time to time. Nothing major just normal stuff.

He has a habit of throwing out something of mine as a way to ""teach me a lesson"" whenever he's upset with me after an argument. This time he threw out the handmade necklace my daughter (13) made for me herself on mother's day. The argument was about him wanting to hang out with his buddies on the day of my mom's surgery (I wanted him to stay home and be with our daughter but he refused). Yesterday I found out he threw out the necklace and after he admitted to what he did, I went off on him and also told him that this necklace was special to me and that my daughter spent so much time and effort to make it. She comforted me then told me she'd make an identical one for me if I buy her the tools, I went to my husband and told him I was expecting H.I.M to cough up the money to pay for thr tools so my daughter could make me a similar necklace. He laughed and said that I was delusional to expect him to pay when I haven't even apologized for my ""part"" of the argument but I felt like I had nothing to apologize for and that yes, he should stay home for a family emergency. He said ""why don't you have one of your friends come stay with Chloe? Oh yes you don't have any!"" This pissed me off but he said he wouldn't pay but I told him that our daughter knew what he did which set him off saying I was trying to turn our daughter against him and brainwash her into thinking he's the bad guy in this scenario. 

I told him I'm still expecting him to pay but now he's saying that I'm ganging up on him with our daughter.",15479,urkgqd,">	He has a habit of throwing out something of mine as a way to “teach me a lesson” whenever he’s upset with me after an argument.

AITA for telling my husband's family and friends that he didn't buy the house but both of us did?,"

My husband M34, and I, F31 bought our first single story house few weeks ago. We both put money towards it and both our names are on the title.

Days ago we hosted dinner for his family (my family live in another state) and friends to celebrate this occasion. They brought gifts and took a tour around the house. we had an overall good time til dinner.

My husband suddenly started telling the story of how much he sacrifices, how many extra jobs he took and how many years he spent to save for and buy this house, completely ignoring my part of role in it. I was confused, I kept staring at him as he went on about how he found the house and how much trouble he got into to get it. His family and friends looked impressed as he kept saying ""my house this, my house that"". I said hold on, and told them that it's not his house, but our house because we both equally saved and conributed equally to be able to purchase it. His mom asked if I was serious and I offered to show her the legal document. My husband looked me shocked and got quiet while his friends and family kept looking at him. He then excused himself to the bathroom for 40 minutes. I had to say goodbye to the guests by myself.

He later blew up asking wth I just did, I said he shouldn't have lied to them in the first place. He asked "" what could you have possibly gained by saying what you said? What could you have possibly lost if you didn't?, do you ever think before you speak?"" I got mad and replied that he was dismissing my role in buying the house and I didn't like that. He was like ""oh so you decided to humiliate me infront of my family and friends to appear important? Pretenious much?"" I found this insulting but he argued I messed up and ruined his joy in the new home when I could've avoided it. I got tired of arguing so I went to sleep. He has gone radio silence the next day and has been acting upset for days now.",15478,tfimtb,"NTA.

AITA for expecting my gf to pay her share of the rent?,"My gf and I have been dating for a year and we want to move in together. We want a 2 bedroom 1 bath apartment or townhouse near my work. I’m a 2nd year pathology resident and my residency is 5 years long. She works from home and wants an office. She also makes 120k and I only make 68k. So our rent is $1800/month + utilities and she wants to go half on both rent and utilities so we would both pay roughly 1000 a month. 

Because she is using one of the rooms as her office I feel like she should pay more so I should pay $700 and she should pay $1300. She thinks even if she is using an extra room because living near the hospital is very expensive I should pay half because we could get a cheaper place if I don’t live near work. She thinks is because we are paying more to live near my work so I don’t have to pay for gas I should pay half for rent. I find she’s being selfish because she makes much more than mean, and once I complete my residency I can easily make $350k a year or more. 

But according to her it’s not fair for her to wait 3 years to “potentially get paid back” because we could breakup and she would have “subsidized” me. To me if she isn’t willing to pay a bit more to put some skin in the game she’s being a gold digger and waiting for me to make bank without giving anything in the first place.

AITA for being upset with my son for finding a job without telling me?,"
My son is 18, He is going to be attending community college and is living with me, my husband and his 2 younger half sisters.


The other day I found out that he found and accepted a job without telling me. I was upset with him about it and the reason for that is that first of all, he should've told me since we live in the same house and also, and more importantly now I'm left without someone to stay with the girls from 3 to 8 where my shift start-ends. my son is usually the one to stay home with the girls and his new job is during these hours so one way or another we are impacted.


He told me his friend found him this job and it just happened - but I don't think it did because he knew he had to give up staying with his sisters while I work. my husband travels most of the time (he's a pilot) and paid child care is a no for me. My son said I shouldn't be surprised by him trying to work to save money to be able to pay for himself but that is just absurd since he literally lives with us without having to pay for anything except for his own entertainment. He said he needed the job and he wasn't reallistically going to stay and watch his sisters for days on end especially he doesn't get paid for it. We kept arguing and my husband got involved and he too was upset saying that my son had no respect for us. my son basically had a ""like it or not"" attitude with us and kept refusing to discuss this wirh us saying we have no right to be upset with him and should just accept it. but I'm just...I think that he's being inconsiderate of my husband's and I's struggle to provide for the family as a whole. this should mean something to him but he acted selfishly.


ETA okay, it seems that I did not mention the reason why the babysitter option isn't ideal and is because my daughters don't want a babysitter. they're both dealing with some issues and are unconfortable being with a stranger at home. besides that my son decided to stay with them and we didn't ask him or anything.

ETA Okay, some of you here are implying or suggesting that I'm making my son to be the girls' babysitter but that is in fact not true. He doesn't do much for them, just stays home with them while he studies or plays video games. He adores his sisters and only stays with them when he wants to. otherwise we wouldn't force him. Also, my husband said the girls are too young for therapy and I agree with him on that.",15448,suz9lb,"> paid child care is a no for me.

"AITA for telling my cousin this isn't a grief competition and she should understand that, after she went off at me?","I had a miscarriage last year which was the worst moment of my life, and it took a big hit in our relationship. Me and my husband's divorce just got finalized last month and it's honestly a different type of pain, but I thankfully have wonderful friends and family who've been supporting me all the way.

We had Christmas dinner with family. A lot of my relatives kept checking in with me, asking if I was doing okay and bringing me food. I felt really loved and it was pretty fun overall, and took my mind off everything for a bit.

My cousin A's fiance recently passed. She was at dinner, but wasn't talking much and mostly kept to herself. I saw her getting soda, so I asked if she could bring me one as well.

That didn't go well. A got upset and started going off at me, why she should have to bring me things and I can get my own. I told her it's completely fine if she doesn't, I just asked since she was already there and she's making a big deal.

A looked like she was about to cry, and kept going off about how I expected everyone to ""fawn"" over me and no one cares about her and her fiance.

I told A we're all doing our best. I'm sorry if she feels that way but this isn't a grief competition, and she should understand that.

A few people overheard us, but the conversation changed and it wasn't a huge issue. A's sister messaged me later that what I said to A is ""awful"" and we're all awful to her.

I told my best friend what happened and she suggested I post on here for opinions. I didn't think this was such a big deal, but A thought otherwise.

AITA for refusing to tell the school why my daughter was absent?,"My daughter is in the 5th grade. Thursday night she got her first period and it freaked her out. She was sad she was getting older. She was up all night. Likely dealing with a lot of unfamiliar hormones. We ended up taking the next day off for a mental health day. 

I called the school and said we’d had a personal matter and she wouldn’t be in. She has a male teacher who she doesn’t really get on with so suffice it to say she wanted to keep this private. 

The next day her teacher stopped me after I dropped her off and kind of cornered me outside the building, blocking my path from leaving, which already grated on my nerves. 

He asked where my daughter had been the day prior. I said we’d had a personal matter at home and it was resolved now, thanked him for his concern, and said I really must be off to work now. 

He then said I *had* to tell him. Kind of leaning over me and dropping his voice an octave as though he were trying to lord over one of the kids. Wasn’t a fan of that either. I told him I didn’t *have* to do anything and if he continued to speak to me this way I might have to have a chat with the administrators. 

He said if I didn’t tell him then it would be an unexcused absence. You need something like five of those for it to matter and this would be my daughter’s first so I shrugged my shoulders. (Not to mention I could get it expunged at a higher level.)

Finally I said again I really couldn’t be late to work and I pushed past and left. He called after me that he couldn’t be expected to do his job if I left him out of the loop on things like keeping my child out of school. I told him he’d have to manage. 

When I got to the car I vented all this too my husband who felt maybe I’d been a bit too brash and that the teacher was coming from a place of genuine concern for my daughter. 

I now feel a bit badly and as though maybe I jumped to conclusions stonewalling him  the way I did. 

Am I the asshole?",15434,uano7j,"Yeah, no. That’s completely inappropriate of him and a totally unnecessary reaction. Does he do this every time any kid is absent at all?

WIBTA for going to my friend's un-wedding reception?,"My buddy Kalen was supposed to get married to his (ex?) fiancee Kayley next weekend. They were together like 4-5 years and seemed  like a perfect couple in love, happy, always doing sweet things for each other, etc. We always joked that they were relationship goals.

So everyone was shocked when Kayley called us last week frantically asking if we knew where Kalen was. He just didn't come home from work that day, no warning, no nothing. I don't know what all went down but  a couple of days ago Kayley makes a post that the wedding is off but there's still going to be an un-wedding party/reception because it's too late for to get most of the refunds. 

Immediately after, Kalen starts messaging all of us upset, asking if we're going. Apparently he was going through something but wanted to stay together, and Kayley broke up with him instead. Now he's devastated. He's furious that we're thinking of partying when that will be just a hard day for him and he needs support. Our friends are split.

The way I see it, I already took time off for the wedding, our our cabins are already booked and I don't know if we can get refunds, we already bought new clothes for the wedding, and we were looking forward to a romantic weekend away in the mountains. It sucks that Kalen is heartbroken, but he kind of brought it on himself. Plus, Kayley has upgraded the cash bar to an open bar.

But my  other friends think that since we're his friends first we should be there for him when he's going through a hard time even if it's his own dumbass fault, and that we'll be responsible if he harms himself while we're partying and drinking.

UPDATE: AITA for getting my aunt and uncle kicked out of their house for not letting my husband and I sleep together?,"Hey y’all. My husband and I wanna thank everyone for the overwhelming amount of support and love!

We have updates.

To people asking where my mom is in all of this. She’s now supportive of my husband & I’s relationship. She agrees that I gave aunt & uncle a chance to apologize and they didn’t.

I could tell my dad was not telling me the whole story about the eviction so I pressed my mom and found out the truth 3 days ago. I’ve been having a hard time with it.

The day I told him, my dad reached out to my aunt & uncle, and not only did they show no remorse, they said that they didn’t want their kids to be f*ggots because of us (yeah, they really said that). He asked why they would invite us to stay with them if this is how they truly felt. 

This is where is gets bad: to them, it’s one thing if we are living in Vermont being gay, it’s another thing if we visit my hometown “throwing our lifestyle in everyone’s faces” by shacking up at the motel. The local motel owner, whose family owns it and is a childhood friend of my mom’s, gossiped about us every time we were there. She was nice to our face but behind our backs, different story. Because everyone knows each other, we would become the talk of the town when we stayed there, and we had no idea. We wouldn’t have tolerated it if we had. We never stayed long for visits because we could sense something was off, but pushed the feeling aside because to our faces they were nice. These are people that know me, that claim to love me.

Mom said my aunt & uncle were trying to save face with the rest of the town, & try to control our behavior at the same time while we were there. Before evicting, my dad asked mom to reach out to this gossiping friend. According to the friend, A&U were a major part of the shit talking. NO ONE EVER SAID ANYTHING TO MY FACE. I feel so disgusted and betrayed and naive.

This enraged my dad so he decided to evict them. He told them that they can freeload somewhere else & he will never accept anyone as family that would treat his sons that way. Mom says he’s gone NC with them. 

Mom told me that he thinks of my brother, husband, & I as his pride and joy. I feel so proud that I have a dad like him. I mentioned that he is my hero — this is just the icing on the cake. He has always been my #1 supporter, and he told me when I came out as bi that he would always have my back. He kept that promise.

My dad doesn’t know he’s internet famous, I still don’t know how to break it to him lol. He’s a humble guy. Dad doesn’t use social media so we’re safe for now. My bro knows about this post and we’ve been trying to figure out a plan of action.

We’ve been contacted by journalists, we’ve gotten so many loving messages. But at the end of the day, I’m just an average guy still trying to process the fact that I got betrayed on a scale that I can’t even comprehend. For those saying we are AH for letting my cousins go homeless, I can confidently say now that they only have their parents to thank for that.",15414,xdokig,"Original post:

AITA Refusing to allow some kids a pony ride? ... All hell breaks loose,"Update : thank you to everyone. I'm so sorry I can't reply to you all, there's just too many!!! First point I do not hate kids. If I did I would want them hurt, I wish the exact opposite. Two, I have unblocked all the family and sent them a pretty long msg calmly explaining what had happened and what my concerns were. I also included a link to a child falling off a horse the size of mine, explaining I don't want any kid to face injury, disability,or death. The response has been very, very positive. Third, I have reached out to the family of the birthday girl and explained what happened. They were mortified as had no idea I hadn't given permission. I have set up a meet-the-horsey for this weekend, with the landowners permission. We're setting up an arena with temp fencing etc. She doesn't know it but there will also be two ponies from the hire place there for pony rides for her and her friends ;)

Long story short I(f43) have owned my horse for over 20years after rescuing her from a knackery as a 4 month old foal (story in itself). I keep her in a huge field 24/7 with other horses and she is the absolute apple of my eye. I don't mind people saying hi to her over the fence, we live in the suburbs so obviously it's going to happen. What I HATE is how my mother keeps offering her friends grandkids pony rides. Neither my horse or I are kid uh...people. I'm sick of showing up at the property to be met with a gaggle of kids expecting a pony ride. I've laid down the law and told mum no more. She EXPLODED at me but I've stayed firm. I spoke to the property owner because I worry mum will just show up and try to give the kids a pony ride without my supervision. He agreed it's a liability and has marked her as not allowed on the property without me there. Yesterday he called me saying she was there with 12 KIDS. 12! And going off her rocker because he wouldn't allow her on the property. I spoke to her on his phone and told her to bugger off and NEVER try this rubbish again. Since then I've had to block her and most of my family because omg the flying monkeys and screaming about how I'm over privledged, selfish, and a child hating monster...

AITA for telling my SIL to not buy the same shampoo as me and causing a scene at dinner?,"I feel like an insane person. I had to make a new Reddit here because I know my SIL follows me on Reddit.

My (32f) SIL (29f) is obssesed with me. I swear to god. We’ve known each other for 7 years when I started dating her brother and from the start I got weird vibes from her. She asks me where I got a certain piece of clothes or jewelry then buys the exact same ones. If I dye my hair, she dyes her hair THE SAME colour. If I post on Instagram about a certain restaurant, she will go there the next day or the same week. 

I got a new hair stylist and tagged her (quick edit, I meant I tagged the stylist NOT my sil) on Instagram, a few months later I visit her again she thanks me for sending her a new client (guess who that was). I posted a photo of my room a month ago, the next time I visit her place she had the SAME SHEETS. She says she had them for ages and it’s a coincidence. These kind of things happen all the time. Sometimes I’ll run into her at the grocery store and she’ll ask what I’m picking up and if I tell her she says “oh how funny me too!” And buy THE EXACT same thing as me. I’ve had people tell me they say her and thought she was me because we stress so similar and have the same hair.

I wish I didn’t have to see her but the kicker is our husbands are best friends/business partners, and they live 2 blocks away from us. I’ve brought this up to my husband since the start and we’ve both talked to her and she either denies and says it’s all coincidence or she just says she thinks I have such good taste that she can’t help it but promises she’ll stop and never does My husband realizes it’s frustrating but he ultimately says it’s harmless and she’s his sister so he can’t just cut her off for copying me.

The other day she asked me what shampoo I use and I refused to tell her because I knew she was just going to buy it, but she started crying and my husband just told me it’s not a big deal  so I told her after she assured me that she wasn’t going to buy it she was just curious because my hair is always so nice.

Yesterday we went over to their place for dinner and I used the washroom and decided to check my suspicions so I looked in the tub and saw she had bought the same shampoo!!!!

I was so frustrated that I brought it to the bottle to table and in front of our husbands told her that she is Not Allowed to buy the same shampoo as me and that this shit has got to stop or else i will cut her and her husband off regardless of what my husband says and i will never see them again! Obviously my husband said I embarrassed him and she started crying and we left. I may have over reacted but this situation is making me crazy!! My friends who know about this said i overreacted but it’s understandable because of the position im in constantly. My husband wants me to apologize to her but I do not want to!

ETA I forgot to mention something important.

AITA for having my (25F) uncle (56M) arrested?,"So I moved into my apartment (I own) back in 2020. I keep to a very minimalist lifestyle so I don't actually own very much at all, but what I do own, I like it to be a good investment for the long run (relevant for later).

I ran into a plumbing issue that wasn't easy to fix- at least not for me who knows 0 about plumbing. I called my uncle asking if he could help. 

He came over with my aunt to take a look at what was going on and... I don't like her. There are quite a few reasons, she took my grandmothers ring despite it being willed to me, she pushes over people to get what she wants. She uses her mother's death as an excuse, always leaving out that her father & she were, according to those who knew them then, exceptionally cruel to the mother. 

My uncle used to be really great until she came along, now he bends to her every whim. I digress. 

She comes and complains that it looks like I am dirt poor. That I have minimal funishings and that it looks ""uptight"". I say I'd rather make memories than have stuff and leave it there. 

Then she notices my silver box I keep my sterling flatware in. Now, this is just me, I spent a good year or so saving money to buy nice flatware. My reasoning was it will grow in value, I can pass it along to my children and it will, or can, last a long time. 

She starts asking me what's in it and I brush her off. She keeps on, as she does, and I say it's heirlooms (not true but still). She keeps on and on and I break saying it's flatware. 

She then asks me how many places settings and I say I can't remember. She goes on to say she has this ""small"" dinner party and can she borrow it and I say no. She pouts the rest of the time. 

They leave with my uncle saying he needs a few tools and a specific part to fix my plumbing and he will come back later. I thank him and say bye. 

We arrange for about a week later for him to come back with a key I left in the lockbox since I would be working. 

I come home. I look around. My damn silver box is missing and I know *EXACTLY* who it was. 

I call the police I give all the information and show them photos I took for insurance. Long story short my box was in their dining room when they showed up and my uncle is arrested for theft. 

My aunt keeps calling me screeching at me that I am horrible for this and going to hell for giving him a criminal record. I say she should have thought about that before she made him do that not being able to take no as an answer. The silver itself is a rarer pattern and not easily replaceable. She threw my comment back in my face saying ""I thought you wanted memories? It's just stuff"". I hung up on her. 

Here's where I think I am TA, my uncle only did it because of my aunt in my opinion. So I am effectively punishing someone who wouldn't have done it with out the influence. then I get mad all over again and think what a breach of trust it is and feel fine.

Am I the asshole?

Edit: for clarification regarding the ring, I'll just put my comment up here because it got buried: 

It went ""missing"" for quite a while. I didn't actually know my aunt had taken it until I saw her wearing it at a family function years later. 

She tried to play it off that it was a different ring and I didn't have the money, time or willpower to deal with it at the time with school and everything. 

My mom was dealing with cancer so I just put it on the back burner.

Also Edit 2: I didn't call them or try to retreive it myself because of the ring. I didn't want it to go missing if I gave them the heads up. 


Thank you for all the replies so far!",15361,sn8fjq,"NTA. Your uncle made the conscious decision to take the silver.

AITA for having high expectations for my bachelorette party?,"Throwaway and mobile account.

I (25F) am getting married to my wonderful fiancé (31m) this fall. 

A week ago I had a bachelorette party. While most girls dream of their weddings, I dreamt about my bachelorette weekend. I put a lot of planning into this weekend, made a lot of phone calls, reservations, everything basically.

For Thursday night - Sunday morning me and 25 of my closest girlfriends rented a house. From the start it was a disaster. I had told my girls to get to the house early on Thursday so they could decorate and set up before I got there. Well I got to the house at 3 and they weren’t done decorating so that bummed me out because I wanted that “WOW!” moment when I came in and saw the set up. I felt robbed but we still had a decent first night.

FrIday I woke everyone up at 7am to make breakfast and get ready because we had a packed day - vineyards, boat, lunch, happy hour drinks, then dinner and the clubs. I was getting shaded on all afternoon because people said they were being rushed from place to place and had to carry changes of clothes all day but we only had limited time in this city and I wanted to make the most of it. 

Saturday was worse. We had brunch at 9am and no one was awake in time so it only ended up being me and a few loyal bridesmaids. We went shopping after for a few hours and when we got back to the house no one was even apologetic even though I was close to tears all day. The last straw for me was later that night when we were going to dinner and nobody was wearing the matching shirts we got for the weekend. People wanted to wear their own stuff but that’s not what we agreed on even though my MOH notified everyone. At that point I said fuck it this weekend was ruined and locked myself in my room to cry. It was even worse when I came out a few hours later and half the girls had gone out anyway (without me, AKA the actual bride). 

I ended up driving home early on Sunday and left the house a mess for the girls to pick up because I was so upset. Now it’s been almost a week, no one has really texted me except some bridesmaids and MOH. 

I know I sound bridezilla-ish. But these are supposed to be my friends and we were supposed to celebrate me all weekend and I felt neglected and I’m just really upset. I understand these expectations may seem like a lot but i made my expectations clear to the group and they just let me down so bad. Tell me AITA?

Here’s an edit because people are asking me the same questions:
1) yes I have 25 people who I genuinely wanted to celebrate with. 6 of them are in my wedding party and the other 19 were college friends, childhood friends, work friends, etc. 

2) MOH sent out the itinerary months ago. It was very clear the activities I planned and their prices per person. If someone had wanted to skip out, it wouldn’t be a problem but all the girls paid accordingly. So they knew what they were getting themselves into.

Edit #2: Well I’m very clearly TA. I’ve decided to apologize for wanting one weekend to be about me. I need to rethink my friend group and make some changes to the wedding invite list. Thanks!",15351,w5n39w,"YTA. A hen do is supposed to be fun for everyone involved, not just for the bride. Which is why it is usually planned by other people for her.
You just ignored everyone's wishes to go with the ""this is my special day, before my other special day"" shtick.

I'm looking forward to your inevitable post about your actual wedding, that one's going to be a banger, too.",2794,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/w5n39w/aita_for_having_high_expectations_for_my/
AITA for pressing charges against my girlfriend's friend for stealing my doll?,"I (26M) have been with my still girlfriend (26F) for almost 4 years. Last year I gave her a key to my house. She spends a few days there, but we don’t live together full time.

A few days ago, I had to make a quick trip for work. She asked me if she could invite a few of her friends to the house for a girl’s night (it was on Thursday). I accepted.

I returned yesterday in the morning. The firs thing I noticed was that the rag doll missing from the wall. My first instinct was to call my girlfriend to ask if she had put it somewhere else, she denied it and said the doll was there (it wasn’t).

I checked the gps of the doll (yes, it has a gps). The gps marked the house of one her friends, let’s call her Jess. I tried to be nice and told my GF to tell her friend to bring it back before 5 pm and I’ll pretend this never happened or I’ll involve the police. She tried to fight it but I told her about the gps.

Well, my GF called me back saying that Jess denied having the doll, we had a huge argument and warned her that I wasn’t playing about getting the police involved.

I waited until 5 and went to the police. We went to her house and got the doll back. I pressed charges.

My GF and I had a bigger argument about me pressing charges.

They (including her) known the doll was made by my father. They could have stolen anything else and I wouldn’t bat an eye. I gave her friend a chance and she tried to play stupid. They have been calling me an asshole and to drop the charges.

EDIT:

I will answer some your question here, if you have more I wll try to answer them.

* The doll is with me. It's a rag doll, better said, it's a raggedy Ann doll.
* My Father had many hobbies, he tried making dolls and was planning to sell them, but the first one he made was a freaking raggedy Ann doll. So it didn't last (he was to manly to sell raggedy Ann dolls, ridiculous, I know). He gave me that one. And actually, he made 4 more for my best friends. The doll was hanging in my room, but once he passed away, I hung it in the living room. It has X’s as eyes and looks creepy because it looks dead.
* It has a gps because my home was robbed 7 months ago, I don’t care if the clean the house as far they leave the doll. I’ve more expensive items she could have stolen so I don’t know why she would steal the bloody doll other than a sick joke.
* My GF never complained about it (at least no to me). I haven’t talked to her other than telling me to drop the charges. I will talk to her tomorrow to find out why she let her friend take the doll (they’ve been here before and never did anything like this). And about our relationship, because right now, I’m thinking in breaking up.

&#x200B;

I hope I do this right.

Before the update I want to give some context about why the doll is so important to me and to correct myself for saying he was too manly to sell dolls.

My father got sick just before I was 15 (kidney failure). He retired and he filled his time with hobbies.

A year after his diagnosis, I came from school one day and he was finishing the doll. I asked him if he was going to sell it, he said yes but not anymore. I asked him why and he replied with “who would buy a doll from a man who looks angry 24/7”. Before his diagnosis, my father would have laughed about it, he would have made more to fill a big box, knock on every door and sell them all.

But now, he was worried about what people would say, if he could sell them, anxious, less energetic, less confident, doubtful, afraid. None of this was in his mind before, the illness was not only beating his body but also his mind.

We thought we had made peace with his desease and the time he had left, but reality finally caught up with us. It was a turning point in the way we moved forward.

I have other things my father made, I carry some with me, others are in a safe. I tried to put the doll in a box, in a closet, I even tried to give it away once, I just don’t have the heart to do it. It gives me peace to see it out there. The tracker may seem excessive but not for me.

My ex knew about this.

The update.

Many of you hit the nail.

My ex came over yesterday. She was a mess. She explained that she actually had a problem with the doll, but instead of telling me, she went to her friends. They told her that it was creepy, weird for a grown man to have a doll, and that I was too attached to it. This only reinforced her feelings. This was a regular topic between them and they came up with ideas to get rid of doll, but she never followed them, until Thursday. Her friends were fed up with her for not doing something as we were planning to move together. Before they left, my ex and Jess talked. They agree that Jess would take the doll and my ex would take care of the rest.

My ex forgot the gps and when I confronted her, she panicked, she actually called Jess and told her about it, but Jess told her not to worry, that I wouldn’t do anything about it. But she was obviously wrong.

I broke up with her, she tried to plead and even suggested couples therapy but I just couldn’t stand being with her anymore.

I called Mr. lawyer and told me that we can continue with the process but nothing will come out of it, even with my ex’s confession. He will try either way.

I’ve already changed the locks and I’m buying cameras for the whole house.

I like to thank all of you who took the time with my mess, I never thought this will get the attention it got. I will try to answer more questions if you have them. I hope everything goes well with all of you and thank you again.",15323,w0wmir,"NTA, but your GF definitely is. Even if she didn't know her friend took the doll, once you told her about the good she should have known you're serious about wanting it back. Had it been me, as a female, if you'd called me and said my cool is pinging at your friend's place, even if I had known nothing about it, I would have shown up at her place and retrieved your item cause I would have felt responsible it happened under my watch and would have cut that friend of, considering she knows how important of an item it is to you.
Do not drop the charges... They had a chance to do the right thing but decided to call you on your bluff, do let them deal with the consequences. As far as your GF goes, think hard before you do anything, but seeing as she doesn't seem to respect your property now, it doesn't bode well for the relationship IMHO",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/w0wmir/aita_for_pressing_charges_against_my_girlfriends/
AITA for telling my sister that she can find somewhere else to stay if she can't take seeing my daughter?,"I (27F) have a 5 year old foster daughter named May. She has been with me for around 8 months now, and I love her to pieces. Im considering adopting her, even.

My sister (31F) Kate recently suffered a miscarriage, and it took a real toll on her marriage. She is getting divorced from her husband, and has been staying with me because she can't bear to live with him right now.

Kate, however, has been a horrible guest to May. Everytime May asks her for something, or talks to her  Kate will burst into tears, or yell at her.

Kate is a great sister to me, and I understand that she's grieving, but that doesn't mean she can lash out at May for simply existing. I've told her off multiple times for yelling at May, but it all came to a head when I confronted her this morning.

May had asked Kate if she could move so she could get to the snack cabinet. Kate snapped at her to ""wait for a damn second, brat"". I overheard from the living room and made Kate move out of the way and told her to apologize to May.

Kate burst into tears, saying that she just couldn't take having May here as a reminder of what she's lost. I told her she is a grown adult, and should know better than to bully a child for her own problems.

I told May to go to her room real quick, and Kate and I got into a huge argument, and I ended up telling her if she couldn't take seeing my foster daughter, she could find somewhere else to stay. 

She left to our parents house and told them everything. I've been getting massages from her all day now.

She tells me I am a horrible sister, and said that she was grieving and asked how I could ""put someone else's kid over her's"". Which I think is a disgusting thing to send to anyone, personally I think she's being insensitive to me and my daughters relationship. 

According to my mom, she's been crying for hours, and won't stop talking about how I'm such a monster for not thinking of her feelings. AITA? I just don't think she has a right to yell at my kid because she lost her's.",15312,y4tyua,"NTA.

AITA for not getting my girlfriend a gift for her birthday," My girlfriend and I have been together for almost 3 years. Gifts have been sorta a sore spot, at least for me. 

So the first year we were together she made me some cake things for my birthday.  Which was nice and everything, but then she took like half of them back to give to her family. It just seemed kinda weird like ""here's your present but I'm taking part of it back"". 

Then her birthday came that year and I did a bunch of stuff for her,  got her balloons, flowers, a card and some gifts. 

Christmas came and I gave her a few gifts,  and didn't get anything.  Fallowing birthday of mine, nothing. For her birthday that year I got her a gift but I didn't go all out like the first year.  

Last Christmas she wanted seat covers for her car, I bought them but wanted to see if she even gave me a card or anything, which she didn't.  We went to lunch a few days  after Christmas she kept insisting on coming over. I felt like I had to give them to her since they were still wrapped and sitting in my living room. But that was sorta the last straw with me and gifts with her. 

My birthday came and same thing, nothing. 

So in almost 3 years of birthday's and Christmases, I got half a gift. I've tried talking to her about it but she just claims ""she forgot "" or ""has so many other people to shop for for Christmas"" etc.

She was dropping hints before her birthday for different  stuff, so I knew what she wanted. I just didn't want to buy it. 

Her birthday came and I didn't get her anything.  I figured why keep putting in the effort and buy gifts for someone that can't be bothered to even make me a card. It's not a financial thing either because we both make about the same amount, and like I said I'd appreciate a homemade card that she drew or something. 

So we went out to celebrate on Saturday.  She kept saying she was excited to get her gift. I took her out to dinner, then she wanted to come over.   So she came over to my house.  

She kept looking around for a while.  Then said ""okay I'm ready to open my gift "".  I said ""what gift?""  She said ""ha ha seriously now... it's my birthdayyyy"" I said "" I knowww"". She said ""quit messing around"". I said ""I'm not messing around,  I really didn't get you anything "". She said ""then why did I come over?"" I said ""I don't know you wanted to.""  She said ""you really didn't even get me a card?"" I said ""no, I just figured we're not doing gifts anymore,  I mean you don't give them so...""

She gave her usual excuses ""you're hard to shop for"" (I'm not I tell her what I'd like and some stuff is only 5-10 bucks) ""well I forget"" and a few other things.  

Then she said ""it's shouldn't be about recieving it's about giving, but thanks for being a passive aggressive asshole and ruining my birthday "".

AITA for being upfront and telling my parents that I am putting them in a home?,"My family is from South Asia but we live in the States.  My parents loved my older brother and tolerated me.  They expected me to just stay home and take care of them and my brother.  

That wasn't for me.  I got a partial scholarship to a state school and GTFO. I worked the four years of my undergrad and was fortunate enough to get a full scholarship for my after degree.  So I graduated university with only a small debt and two degrees.  

I found a career that I really enjoy and a husband who loves me. 

My parents paid for my brother's education and he does very well for himself. But he has chosen to have five children. And they all go to private school and have all kinds of extra curricular activities.  And his wife is a SAHM even though they have a nanny.  I know five young children would be difficult to manage. I'm just saying that she has a degree as well but they have chosen to be a one income household.  

We are expecting our first child. We waited a few years before deciding to start our family. We will be stopping at two and my husband will be getting a vasectomy afterwards.  We are very much in agreement about our future.  

My parents however have decided that they are going to sell their home and come live with us.  We have a large property with an in-law suite in a HCOL city on the west coast.  

I told my husband that I did not want them living with us and he concurred. So I told them no. They said that they already listed their home and that a dutiful daughter would take care of her parents in their old age.  I said that if they gave me all the money from the sale of their home I would find them a nice retirement home where they could live and that I would pay the bills until they passed away.  

They didn't like that idea very much.  They called me an ungrateful child and that it was expected of me. 

I sent them a check for one year's worth of rent, food, utilities, and sundries. I said I moved out one year after I turned 18 and that they were responsible for me up to that point.  I then told them not to contact me again without going through my lawyer.  

I have been playing whack a mole blocking all of their attempts to reach me. And all of the family members both in the States and back home that are calling me an asshole.  

My brother contacted me and said that I was making the family look bad by not taking them in.  So I gave him the choice of either taking them in himself or never bringing it up to me again or I would be going NC with him as well.  

So was I too harsh? And does that make me an asshole?  

I should probably add that they didn't approve of me marrying a person not from their culture and religion.  So they didn't contribute to our wedding even though they did attend.",15283,ymvh7j,"NTA.  I am very impressed with the hard line boundaries you set up so quickly and I have a feeling you will have no problem keeping them.

"AITA for telling step-sis her ""disfigurement"" is karma for being a trash human?","I 27F am engaged to T 30M. We met when I was 8 and became BFFs, but lost contact when I moved in with dad, stepmom (SM), and step-sis V 29F when I was 15. 4 yrs ago, we found one another again and discovered we'd each had feelings for the other but were too afraid to say anything. I was afraid of ruining our friendship. T had insecurities about his appearance and believed I deserved better. T had an accident that caused injuries to his face, neck, and shoulder. Between surgeries and the accident, he has scarring and a facial prosthetic. He's struggled with self-image due to other people's perception of him and it took a lot to convince him that I do find him handsome.

V and SM are obsessed with appearance and judgmental of anyone who doesn't fit their beauty standards. I won't go in public with them because they berate strangers. My dad knew T, but I was hesitant to introduce him to SM and V because I know how they are. When T proposed, my dad insisted we visit for a celebration dinner so T could meet them. I warned T in advance and told him we didn’t have to go but didn’t want to disappoint dad.

At one point, SM asked if we were planning to have a photog at our wedding and if we’d thought about a date closer to Halloween because, “We could all wear masks! Wouldn’t that be fun?” Cue SM and V giggling. I was pissed off and T was uncomfortable. Then, V turned to T and asked, “Seriously. What happened to your face? It looks like someone set it on fire and tried to put it out with a hatchet.”

I lost my mind. T had to carry me from the house because I would've hurt her. T told me to relax and that it was fine. It wasn't. You don't insult the person I care about, who has been nothing but cordial, and expect me not to retaliate. Dad blew up my phone trying to apologize. I told him how hurtful they’d been, and how disgusting it was that two adults can degrade another human over something they have no control over. He told me SM was upset that I’d hurt V and expected me to apologize. I told him that wasn't happening. 2 weeks later, Dad tells me V was in a car accident and ended up with a nasty laceration on her forehead.

This is where I may be TA. I went to dads to get some stuff and V was laying on the couch crying on the phone about how her life was over because she was ugly and disfigured and on and on. I could've ignored her but didn’t. I said, “Now your outside matches your inside. Next time you feel the need to insult someone's looks, maybe take a look in the mirror first before you open your mouth.”

V burst into tears. SM came to see what the ruckus was, and I told her that after seeing V’s face, the idea of a Halloween wedding was growing on me. That didn’t go over well and caused a meltdown at dad’s house. He’s upset with me for upsetting V during “a very vulnerable time” and SM accused me of lacking empathy. They’re demanding I apologize. I’m refusing. T understands why I did what I did but believes I shouldn’t have kicked V while she’s down.",15273,tc7hb9,Definitely NTA.

"AITA for taking ""family"" photos to send out without my actual mom and stepdad (and with friends in costume as them) after they took their family photos without me?","I was born to a teen mom, my mom had me at 17 She later married my stepdad and they had my siblings who are 9 and 12 respectively. I'm 18 and in college now. 

Before Easter, I was at college. And I found out that my mom and stepdad took family photos without me for the cards. 

My mom said that it was just because she needed them printed in time and I was at college... But college is only 25 minutes away and I feel like my stepdad is resentful that their family includes some other guy's child. He also described the photo as of ""close family"" but then backpedaled and said I just wasn't as close physically because I'm at college...

So I decided to play a little joke, I took my younger siblings and two of my best friends to the Walmart photo shop.

And we took deliberately cheesy family photos, all wearing blue jeans and jean jackets. My friends dressed as my mom and stepdad, my female friend wore a bald cap to be my stepdad, and my male friend wore a wig and a denim dress to be my mom. My friend is really talented with makeup and honestly did a great job making them look like them

We took a bunch of pictures, with props, and picked a favorite of us all standing in silly action poses wearing raccoon skin hats. Between the makeup, hair, and big hats, we all agreed my friends looked like my parents when the picture was postcard sized. 

It was honestly a really fun photo, really different than the serious ones my family always takes. I had it printed on cards and signed them with ""Love, The (Name) Family"" 

I swapped the cards in the envelopes my mom had prepared, and resealed them with the sort of stickers she uses. 

Apparently a couple of my extended family members didn't look hard enough at the pictures to notice something was off, and just displayed them. But a few people mentioned to my mom that the picture was ""funny"" which pissed her off because she thought they were talking about her very boring photo of them all sitting on a picnic blanket with a giant Easter basket 

Then my aunt sent a photo of the card to the family group chat and said ""this isn't you, is it?"" And the gig was up... My mom was furious at me for sending out the joke cards and embarrassing the family, and also for not sending the cards she had made and wrote in. 

I told her that I didn't get why she was upset about being left out of the family photo, apparently it isn't a big deal to be treated like you're not part of the family!

She said that I was making a mockery of her and my stepdad by having ""cross dressers' be in the photo. I said that I just wanted a photo with my close family just like my stepdad did and I consider those friends of mine my closest family! Because I guess that's just something we can choose now!

My mom got so mad at me ""sassing"" her that she told me to leave and I went back to college.

I couldn't just take it from him without looking like the bad guy since he already had it  so I laid down strict rules. He was supposed to only ever drive the speed limit and he could only drive it with his dad around and he was supposed to have no passengers on it.

Last Friday while Bryan was at his dad's I get a call from the hospital saying him and his boyfriend ""Clark"" ( 15M) had been in an motarcycle accident. I rush down to the hospital and find Bryan and he's kinda banged , a gash on his forehead ,some cuts and bruises and a concussion. I asked him what happend and  he wouldn't look at me  until he finally got up the neve to tell me they wrecked on his motorcycle while he was taking Clark home from baseball practice and decided to street race some other guy.  He lost control of his bike and they flipped over.

Now I was steaming and asked why the hell he was out riding his motorcycle without his dad and why he would of doing something so stupid especially riding with someone else. He started crying saying he was sorry and that he just wanted to know if Clark was OK. I went to check and found Clark's parents who were pissed and they told me that Clark had  broken a few ribs and his leg and two of his fingers. I promised to take care of the medical bills which calmed them down some.

My husband showed up and tried to explain  and apologize for letting Bryan ride around with his bf and I just went off on him in the middle of the hospital yelling at him that this is the reason why we were separated and that he was an irresponsible parent who never took anything seriously. I went to talk to Bryan still mad and told him that he'd be paying for all of Clark's  medical bills out of his college fund and any money he'd been saving. Since then I've been getting calls from my husband and my inlaws about how I was being a b***tch to my husband and that I shouldn't possibly be taking  college away from Bryan because of a mistake.

AITA for telling my FIL he can starve if he wants because I didn't care?,"My husband and I (both 26) recently hosted a family dinner to announce our pregnancy, it's important to add that my husband doesn't have a close relationship with his father, but we keep him around because he still has 3 minor siblings that we love and care for. My FIL is the type of person that still thinks women should serve men at dinning times (like, he has to be served first because he's the breadwinner and shit like that), we usually don't care since we mostly ignore them, however this time my family was present and we consider he fucked around and found out. 

My dad is my favorite person in the world, my mom died when I was little and my dad took care of my older sister and I, they're the only family I have left, at dinner, both my husband and I cooked things we knew both of our families would like, the first issue started when my FIL tried to sit at one of the heads of the table and my husband said no, he sad at one and I sat at the other, me with my father and sister to either side and him with his brothers, so m FIL was kinda in the middle and didn't like it. The second problem and the cause of all of this is that everyone was kinda serving themselves, however my dad has a damaged nerve on his right hand and he struggles when holding spoons/forks and such (my sister bought him a parkinson-frienly cutlery set that he brings around, but a big spoon for serving is still hard for him), so I offered to serve him his plate while my sister served him his drink and then we all sat to eat and chat. 

Three or four minutes after that, my FIL asks out loud ''Is no one going to serve me my plate?'' and my husband looks at him confused and says ''No, we don't do that here??'' and my MIL just gets up in a hurry and takes his plate but my FIL says no and that ''the hostess did it for her father, so she cand do it for me'' and I say ''Yes, my father who has an injured hand, you're fine'', he says that he won't eat then and I just shrugged and said that he could starve and I didn't cared. He leaves with my MIL and while everyone agrees with me, my own father said that it was a disrespectful thing to say and I should apologize for the way I did it.

AITA for firing an employee returning from maternity leave?,"I feel like the devil right now, so I’ll accept whatever judgement you all have.

I run a team of about 6 people. Our company offers a large amount of maternity leave, 10 months. One of my employees got pregnant recently, i’ll call her Jess. 

Our team does project based work and in the period between her leaving for ML we finished up the project we were working on when she left, and started working on a project without her. 

During this period, our team had to adapt to working without her expertise in certain matters. We adapted and eventually some of us developed the skills needed to do some of her workload.

The situation we have now is me, and 2 others split half the work that Jess used to do, and we hired someone new to come in to the team to handle the other part of Jess’s workload and then some. 

This new employee came at significantly reduced cost, as he was straight out of Uni and we pay him a fraction of what Jess costs currently. 

Now Jess has come back to the team, but there is another issue. 

Our firm has informed us that for some fucking reason we no longer have the budget for a 7 person team, and will have to let someone go. This news came about when I submitted the paperwork for Jess’s return. 

We are 5 months into a project that should take an estimated 10 months, and my decision came down to Jess and the man we hired to replace her. The reason we hired a replacement, which is not normally what we do, is because we anticipated that for this project the workload would be far greater than our current capacity, which it is not. 

As you can tell by the title, I chose the replacement. I did so for the following reasons: 

* Far cheaper, thus freeing up a lot more money than keeping Jess on
* He was up to date with the project and we would be able to move forward seamlessly, whereas with Jess we would have to take time catching her up to speed on half the project
* The clients already knew and liked working with him, whereas they didn’t know Jess at all
* She has been out of the field for a prolonged period, whilst he has been here for the past 9 months, so she may, or may not, find it hard to adapt back to work life, whilst with him it isn’t a question
* He performed his work better than she did hers and interacted better with the team. 

Obviously, the ideal situation which I wanted was to keep both and not put a new single mother with no other job lined up out in the cold, but I had to do right by the team and firm. I told her I’d write her a brilliant Letter of Recommendation, and that in a few months she could try and apply for a job at our firm, hopefully we’ll have the budget, but she snapped at me and told me not to bother, and called me a cunt and left. 

I know I sound cold and heartless but I had to be fair to both employees, not just Jess, right?

AITA for showing up at my brother's wedding pregnant and announcing my baby's gender?,"I (36F) am not close with my family. I live in a different state, so I don't have much contact with them. My brother (30M) got married last weekend and invited me. I told him I'll come and not have a +1. 

My husband and I recently separated, and after that I found out I was pregnant. My extended family didn't know about the separation or about the pregnancy. I told my brother I was pregnant when we spoke on the phone before the wedding, he congratulated me and that was more or less it. My family also knew my marriage was very rocky. My parents also knew about the pregnancy.

So I am 7 months pregnant right now and getting a divorce. When I showed up to the wedding, everyone was super shocked to see me be pregnant and alone there. A lot of questions followed, I answered them with as little info as possible and that was it. 

During the ceremony, the priest mentioned my pregnancy (it's a small town and the priest has been there since I was a kid) to make a joke or whatever about what is next for the bride and groom - babies, something like ""and after OP's baby, hopefully many more will join this beautiful family of Bride ans Groom"". 

Bride was pissed off, because now EVERYONE knew I was pregnant. During the picture taking part of the reception, my brother says ""okay and now I want to take a pic with my favourite sister and my FIRST nephew"". I laughed and said ""niece, actually"" and he was super happy, we took a pic, that's it. 

Bride came to me later and called me an AH for upstaging her wedding with not just my pregnancy but also the ""baby gender announcement"". Her family is obviously on her side, my brother thinks she is acting crazy and I did nothing wrong, and my parents think I should have informed people I was pregnant before coming to the wedding + should have kept quite about gender.

AITA for refusing to tell my wife to stop putting notes in my lunch?,"
Ok, so my wife (27F) has a habit of putting notes (affirmation) in my (31M) lunch when she packs it. She's been doing it for a year now (it started when I suffered from some issues surrounding employment) and I appreciate it a lot because it gives me strength and renews my energy for the rest of the day.

So anyway, my co-workers know about and sometimes would tease me about it calling me a 4th or 5th grader and calling my wife ""granny"". just teasing nothing unusual for them. it happens at lunch where most of the guys in the department sit together.

A co-worker of mine ""Jimmy"" is the newest employee in our company. he lost his wife few months ago and he is sort of a pricate dude in general. however he started sitting with us during lunch break after the guys insisted. I sit and eat my food after I look at the note my wife left then rinse and repeat. Til few days ago, one of the co-workers pulled me aside and we began talking then the note thing was brought up. He told me that Jimmy has been enjoying sitting with us during lunch break but couldn't help but feel uncomfortable with the notes I keep pullinh out of my package every day. He then went on to tell me the dude lost his wife and seeing me getting notes from mine hit a nerve because it reminded him of his late wife. I felt puzzled I asked ok what am I supposed to do about it? he told me to consider telling my wife to stop putting those notes and maybe find some other way to do it instead of bringing them to work and having Jimmy ""look at them"" like...I wasn't sure of what to say but I told him it was ridiculous. he reminded me that Jimmy sent him to me with this message thinking it'd give me more space to react and then told me I literally lose nothing by having some consideration for the poor guy and...be as less insensitive as I can. I told him off and said that it's not my fault Jimmy is struggling with grief and it's not like I even know him that well to be ""acommadating him"" to this extent. He said that I was being cruel and selfish and got the others to witnesd the argument and shame me for my stance but I refused to do it and went back to work on my project.

AITA for snapping at my co-worker and bringing up the state of her marriage?,"I(28F) have been in this job for 5 years. I have also been married to my husband(30M) for the same duration.

Except for the year we were WFH, my husband- who is a florist- has been sending me a small bouquets of flowers every monday (think 3 roses, a small bunch of baby breath...just small arrangements). I have a small vase on my desk where I put them.

This year a new woman joined our workplace. The first monday she was here, when I received my bouquet she asked if it was a special day. Another coworker said that it was a weekly gift from my husband. She made a face and changed the subject.

But she started making comments every single monday when the receptionist brings my gift in. Small things like: ""well we can't all afford to waste our money on stuff like that"" or ""don't you think that's a bit tacky?"". I never reacted to her jabs. I am a pro at selective hearing.

This last monday she went over the lign IMO, she said ""I think your hubby is overcompensating, are you sure he doesn't have a mistress?""

I was pissed, and I said: well some of us love our spouses and like to show it, not all of us are staying in a toxic relationship for the sake of keeping appearances. Which was a low blow, since I knew that she was having trouble with her husband.

She started sobbing and left work early. And while every single person in the office says that I was in the right, that I was more patient than they would have been in my situation. I can't help but feel like I went too far. So AITA?",15207,ujayog,"Nta.

AITA for refusing to give my day off on mother's day to my coworker who lost her kid?,"I'm (22F) a full time student working part time. Last year one of my coworkers who I'll Linda (36F) lost her 8 y/o in an accident, we were terribly heartbroken because we had met the kid a bunch of times before since she was a single mother and sometimes had to take him here. As ~~retribution~~ contribution we singed some off our paid days off so she could take some time, she came back two months after.

I've been working here since I turned 17 yo and when I was 19 we had a change of boss, she basically made mother's day, Christmas and New year's  something ''we all deserved'' and not only the people with kids. She said that if people had kids then we obviously had a mother and we deserved to spent the day with her however she made the compromise to sent the list of names a month before so people could trade them.

Well aside from some guys (who already gave his day) I'm the only non-mother who has it. My mother's still alive, but I went NC with her a few years ago, either way I think it'll be nice to have a day off to prepare for my finals. Some of my mom coworkers asked for the day and I politely said no, well Linda approached me and said that this will be her first mother's day without her son, so she wanted to ask me if I could trade her day with her. Again, I said no and told her how sorry I was, she said thanks and went back to her space. Then, one of the other mom's (who already traded her day with one of the guys) said I was an AH for not giving it to her since I don't even talk to my mom anymore and just for that, I don't deserve it. I asked why didn't she gave her day off and her answer was that she's ''a mother of 5''.

Some are agreeing that I should let her have it because she lost her child but some other (including my boss) said that I'm entitled to keep it and should do it because I'll be using the day for something important too. Linda has been silent since she asked (last Wednesday) and my other coworker is calling me an AH, so I'm not sure.

ETA: Someone sent this to one of my coworkers and now two of them are sending me awful messages and calling me names, I get that I'm a heartless bitch, I'm sorry. I'll give the day to Linda and study when I get home. I don't know how losing a child feels, I don't even plan on having them. But when I decided to go NC with my mom I lost the only family I had, I'm also alone and I have to keep my scholarship so I can study and sometimes get 2 jobs and freelance stuff to pay for my place and my own things If I had another job I'll put in my two weeks notice, but I can't. I hardly take days off because I really need the money, I wasn't even using the day to ''lay around'' or rest. I was trading work from work.

ETA: You know what? fuck it. I won't be bullied into doing something that doesn't benefits me . I won't be trading my day off.

People are more than just marks on the roster, this should have been handled better than 'oh well, you lost the mother's day lottery so if nobody swaps you'll just have to mourn your recently dead child after office hours'

AITA for taking the money I had for my sister's party so I can replace the iPad she stole?,"**UPDATE: My brother just left, apparently my sister has been stealing from him too when she goes to his place, she admitted to just keep the things to herself and that sometimes she can't help it, she acts before she can think much about it. She admitted that she took my iPad but claimed that her intention wasn't hurting me, that's why she left the case, she was planning on taking it to school, brag about it and then return it since it was way too expensive and for once, didn't want to take the risk, but apparently she did lost it or someone took it from her bag because she swears she didn't sold it or anything (I mean after this is just pointless to keep lying). She went to her room and came back with a BUNCH of things, some mine, some my brother's and some that belonged to our cousins and her friends, she even had one of Caleb's rings. We don't know how she did all of this and she refuses to give that information, she also refuses to tell me how she broke into my safe. My parents are outside talking alone and my dad let Caleb spend the night here with me.**

My(17F) sister(15F) has the habit of takings things from my bedroom and keep them or lose them. My father has talked to her, ground her, make her pay them back but she just doesn't listen, my mom always takes her side and makes excuses for her. M dad had enough so he bough me an small safe (against my mom's wishes) and I keep some jewelry, make-up, my diary and gifts from my boyfriend (19M) Caleb.

Cal comes from a upper class family and he's always buying me stuff, most of it gets stolen by my sister but the most precious gift I have for him is an iPad pro he gave me for my 17th birthday on feb 14. I love to draw, is my hobby, my form of expression and how I relax. I used to do it in my laptop, but since Cal gave me the iPad now I can do it in my free time during classes, in the train, the garden, I have more options now. Cal also made a custom case that he paint with a lot of things for me. When I'm out of home I leave it in my safe because is one of the only things I didn't want to lose. And to be honest I don't want my sister putting her hands on it.

I spent two days at my brother's(21M) apartment planning my lil sister's birthday party, when I came back I went to take the iPad to sketch some ideas but I only found the case. I thought I had leave it somewhere else but I was sure I didn't, I also never took the case because is my favorite thing, I looked around my whole room, my dad's office and the garden, since I'm usually there all the time. I also called Cal and asked if I left it in his house but he said no. When my family came back I was awfully crying in the kitchen.

My dad asked what happened and I told her that I couldn't find my iPad. My mom said very lazily ''your sister lost it in the train yesterday''. I asked what and she said ''Your sister took it to school and lost it. Accidents happen, let it go''. I was actually livid, I said that my sister opened my safe (dunno how) and STOLE my tablet. My mom told me to shut up and to never call my sister a theft again, my dad got involved and after much fighting he said that my sister had to pay me back, my sister just said that she didn't had money and attempted to go to her room so I told her that I'll take the money for her party and just keep it for my iPad, she came right at me and told me that I couldn't do it, my mom sided with her and demanded the money but I said ''No, she owes me. I get to keep it'' and ran to my room.

My father said that I could do it and buy another one, my brother transferred the money a few hours ago and is sitting in Cal's account (because I don't have one yet), my sister has been crying because she just lost her sweet sixteen party and says a tablet is worth much less than that.

ETA: my brother is coming home in around 20 min to talk to my parents, I don't know why but it might be about my sister. Cal is also on his way here to install the lock:)

ETA: My brother took my parents and my sister out, I'm at home with Cal right now, he already installed the lock and we're looking to some safes!",15198,t8atkl,"NTA

Your mum is enabling your sister’s behaviour . So long as their are no consequences then she will keep doing this. She lost something extremely important to you after stealing it! Your mum wasn’t even going to replace it. 

Also, why are you funding the party? If she can’t hve a party bc you pulled your money well that’s not your problem.

AITA For Telling My Niece The Family Secret?,"Throwaway Account

I (35f) had two older sisters growing up ""Jane"" and ""Kim."" Kim got sick and died but not before giving birth to my niece ""Laura"" (18f). It had been a year after Kim's passing when Jane and Laura's dad ""Tom"" (42m) confessed to dating and were now engaged. Everyone was surprised but no one was vocally disgusted as me.

I accused them of cheating. Jane and Tom explained that this wasn't something that they planned, but there was no cheating and knew that Kim would would want them to be happy. Convenient since she's, you know, dead. I did not attend the wedding and was upset at how everyone else was so accepting of the relationship, but the thing that hurt me the most was how Jane and Tom intended to completely erase Kim from Laura's life. She was barely 2 when Kim died, and they decided it would be better if Laura thought Jane was her mother in every sense of the word after the adoption was finalized.

Tom got rid of any items that would suggest he and Kim were ever in a relationship and made his family swear to never tell Laura the truth. Jane expected everyone on our side of the family to do the same, but I refused and as such I was denied access to Laura. It hurt but when I thought about all those times Kim cried knowing that she wouldn't live long enough to see Laura grow up there was just no way I could honor the lie.

They even had Laura's name legally changed to something that Jane liked as Kim picked out Laura's first name. I distanced myself from my family over time over this but my parents always tried to get us to reconcile, citing that they didn't like this arrangement either but accepting it was better than not being apart of Laura's life at all. I just couldn't do it.

Growing up Laura had known of me but we never really interacted. Apparently, she's interested in studying a field that I work in and reached out to me through social media. The last time I saw her in person she was 7 and I started to tear up at how much she looked like Kim. We would talk from time to time and eventually Laura asked why I wasn't around. I tried to keep it vague but Laura knew that there was more to the story as I didn't seem like the person I was described to be.

If we had been talking through DMs like before I probably wouldn't have done it but we were video chatting and something about looking directly into her eyes broke me and I confessed to everything. Before Kim died she and I made a series of videos for Laura to watch at her big moments and I told her that if she ever wanted to watch any of them I'd send them. Laura asked me to send some and then I heard nothing from her for days.

Recently I got a call from an enraged Jane and Tom berating me for ruining their family. After Laura watched some of the videos she confronted my parents who confirmed everything. Laura has moved out and currently not speaking to anyone and no one knows where she is right now. Everyone is angry at me. AITA?

ETA: Because I keep seeing this let me clarify

1. My parents talked about Kim and had pictures of her in the house so Laura knew who she was, she just didn't know that Kim gave birth to her.
2. Again, my parents only went along with it because Tom and Jane threatened NC unless they did. I'm upset with what they did but I understand why they did it so that's why I still talk to them.
3. When I said that the last time I saw Laura in person when she was 7 it was in a brief passing. I was coming to visit my parents house and watched her get in the car as I was pulling up to the drive way. I didn't actually speak to her.
4. During her last few weeks of her life Kim and I made a series of videos together so that Kim could leave special messages for Laura for important events. Kim also wrote letters for Laura too. Tom got rid of all the letters and got rid of all the final cuts and backups of the videos but I still had copies that he didn't know about. I honestly forgot about them too and only found them when I was moving and saw them in a small box.
5. Yes, Jane and Tom had two (bio) children together.
6. Unless they changed their minds Jane and Tom had every intention of never telling Laura and didn't think it was a big deal since the family medical history would still be the same.

UPDATE: Laura reached out to me and my parents. She's safe and with her girlfriend.",15191,v7tmor,"NTA, Jane and Tom are absolute trash, your parents less so for covering them up.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/v7tmor/aita_for_telling_my_niece_the_family_secret/
AITA for telling a stranger “it’s weird you chose to sit right next to me when there’s so many other seats available” on the public transit?,"
Update; everyone thinks I’m a female. I’m a male. 

So I took the transit today, and the street car was totally open and available. It’s really nice because there were about 30 different seats available, and I was alone. I was sitting on the window seat and some random stranger just came up to me and sat next to me. I was thinking “why is this guy sitting next to me? There’s like 30 available seats at the front and back and he sat next to me.” So I said to him,”why did you sit next to me? There’s so many other seats everywhere on the street car it’s just a little strange?” He said,” we’ll do you own this seat? Is this your seat? I can sit wherever I want, you’re being unreasonable here.” I said “correct, I don’t own this spot I just don’t understand why you chose to sit right next to me when the entire street car is empty and you can sit anywhere you want on the street car?” He responded the same thing and I thought “okay I don’t want to conflict with a random stranger I don’t even know.”

I ended up getting up and moving because the situation was perplexing to me. It’s like an unwritten rule that if there are an abundance of available seats you sit alone!

So AITA in this situation?",15189,xje902,"This is 100% not proper train etiquette, and the only reason why this guy got pissed off is because you called him out on his creepy fucking behaviour.

WIBTA for suing my DIL?,"Edit: they aren't married, referring to her as DIL is just easier for the sake of storytelling.

Our son and DIL (26 yo) have been together for 2 years and live together. We've always thought she' a very nice girl and she seems to make my son happy, so no problem from us. 

Our son has his own law firm that he’s currently trying to get started. We’re very proud of him, and we’re fortunate enough to help him with a start up loan. DIL works a retail job, that she’s very happy with. 

Some time ago husband and I were over at their apartment and we decided to order some food. Husband and I wanted to pay, and since DIL were ordering from her phone we gave her our card so she could draw the money from our account. We thought it goes without saying this was to draw an amount once, for the lunch. However DIL apparently put our card into her Apple Pay, and have been using it since. 

We didn’t notice for some months but recently saw withdrawals we didn’t recognize. We had our accountant look into it, and he discovered that 1) DIL has been using our card on her phone and that 2) she’s spend around 17K. We were quite shocked and called her up and asked why the hell she’s been using our card. She got very defensive, tries to deny it and eventually said she was entitled to it, and why do we care since we haven’t noticed her use over 4 months. We told her she needed to pay us back immediately or we’d report her actions for theft. 

She apparently doesn’t have the money to pay us back. We’ve gone to our son and he’s offered to pay us back even though he actually cannot afford to. This isn’t about the money for us, but more about the fact that she’s stolen a huge amount of money. While we are comfortable and it took us time to notice, we still recognize the seriousness of stealing 17.000 USD. Our son has completely dismissed her behavior and excused it as her being stressed. She’s taken no responsibility, and we’re honestly wanting to go forward with the police report to teach her consequences to her actions. Would we be TA for doing this?

AITA for calling my niece a spoiled effing brat and making her cry?,"My (22F) sister (28F) recently had to move in with me because she’s getting a divorce and has nowhere to stay. She has a daughter (7F). I live in a two bedroom apartment so it’s cramped and tensions are high.

My niece is terrible to be honest. She screams all day long at the top of her lungs. I work from home so I have tried to get my sister to get her to stop, but she’s so depressed from her divorce that she struggles to get out of bed. I have asked my niece to quiet down myself but she just smirks at me and continues playing and screeching. I have gotten reprimanded at work for it. 

She also recently broke my laptop. I made it clear to both of them that my niece is not allowed to use my electronics minus the living room TV. Lo and behold, niece got her hands on my laptop to play games on it, spilled milk all over it, and ruined it. I was furious but my sister paid to replace it so I let it go.

I have tried many times to talk to my sister about this being unacceptable but keep getting blown off and told to let her grieve in peace. I do feel bad for her so I was doing my best to just put up with it.

Today I came home from errands to find my niece playing on my Nintendo Switch. Mind you this was kept in my room so she must have gone in there and looked for it. Annoyed, I held my hand out and told her to give it. She ignored me. I called for my sister to take care of her daughter but she was asleep and told me to leave her alone. So I just grabbed the Switch right from my niece’s hands and took it back to my room. She started screaming and crying and literally rolling on the floor but I ignored her.

Well she decided that was just not acceptable so she took a Sharpie and drew all over the living room wall. When I saw it, I freaked tf out! I told her she’s a spoiled fucking brat. She started screaming and crying even worse which finally woke my sister up. She came out and instead of being angry and scolding her daughter for her behavior, she scolded ME for yelling at her and calling her a spoiled brat.

Not my proudest moment, but I yelled at my sister that I was being kind by letting them stay with me rent free and I was being treated like absolute shit in return. She wasn’t parenting her child, and I wasn’t going to parent her child for her, so she needed to get her shit together and her daughter under control or they could find somewhere else to stay. Her daughter was not only getting me in trouble at my job, but had no respect for my personal belongings, and now I was probably going to lose my security deposit because she doesn’t accept the word “no.”

My sister started crying, called me an AH, and she and my niece haven’t come out of their room. I feel bad now.

AITA?

EDIT/CLARIFICAFION: Prior to this incident, I have not raised my voice at my niece a single time. I have tried to have talks with her about respecting my home and my things but she couldn’t care less. She also laughed when I cried over my broken laptop. Even then, I did not say a single word to her, I talked to my sister. I have tried to have conversations with my sister about niece’s behavior only to be guilted and told she was going through a hard time.

Niece has always been like this even before the divorce, though I’m sure such a devastating life event has made things worse for her.

I am going to set a date for them to leave once things calm down a bit. I will also talk to my sister about therapy for both of them.",15177,x3ovol,"NTA. Don’t wait too long to make her leave. Right now you are risking your job and apartment. I’m sure your neighbors aren’t too happy about the screaming. Now the niece is damaging your property and apartment, costing you money.

"AITA for telling my daughter she can't use her college money on her bf, which caused her to break up with him?","I know that the title paints me as the total AH, but please hear me out. My (47f) daughter Sara (18f) is a very smart girl. She has a 4.0 GPA, she's valedictorian of her class, and she's just gotten word from her dream college that she has received a full ride scholarship. We have a college fund for her of about 250,000. When we found out about the scholarship, we agreed that we would still give her the money to pay for other things that she would need in college, such as housing, food, etc. Well she came home yesterday kind of sad. I asked her what was the matter. She said that she was not going to go to college anymore. Apparently, her boyfriend Bryan (19m) told her not to go anymore. Some background on Bryan, his family is VERY well off, and his parents have never issued discipline on this child. I mean, he is very rude and disrespectful, and although he seems sweet to my daughter when they are alone, she'll complain that whenever they're out with friends, Bryan is constantly putting her down and comparing her to Instagram models. Bryan is currently enrolled in college, but he has no set course for his future. He's just ""rolling with the cards"" as Sara says. Some other background info is that my daughter is going to school for marine biology. Well, with what my daughter told me about their conversation, She was telling Bryan about her full ride scholarship, and how excited she was to finally go to school for marine biology (he's never supported her dream of being a marine biologist and has always told her to go to college for a ""REAL"" job) when he sat her down and told her to not go to college at all. He told her to wait for him here in our town, and don't worry about getting a job even, because his parents will support her, and that he didn't feel comfortable with her going to college out of state and so far away. He also said that it made him feel unmanly when she has a set course for her future which will give her a good life, while he has none. After she told me what was going on, I didn't make a decision right away, but I knew that I wasn't going to just let my daughter throw away her future like this. She then asked me for her college fund so she could help support Bryan's dreams(?) So I took time to think, and I sat her down today. I told her that she can not have her college fund to spend on Bryan. She started freaking out asking why and it was her money, and I asked her to listen. I asked her if she actually could see a serious future with Bryan in it. She said nothing the first time, and then started crying. I asked her again more gently this time, and she admitted no while still crying. I pleaded with her to please not throw away her future for someone who she can't see herself having a life with. She then nodded and went up to her room for some time to think. From what I've learned, she broke it off with Bryan and he has been calling nom stop, crying and begging to speak to her. I feel very guilty, and sort of like an AH. Am I?",15145,sbg3cb,NTA. She shouldn’t throw away HER dreams and future for a guy who is so demeaning towards her and won’t support her.

AITA for asking my husband’s friend to tell his wife to stop trying to visit my husband when she thinks I’m not there?,"My husband’s primary residence is in Italy, mine is in the UK. On one of my trips to Italy, his housekeeper told me that the wife of my husband’s friend kept trying to visit him while I wasn’t there. She said she came over every single day even though most days he wasn’t even home or was working from home so didn’t even say hello to her. 

We went out together as a group, so I brought it up to her when it was just the two of us and asked her to stop. I told her my husband doesn’t like being disturbed while he works so she should really arrange something instead of just turning up. She waved me off and acted like it was no big deal.

I asked her several more times to stop but she continued to do it the minute I was back in the UK every single time. 

In the end I was so fed up, I contacted her husband and asked him to tell his wife to stop. He wasn’t aware this was going on and said he would speak to her. His wife is now angry at me and is claiming I’m implying things about the type of woman she is. She also said I was treating her like her husband’s property and I was pathetic for telling him instead of just admitting she made me insecure. 

My husband is mostly indifferent but also told me I had caused chaos in their friendship group as everybody knows what’s going on and it’s causing a lot of gossip.

AITA for telling my wife to stop acting out infront of my mom?,"

My wife and I had our babyboy 5 weeks ago. Everythibg's going fine, no health problems or complications whatsoever. However, my wife is often exhausted so I let my mom come over to help out with cleaning and stuff (I can barely have time to work) and also, at the same time, Spend time with the baby and bond with him a little bit.


Thing is my wife acts strange whenever she sees my mom with our son. She'd make a face and talk to her in a descending tone, even raises her voice at her causing mom to feel hurt. I asked my wife about it and she said it was because of what my mom is doing. I asked her to elaporate and she complained about mom holding the baby for long and taking forever to give him back to her. mom argued that my wife could ask nicely instead of outright yelling but my wife defended herself saying that she only starts raising her voice after she's already asked a couple of times and mom won't listen. They started arguing and mom started crying. that's when I felt enraged,  pulled my wife aside and told her to stop acting out and that if she keeps this up then we won't get anymore help from mom. She argued that she was trying to feed our son and that it was awful of me to think of it as ""acting out"". I said I understood her frustration and yes mom can do things that require some patience from us. but a little kindness can go a long way in keeping the peace in this difficult time. She called me selfish and said that it's easy for me to say when I'm not the one ""dealing with this"". from there the argument escalated despite me trying to cut it short. I went outside to calm down and after that my wife started cold shouldering me. I told her this was not okay but she told me to go sc*ew myself and that from now on out I should deal with taking our son back from my mom when it's time for feeding since I ""condone"" this behabior.

I really am not condoning anything and really think she's stressed out yes but the way she behaves around mom is, in my opinion, not okay.


ETM:: My goodness! I'm seeing so much anger here. I'm sorry I can not respond to you all but I just want people to calm down and understand that I in no way  agree with some of my mom's behaviors, just how my wife reacts is......not okay and that's all. really. thank you very much though! Ok. have a nice day.",15136,x87yx8,"When my MIL came over after the birth of our daughter and pulled this exact sh*t my husband’s reaction was to physically take the baby from his mom, hand her to me, and show his mom to her car. 

You support a new mom by supporting her, not by trying to make things easier for yourself.

Edited to add: a mother should never have to ask for her child to be returned to her more than once, no matter who has them or the circumstances. Especially when it pertains to caring for the baby. This is a bananas thing to have to say. If a mom wants her child back, give them back.

AITA for telling my cousin he can’t do an interpretive dance at my dad’s funeral?,"I get this might be a no brainer to some but hear me out.

My dad passed a couple days ago. It was a longtime coming and only made worse by COVID. I’m handling the funeral arrangements as I was named executor of his estate. I included my aunts and uncle in the planning process out of respect. While we were discussing, my aunt said my cousin, who is diagnosed with Asperger Syndrome, wants to perform an interpretive dance at the church infront of the casket to “bid your (my) father farewell”.

I said no, absolutely not. For one this is all happening in a church. The priest would have a stroke. Next, my cousin is not a good dancer. It’s his hobby and I’m happy he found something he loves, but I don’t feel my dad’s funeral is the right venue to showcase his moves to Candle in the Wind.

My aunt is having a fit and my cousin is also extremely upset and has accused me of not letting him say goodbye to him in his own way. I told him that he’s more than welcome to have a dance at the grave whenever he wants but the funeral isn't that time (another cousin told me he was planning to record it for a YouTube video which hard no).

"AITA for reporting my boss, over a nickname?","Im 31yo, female, and recently started a new job. (Well, a few months ago). Its a 5 guys office, plus the boss. The boss is one of those guys who think has a natural charm that ladies would instantly fall for, but he looks like a thumb, and has a lot of dumb confidence for making inappropriate comments, even when talking to me about work issues.

I keep him at arms length, and I'm very professional with my workmates.

Some days ago i was chasing after some workmate, because was procrastinating sending me a document. I went to him to make him send it, and he said ""Ok"". Took his phone, opened the messages' app, and sent me the file, but looking at it, I noticed that he saved my number as ""Jessica Rabbit"".

I asked him about it, confused, and looked at me, shocked, eyes wide opened. Just said ""Im sorry"". I didn't let him go, and interrogating him until he confessed that the boss always calls me ""Jessica Rabbit"".

To be clear, im naturally a red head, got it from mom, and dye my hair red when it gets darker, but I dont look like ""Jessica Rabbit"" im flat as a table, yes, I had trust issues about it, and worked very hard to like my body. I despise the thought of being compared to a hyper sexualized cartoon character.

I talked to my boss when he came into the office, and asked about the nickname. He just said ""Because you both are sexy redheads"", I told him to stop it, because I don't feel safe, he just said ""why are you so angry? Its a compliment"" I said its not and stormed out.

I went to HR to do a formal complaint, the HR lady said that she'll process the complaint, but that it was worthless, because ""Boss is just like that"". I told her that I dont like my boss' attitude, and need a warrant to stop.

Since then, my boss stopped talking to me, and my workmates say that I'm way too dramatic, and dont know how to take a compliment, they also complained that don't feel safe around me, because they dont know if I will twist their words somehow.

Am I TA here?

EDIT: I didnt expect that many comments. Thank you, but now is very hard to read them all, but ive been taking notes, and I'll try my best, even tho, I can afford to be jobless for a few months, so im not scared of quitting if it goes nowhere.

To be clear, I did not snoop on the phone, I was standing, and my coworker has sitting in his chair, so I had a clear view of his phone, and then I saw that he saved my number as ""Jessica Rabbit"".

Oh, and the guys who called me horrible names in my Dm's and wished for horrible things to happen to me, I hope you get help, or otherwise, you never work with or be in a relationship with any women, since you seem to hate women so much.

&#x200B;

Update: Thank you guys for all of your support. I've mailed HR asking for things on writing about their lack of action. Ive got absolutely nothing. Later I found a lawyer, and he sent a strongly worded legal mail to HR, no response yet, that was yesterday (Friday), so let give them time.

The coworker who had my saved as ""Jessica Rabbit"" spoke to me, apologized, and said that he would help me if HR asks for testimonies, or if there is a lawsuit, he said that ""Thumb"" (Boss) always referred to me as ""Jessica Rabbit"" to the point that he (coworker) though that Jessica was my real name. He also told me that they changed my nickname, I am now known as ""Amber Heard"". Im furious, but im keeping a straight face, so they dont punish me further until this gets settled somehow.

AITA for not paying for camp for my son's friend?,"I have two sons David (16) and Shawn (14). David has always been quiet, didn't have a lot of friends, and is a perfectionist. Shawn is more laid back, easy-going, and doesn't let anything bother him.  

Shawn's best friend since they were little has been Frankie. About seven years ago, Frankie's father had a stroke. He was left severely disabled and Frankie's mother Beth is now the sole earner for the family. With summer coming up, and knowing things were tough for the family, my husband and I arranged to pay to send Frankie to the same sleep away camp that we send our sons to. Save for 2020 when camp did not happen we have covered Frankie's summer camp every year.  

David recently came out to us as gay. We of course accept and love our son, and he was very emotional. He revealed that there had been a great deal of bullying at school and Shawn and Frankie had been among the instigators. Frankie had asked David if we had figured out that he was a [slur] yet, made comments about him staring at other boys in the locker room, and told him he belonged in the girl's room.  

When I confronted Shawn, he told me it was just playing around, it wasn't serious, and it was no big deal. I told him that his brother took it seriously, it was a big deal, and it was unacceptable. I've taken away his video games until the end of the school year, and grounded him for a month. He has since apologized to his brother.   

I called Beth and told her what had happened. She was very dismissive. I told her that my son's sexuality was not a punchline and out of respect for his friendship with Shawn to have Frankie leave David alone. Beth replied that David made himself a target by being an overly sensitive tattletale. I told her I didn't want to hear that Frankie had said another bad word about David. She said boys will be boys, they'll have to work it out, and she's not getting involved.  

The first deposit for camp was due this week and I made the decision not to sponsor Frankie. I called the camp office and explained that due to bullying on Frankie's part I would not be paying for camp this year.  

Beth does not know that I've been sponsoring camp since Frankie was 7 as she is only told that an anonymous donor covered camp for him. The only people that know are me, my husband, and the camp office. When I told my husband what I had done, he understood why but felt badly that Frankie wouldn't get to go and Shawn would be without his best friend at camp. He pointed out that Beth would have likely said something if she knew we were paying for camp, but I feel like that's missing the point. He shouldn't act that way because it's wrong, not because we pay for camp.  There's no way that Beth can afford camp and it's likely going to affect her job to have Frankie at home during the day. I feel I made the right choice to protect my son but still feel guilty. Am I the asshole?",15115,u7jg86,"NTA. I think you have to put your son first - can you imagine how he would feel if he found out you continued to sponser his bully to go to camp after you found out what he was doing?

AITA for begging my daughter not to have any more children?,"**Final Update: my daughter came to pick up the kids this evening and I asked her if we could talk.  We were both much calmer this time and I explained my point of view on another baby and feeling blindsided by her declaration of baby #3. She said she mentioned wanting 3 after she got married but I don't recall the conversation.**  

**Our talk was productive and she shared that she is the one pushing for another one while her husband doesn't love the idea but isn't completely against it.  She confessed that she doubts she would still have him on board if he found out they would be paying for childcare this time around.  Her husband grew up on the poorer side and budgets for everything.  He worries about losing his job (why he complained about the kids being around during covid)  and letting his kids down.  I sympathize more with him now that she shared this side of their marriage with me. She admitted that I was probably right about another baby and she is going to talk to Steve tonight about moving forward with this plan but with the caveat that the baby would be in full-time daycare with my husband and me helping in an emergency.** 

**We were also able to discuss our current situation; I expressed that I feel underappreciated given everything I have done for her and her family and she shared that she is jealous that she can't be with them instead.  I felt for her as a working mom myself except I had my summers with my kids. She said she would talk to Steve about enrolling the kids in the before/aftercare program come September and we would take them as we usually do but we can also send them to the program when needed.**  

**I also made sure I gave my grandkids an extra tight hug today after watching what happened in Texas.  It makes my feelings seem very trivial.**  

I (58F) and my husband, Rob (61M) have 2 kids Erica (35F) and Mike (30M). Both kids are married but Erica and her husband Steve (38M) live nearby to us and this issue concerns them.  They work full-time and have 2 kids (5M & 4F).  5 years ago my daughter asked my husband and me if we would be willing to become their full-time childcare so she could continue to work and afford their comfortable life.

We agreed, but we didn't discuss much more than watching the baby and their expectations. I was a teacher and retired 2 years before I could take my pension so my husband continued to work and we made a few sacrifices like vacations and adding to our savings but we were able to make it work so I could take my full pension at 55 and my husband retired a year later.

Our arrangement worked and we enjoyed having the kids except by year 3 (2020) we started to feel like they were taking advantage of our help.  In 2020  during the lockdown, they were both working from home, they expected us to keep the kids all day, and we wanted to split time week since their preschool/daycare was closed. we settled on 2 with them and 3 with us and my SIL complained about it pretty much every day. Things got better when the kids were able to school.

Fast forward to year 4 (2021) we have a bit of a blowup over kindergarten. My daughter did not want 5M to start school in the unknown but I insisted that he needed to go because I needed the break. I also asked for 4F to spend more time at the preschool/daycare program, SIL complained about the cost but I pushed anyway.  They relented and then this past spring SIL pushed for us to take the kids for a week so they could go on a vacation, we said they had to take the kids and he said: ""they couldn't afford it."" No one went on vacation.

Maybe that is too much background but I feel like the context is important for what I said.  My daughter and I were casually having a conversation the other day and she mentioned she had an OBGYN appointment and tests. I asked if everything was okay and she said Steve and her were trying for baby #3.  I asked her what her childcare plan was and she looked at me like I was crazy and said us! I said that it would have been nice if she told me this before trying for another baby, she said it is none of my business, I said it is if I'm providing 5 more years of babysitting! I then told her that we were not a viable childcare option for a new baby and begged her to reconsider.   4F is going off to kindergarten, we feel like we are getting our days back to some extent and refuse to start all over again with an infant. Erica said we are making her choose between her dream of 3 kids and financial stability. I argued that she has two beautiful children and they are financially stable, they shouldn't ruin that with another baby.

I might be TA because Erica feels like we should have told her sooner, I feel like I am not because I never agreed to a lifetime of raising their kids.

&#x200B;

Edit: We will continue to watch our two grandchildren after school and during the summer as this is what we have agreed to and we enjoy it. School provides a nice break for us and then we do fun things with the kids in the summer.  We just don't want to start again with another baby.

Edit 2: Just to add a bit more context and I want to answer some of the comments I am seeing a lot.

\-we are not paid and we didn’t ask to be. I retired early but would have stayed longer if we didn’t watch our grandkids. I probably would have put in another 5 years or so because I loved my job so putting those 5 years into helping my daughter and grandchildren wasn’t a problem. My husband and I did a good job of preparing for retirement and felt we could swing it.

\-we do take time for ourselves. We require 5 weeks a year at a minimum to travel, visit our son or other family. We settled on 5 because our daughter gets 3 weeks of vacation a year and SIL gets 2. At first, SIL complained that he and my daughter would never get a vacation together. We said they would just simply have to arrange other care options if they want time together so we could still have our 5 weeks. We do hold them to this and one time in the past 5 years his parents came down to stay with them and watch the kids during that week we were away.

In terms of telling her not to have another baby, I was trying to make her see everything she does have and to focus less on what she doesn’t have. I would never tell a woman what to do with her body but she is my daughter and I don’t want to see her hurting.

Lastly, my daughter and SIL have plenty of money and are responsible when it comes to costs, if anything, my SIL is cheap so I think their version of stability and many others is very different.",15094,uwgsph,NTA!

AITA for telling my brother and his boyfriend to stop misleading people with their wedding rings when they're not actually married ?,"I (26F) have an older brother (27M) who's been dating another guy (30M) for around 4 years. I don't have any issue with my brother being gay, but I have one with him wearing a wedding ring in order to pretend that he's married to him. You see, we live in a country where gay marriage still isn't allowed (Romania), but despite this, my brother and his boyfriend started wearing weddings rings recently. When I asked my brother about it, he told me that despite not being able to do it legally, they already consider themselves married spiritually and they're hoping that one day gay marriages will be allowed to do legally as well, either by leaving the country or waiting till gay marriages are made legal here as well. While I think this nice, I told him that they shouldn't be wearing wedding rings till they actually get officially married, as I think it's kind of distasteful. He told me that they're just a symbol of their love and that they're not hurting anyone by wearing them, but I disagreed, they're actively misleading people into thinking that they're actually married and frankly just making a mockery out of marriage. 

My brother told me that he doesn't care what other people, including me, think about them wearing wedding rings and maybe they should just mind their own business, then left furiously. Not gonna lie, I think his comment here was kind of out of line, as all I did was to give my opinion on people wearing wedding rings when they're actually married yet and he seemed to take it personally.

My dad had the dress hand-made and designed for my mom before their wedding. when my mom remarried she still refused to sell the dress and got a new dress for her wedding to Brad. She always talks about that dress being mine.

Tessa got engaged last week, she was so excited to show off her ring and talk about her wedding plans. Tessa knows how much the dress means to me. So while talking about her wedding with my mom and Brad. She threw out the idea of wearing the dress my mom saved for me at her wedding cause ""It'll save us so much money""

My mom brought up the fact that she wasn't comfortable with that since she was saving the dress for me. But Brad said my mom should agree since she now has two wedding dresses and I can wear the other one. Tessa also pointed out that the dress would need so many alterations to even fit me since I'm much shorter than my mom and I'm not as thin as my mom. Tessa also said it would be years before I'd need it so it wasn't gonna be an issue.

My mom was on the fence about it but Brad was all for it and pulled the dress out of storage and handed it to Tessa. I freaked out and grabbed the dress out of her hands. I told her she wasn't allowed to wear my mom's dress and that she can get her own mom's dress or buy her own but she wasn't allowed to wear the dress my mom is saving for me.

I locked myself and the dress in my room. all-day my mom has been texting me and coming to the door asking me to come out and talk to her and Brad. Brad has been calling me spoiled and selfish. saying that I'm acting like a huge brat. I just can't let some stranger wear the only thing of my dad I have left.

I feel bad. Tessa is really upset she's been crying and texting me asking me to apologize and give her the dress back. I can't tell if I'm in the wrong.  Brad and Tessa think I'm being an ass but my stepbrother and friends agree that I should stand my ground.",15085,wulpdm,NTA.

AITA For telling my daughter that if she wanted me to raise her baby then she shouldn’t have gotten pregnant?,"My (52M) daughter Amanda (27F) and her husband Chris (25M) married a few months ago. Amanda has lived on her own since college, but still is in the general area. Currently Amanda and Chris aren’t that focused on their future, mostly on having fun and doing things “while they’re still young.” There’s nothing wrong with that, in my opinion, and I think that young people should have that kind of period in their life, especially after the pandemic.

I got a call from Amanda. She and Chris told me how they have taken several tests and confirmed that Amanda is pregnant! They would be hosting an announcement dinner, but wanted immediate family to know right away. They could barely wait as they had been trying since they were married. **(Note that this was an intended pregnancy)** I told them I was thrilled to be a grandpa. 

The dinner party happened last week and the announcement was met with only happiness and excitement. Chris and Amanda were talking to a friend and Chris made a comment along the lines of “Good thing that Bobby (me) will while we’re at work!” I was confused and asked what they were talking about. Amanda revealed that she and Chris were expecting me to always watch the baby while they were working and so they could have “fun time” while not working.

Now I love my children and will never regret being their dad. But I didn’t sign up for a new baby. I’m done with all that. I want to enjoy my retirement and be free without any underage children. I explained this to Amanda and Chris, also that there are many great daycare options in the area.

Amanda began to cause a scene because “You told me you were thrilled to be a grandpa!” I responded that exactly, I was thrilled to be a **grandpa**, not a parent to this baby. She said that I should help out since I don’t have to worry about working (I receive a pension) and that she’s young and these are supposed to be the best years of her life, and she thinks it's unfair that she and Chris’s life should “be all about a baby.”

I was very frank and responded that “Amanda, of course, you and Chris’s life is going to “be all about a baby.” That’s what it means to be a parent. You should not have gotten pregnant if you just expected someone else to raise **your** child.” Amanda yelled at me “Don’t be surprised when I put you in a shitty nursing home”

My son, Michael, says that I was harsh in my delivery by not my message. My son, Nathan, agreed that Amanda and Chris are expecting too much and it was irresponsible to purposely get pregnant when they believe they don’t have time to raise a baby. My sister, Sandra, however, told me my comment was “callous and misogynistic” and I haven’t raised a newborn in twenty years and don’t realize how much harder being a parent has gotten. And I can agree to start providing at least four days of childcare per week then go from there. Multiple family members are agreeing with Sandra, so I’m looking for some unbiased perspectives on here. AITA?",15084,vuu0ks,"Whaaat? Did I just read what I think I read?

AITA for letting my pregnant coworker get in trouble?,"Throwaway account, I'll try to keep it all as brief as possible. English isn't my first language so I apologise if there's any mistakes.

I, (f24), work an office job. 

I have a co-worker, Anne (f28). Anne is currently pregnant, and is around 6 months pregnant.

We have a dedicated break room where we go for lunch, as we aren't allowed to eat anything or drink anything except water bottles in the office because of the computers.

We all have our own break schedules that are the same everyday. Anne and I go to break together, our lunch break is from 13:30 to 14:30. No one else is on this schedule, and take their breaks earlier or later.

In the break room, there's a few chairs and a couple of couches.

Over the past two weeks, Anne had started taking naps on one of the couches during her lunch break. I know it's not my business as to what she does on her break, she can do what she wants.

Last Friday, Anne and I were taking our breaks as usual. I was listening to music on my headphones, and when it was around 14:30, I got up to go back to work. I didn't really pay attention to what Anne was doing.

Everyone was confused and was saying ""where's Anne?"" by around 15:00 because they needed her, and our boss went into the break room and Anne was still sleeping. Anne got a warning from our boss.

Anne is now angry with me, because our breaks end at the same time so I should have woken her up. She said I'm selfish and careless. A lot of our other coworkers are on Anne's side and agree.

I told Anne if she can't wake up, she shouldn't sleep during her break. She said the baby makes her tired and accused me of calling her lazy and being insensitive.

Edit to add on: when my break was ending I was scrolling on my phone and listening to music. I have ADHD, when I do these things I'm quite oblivious to my surroundings. I didn't not wake Anne up because of malice.

If Anne had asked me to wake her up, I would've done so.

Edit: At our work place we can't just leave our work stations, if I left to go look for Anne after getting back to work I would've gotten in trouble. Our boss was already looking for Anne because some of our coworkers needed her for something.

Edit: Anne doesn't normally set an alarm, she just dozes and knows when to wake up usually.

Thank you for the awards!",15068,xetrh0,"NTA. If you looked at her sleeping and said “Fuck Anne, I want her to get in trouble!” you’d be TA even though it still wouldn’t be your responsibility. But if not, you’re not TA. Just because Anne is pregnant doesn’t mean she isn’t a whole ass grownup. What if she was still sleeping on purpose? Maybe she arranged some extra break time with her boss. I know that’s not what happened but the point is it wasn’t your business to meddle. 

Also, why is the focus on you being an AH and not the boss?? Unless she has a history of issues, why couldn’t the boss give a pass to this tired pregnant woman??? If this was the first time this happened he didn’t have to give her a “warning”. He could have just woken her ass up and been empathetic. Ridiculous that the focus is on you.",175,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xetrh0/aita_for_letting_my_pregnant_coworker_get_in/
AITA for making my husband fly coach while I flew first class?,"My husband's (33m) company recently chose him to attend a conference in Miami. They chose just him  and a few of his co-workers out of a ton of candidates so it was quite the honor. The company told them that they were allowed to bring their spouses/partners but that they wouldn't be springing for plane tickets for us, so if they wanted to bring us they'd have to buy tickets out of their own pockets. My husband asked me (32f) if I wanted to go and I emphatically told him that I did; I'd never been to Florida in my life and I thought it'd be a fun trip.

He told me ""great"" but when we went to the website to buy tickets he asked if I'd be OK with flying coach even though he'd be flying first class on the way there--coach on the way home. I asked him why we couldn't just fly together and he replied ""First class is just so expensive. I feel bad but we just can't afford it, especially if we want to go out and have fun in Miami. The flight is only a few hours.""

This really, really bothered me. I understood that a first class ticket for me would strain our budget a bit but what kind of a man lives it up in first class while his wife sits in coach? I asked him just that and he responded ""Come on. I'm taking you along on my work trip. I earned my first class seat by working hard. It's my reward."" But I insisted that if we truly couldn't afford a first class seat for me (we could have; it would have hurt a little but we could have) that he as a gentleman should give up his seat for me. We argued but he ultimately agreed to give me his seat. 

We had a good time in Miami but he's been a little mad at me since, saying that he earned his first class seat; that it was free and cost us nothing unlike my plane ticket, and that I should have just let him enjoy what he'd earned instead of ""guilting him out of it."" I think he's being a baby and that he should have put his wife's comfort above his own, especially since he made the choice to be cheap. We're very close to his parents so we've taken this argument to them for mediation but they are split; his father agrees with me that he wasn't being a gentleman while his mother thinks that he earned his first class seat and that I should have let him have it. So I'll ask all of you; AITA?",15069,xhctzp,"YTA - not so much for the seat situation... More so your whole outlook on this venture.

AITA for letting my mother have a copy of the key to our new home despite my wife's objection?,"

**situation**


I (M34) recently bought a one-story house. Note that it was purchased solely by me, my wife did not help save for it (I started saving for it before I even met here) and it's in my name.


When my parents threw us a party for this happy ocassion, mom asked for a copy of the key in case of an emergency. I let her have it which made my wife upset. She didn't say anything at the time but she waited til we were alone and started arguing with me saying I shouldn't have let my mother have a copy of the key. I said ""why?!"" Since my mother is known to respect privacy and is a very trusted member in the family. She said that she does not feel ""comfortable"" with the idea of someone else, who's not a resident to have a copy of the key. She also brought up how my mother didn't pay a penny towards the house so this should ""disqualify her"" from getting the key. I said it was not a big deal but she kept presisting saying I need to take the key back. Quite frankly, this had me fuming. I pointed out that I'm the one who bought the house and it's my decision to decide who gets to have a copy of the key end of story. She screamed at me saying that ""technically"" she did contribute towards the house savings back when she used to pay for our rent and daily expenses while I saved money. I told her that she was acting as if I put my mom's name on the title which's ridiculous but she said that I have no respect for her opiniins and keep undermining her input.


We've been going back and forth on it since then. She's now ""letting me know"" that if I don't take the key back then she'll do it herself. I think she's being irrational and unreasonable acting like that over a copy of the house key. This decision I made could save us in case of an emergency but she kept downplaying it.


E.T.A I think it's crucial to mention that there's no conflict between my mother and my wife. They're on near perfect terms, alright? I thought that I've already established that above.",15034,yuzl0p,"Anybody thinking of making financial sacrifices to enable their partner to buy a home in their name only?

AITA for telling my son to leave my house after he announced his engagement?,"My son Adam's (24) best friend Carlos (25) passed away over 2 years ago in a car accident, this loss completely devastated Adam to the point where he lost his job, they were like brothers and our family have known his family for years. So we're also very devastated over this loss. 

Carlos left behind his girlfriend and their now 4 yo son, We don't know his girlfriend too well since he didn't bring her around much, they were on and off til their son was born. Adam told me he had been seeing and taking care of Carlos's family's needs which's great, we were glad he was stepping up to make sure that Carlos's family were getting help. Adam also got a new job and we sort of had limited contact for few months. 

He's started visiting us lately and looked different in general, he is now more calm and smiles more often and is even open to talk about Carlos without getting too emotional. I was relieved and happy for him but last week, he contacted me and his dad and said he had something to tell us. He visited and brought Carlos's girlfriend and child with him, we had dinner and then he all of a sudden he told us that he and Carlos's girlfriend have started dating and announced their engagement there. I was in shock, I didn't expect this at all. I didn't know what to say but I felt upset and shocked mostly. Adam noticed my reaction and asked what's wrong, I told him I never expected him to get with his best friend's partner, of all people and talked about how bad this would look to Carlos's family who are close friends to ours. Carlos's girlfriend excused herself and her son to the bathroom and Adam and began arguing, he went on about how I upset his fiancee and that I should be supporting him but I said that he should've told me, and that he shouldn't have got together with his best friend's partner and perhaps use her grief to get her to date him, he acted shocked and called me unbelievable that's when I asked him to leave my house. He got up and left with them. my husband said I messed up by making a scene and reacting the way I did. I went upstairs and stayed alone for an hour. It's been days and Adam hasn't called and my husband keep trying to get me to speak to him but I kept saying I needed time.",15043,tnyr0s,"YTA.

Your reaction is very confusing.  I could understand being concerned about them bonding over grief but you're suggesting that your son is a manipulative creep and you're more concerned about appearances than about your son's happiness. 

Personally,  I think it's wonderful that Carlos' son will be getting a stepdad who knew & loved his biological father and can answer the boy's questions,  and tell him stories about Carlos, and that the young lady won't be put through the painful experience of possibly dating people who would resent Carlos' memory instead of honoring it.

2 years is a perfectly respectable period of mourning and the only thing that I will fault your son for is his decision to spring the engagement on you without having told you a while ago ,without her present,  that  their relationship had become romantic.",4414,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tnyr0s/aita_for_telling_my_son_to_leave_my_house_after/
AITA for getting my sister expelled from school,"I (14m) recently got my twin sister (14f) expelled from school after reporting her for the bullying she did. I don’t think I did anything wrong and my grandpa (72m) is on my side but parents (40m and 40f) think I betrayed sister. 

My sister has never been the nicest person, she got in trouble for bullying in elementary school and earlier in middle school, has gotten detention and ISS before, but this is the worst punishment she’s gotten so far. She can be mean to our siblings and cousins to if she wants to. We are in 8th grade now.

A few weeks ago, I was playing basketball outside during lunch (which we’re allowed to do), me and my friends were having a good time when we saw a boy crying on the grass, me and my friends went to see what was wrong. This boy was telling us about how he was being bullied by a group of kids for being “preppy” (posts skincare routines on TikTok, Starbucks iced coffee, generally seen as a more feminine male aesthetic), kids were calling him gay and the f slur when he’s not gay. We told him we thought he was cool, he started discussing skincare and fashion with us, we don’t know much about it so me and my friends were trying to talk about Nike and stuff about fashion we did know (mostly sports stuff), and he actually knew quite a bit about it, said he’s started taking courses at a local college about fashion history, he’s also in 8th grade like us.

After we calmed him down, we asked him if he wanted to play ball with us and we were amazed at how good he was, he said he’s not really into sports but he was so naturally good, had us playing our hardest and scored against a few of us when playing in teams, we encouraged him to potentially try out for the team in high school and he said he’d consider it.

Over the few weeks, we’ve started to hang out with him more and more, we were at the park playing with him and he dropped his phone, one of my friends picked it up and unintentionally opened up the messages on Instagram since he got a notification for it, he saw someone text him homophobic stuff, the boy noticed my sister was one of the kids sending him the messages, we told him it wasn’t ok and that we’d go to AP with him. My sister and her friends was called into the office and they all got in a bunch of trouble, it was her, 3 other girls and 2 other boys, one of which is her boyfriend. My sister was the ringleader and the cruelest, so she got the harshest punishment and was expelled. 

My mother and father said I shouldn’t have gone to AP and instead talked to them, my grandfather has a different perspective since he was involved in progressive activist groups in his teen years and college years, and while he’s straight, he saw his gay friends get bullied and was horrified about what she was doing, even though it was to a straight boy. My sister is calling me an asshole, a snitch and says she hates me, my friends are reassuring me we did the right thing.",15008,tydxyi,"NTA I think you did your sister a long term favor.

AITA for showing the kids what their dad did?,"
My husband was staying at the hospital for some health issues. After he got out he started wetting the bed every few nights, we talked to the doctor about it and they gave us meds but they take time so they suggested that my husband use adult diapers temporarily. He said no, and since he's too sick to do anything then I'm the one having to clean up every time.


I grew tired of it. He just kept wetting the bed and not even considering diapers at this point. Yesterday morning was my final straw...I saw that he'd wet the bed again and I just kind of went off. I kept talking but it's like he wasn't hearing me at all because he just kept staring at the wall.


The kids heard the fuss and came in asking what was going on. I showed them the state the bed and sheets were in and said ""see your dad keeps wetting the bed and throws a tantrum when asked to wear a diaper"". They stared and my husband looked shocked. He had them leave the room then said I shouldn't have done that. In my defense I wanted to defend myself because I thought it was unfair when the kids accuse me of yelling at their dad ""for no reason"".

He said I humiliated him infront of his kids and made him feel terrible. I told him he can be less embarrassed and feel less terrible when he stops wetting the bed like he was a child. He started crying saying he's struggling with his health and said that I was being cruel and descendant towards him now,  I'm ""trying"" to turn the kids against him as well as shame him infront of them.

My sister visited and when I vented to her about it she said she understood but I was still in the wrong for getting kids involved. I'm feeing conflicted on whether I did the right thing maybe to get him to understand how this has been affecting me as well.

They have this wonderful invention called a condom catheter.  It slips over the penis like a condom and you can attach it to a Foley bag (urine collection bag).

Days ago, BIL left the kids with me for the day then called in the evening asking if I could have them stay with me for the night. I of course agreed. the kids and I fell asleep while we were reading a story and then at 1am. I woke up to some noise. I opened my eyes and saw my BIL slowly claimbing in bed . I freaked out asking what he was doing. He tried to calm me down then said that he saw the kids were with me and wanted to ""join us"". This did not sit right with me...I was confused I asked how he thought this was an appropriate thing to do and he again said that his kids were there so he didn't think I'd mind him being with them. I felt extremly uncomfortable I got up and asked him to please leave the room but he objected saying ""I can't keep him away from his kids"" I told him that I'd have the kids join him in a minute. He eventually walked out. he had the kids get dressed and took them home after calling what I did ""unnecesarily cruel"" and ""rude"".

AITA for telling my wife she will respect our daughter not wanting her to meet her girlfriend because she made it this way ?,"So I have a 16-year-old daughter Harley
My wife is extremely extremely religious and is very against anything other than what is written in the Bible. 

Im still religous but once Harley arrived, It got me thinking that what if my daughter does something that doesn’t fit into my beliefs? 

My wife however is the exact opposite of me. 
Now the conflict, about a year ago my daughter said that she likes girls l, she told me first and then we sat my wife down and told her the news. 

She was not happy with it,my wife didn’t say anything to her and just looked disappointed. 

I was upset at this, as long as her partners aren’t hurting her in any way, it’s not our place to shame her for that. 

I told my wife that she cannot try to tear our daughter down because she doesn’t agree, and she is going to have to make a sacrifice for the sake of our daughter and her well-being and to please make her feel supported 

Turns out my wife was going to my daughter, and showing her all of these different dating apps of only men, trying to set her up with guys, “recommended” her to date one of her friends sons, and forced her to go out with him. She ended up telling my daughter that she was not normal from this and she needs to go to confession, because this is a phase. 

This went on for months and I had no idea, she would stop when I was around,my daughter ended up breaking down when I asked her what was going on and told me everything. 

To say I was angry would be an understatement, I am furious at my wife, Honestly what she did was so outdated and cruel, to the point that I was not sleeping with her and I was sleeping in the guest bedroom for a while, I couldn’t even look at her. 
We went to marriage counseling after this, and my wife hasn’t changed much, she still lets these comments slip, but bites her tongue more I guess. 

My daughter got a girlfriend, and she wanted me to meet her. She sat down with both of us and said that she only wanted me to go, and that she didn’t trust my wife enough to not make a comment at this. 

As I was getting ready my wife was mad about this, saying that she couldn’t believe she could exclude her from this. 

I said she shouldn’t be, she’s made our daughter feel this way, and the only way to fix it is to get over her ridiculous homophobia,I told her that she’s letting her religion get in the way of the love for her daughter and in a few more years she’ll be asking why she doesn’t talk to her anymore. 
I said until she can show our daughter how much we love and support her, she won’t interfere with this, this is a step foward for our daughter, and she doesn’t get to stomp on that. 

My wife started crying and stopped speaking to me, she told our therapist this and he thinks I was wrong because this is what she grewup on, but I think that’s just an excuse for homophobia. My family is also saying I’m an asshole so am I?",14998,xczn6q,"**NTA**

AITA “cheating” to get a promotion?,"I put the “cheating” in quotes because I don’t think it’s cheating but my colleagues disagree. I’m in my 30s and everyone involved are between 30-50. 

About 6 months ago, our unit VP announced his retirement by the end of the year so the company went into search mode. We recently found out our manager will be promoted into the VP position so now his position needs to be filled. Which brings us to my current situation.

I’m single with no kids so I have no other responsibilities except to myself. I really want this position because it’s a visible position and a great stepping stone to my career (as seen by my manager’s promotion) and it’ll almost double my pay. Once we found out about our manager’s promotion, I started to take on extra projects and taking work home. I leave work at my normal hours then work from home until 9 or 10 pm, even on the weekends. All of those extra hours have allowed me to take on harder projects that other people turned down and complete more than anyone else. My manager and the VP have noticed and complimented me on my hustle. My colleagues also noticed my increased production. Last week a work friend asked me how I’m able to do all of those projects in 8 hrs and I told her about my nights and weekends. 

Word got around and this week during our weekly conference call, my colleagues told me to cut it out. They accused me of cheating because I’m putting in the amount of hours they can’t so I’m skewing the production numbers. I refused and don’t think it’s cheating at all and argued they can put in the same amount of hours. Some said they can’t because of family time and others refuse to work hours they won’t get paid for (we’re all on salary). We spent most of the meeting arguing about it.

Am I cheating? AITA?

Edit: I didn’t add it to the post because of character limits. My colleagues and I are all supervisors. I have a mentor who’s a VP in a different unit and he’s advising me on the promotion process and steps I need to take. He also told me what to expect if I get promoted so I’m going into this fully informed. Basically my manager worked about 50-60 hrs a week because it was he’s always on call. I can go into more details but it’ll just bore you. Feel free to ask and I’ll update if I see the same questions repeated.

Edit 2: This has been brought up many times. I won’t get promoted just because I hustled for a month or two. Management looks over my entire career and time at the company. However, my mentor told me to think of it as having an important project coming up and what will I do to complete it. He said my VP and Manager don’t expect me to keep up the production but are looking to see who is climbing for the open position. He goes on to say with everything being equal (skills, knowledge, etc) there is little chance for a person who religiously work only 40 hrs to be promoted to a position that requires 50-60 hrs. Personally I view the double in pay more than compensate for the increasing hrs.

Edit 3: There has been questions about my coworkers and the ones who are most against my extra work. The one “leading the charge” and making the most noise is a lady in her 50s. She’s been here the longest, longer than even our recently promoted manager. We’ve always had a cordial working relationship but she’s been vicious as of late.

We’re all supervisors and are on salary. I know some places require sign in sheets for salary positions but we don’t have such constraint. I do know they audit our computer usage to see how much or little we work.

My colleagues and I all submitted our application and CV for the position. There are other applications from other business units within the company as this is a highly desirable job.

AITA For Refusing To Give in to a Disney Adult?,"AITA For Refusing To Give in to a Disney Adult?

My niece just turned 5 and we got her a MagicMixie. My sister, ""Elsa"" has a strict ""Disney Toy Only"" policy and literally gives us lists of acceptable Disney-only toys, but that's not what my niece wanted. She's been obsessed with getting a MagicMixie since her friend got one. My BIL doesn't care and gets her other stuff all the time. I texted him and he said it was okay to not stick to the list since the grandparents got her stuff that wasn't Disney-related. He said he wants Niece to branch out more and to ignore the list.

""Elsa"" is a **Disney Adul**t. Everything has to be Disney related. Before my niece was born Elsa sent out a facebook post and a family-wide email that anything without a Disney character on it, toys, clothes, bedding, furniture, *anything*, would get thrown out. Not donated, thrown out. We've never actually sent my niece a gift at all because we knew Elsa would throw it away. Disney is her aesthetic and she'll throw things away in front of the people who gift them to her if they're not plastered with cartoon characters.

At her birthday party, Niece opened the MagicMixie and went bananas. Elsa didn't say anything other than a neutral ""how cute"" and then moved on to something else. After the party was over, Elsa went apeshit and said it's my fault she has to throw her kid's toy away. Apparently she and BIL got into a big fight when she tried to throw it out during the party. She also tried to give it to several of the parents at the party. The moms from her mom group called her insensitive that she'd try to get rid of a toy her kid was so excited about and asked if she was going to do that with their gifts.

My mom called me later and said I was a huge AH for not sticking to what Elsa wanted and “making her anxious about the presents” because I guess after the party, her mom group friends got pissed at her when they found out she throws gifts away so she and Niece are uninvited from a lot of spring activities.

AITA for calling my fiancé a jerk?,"My (28F) fiancé (38M) proposed to me last week, we've been dating for 2 years, he has a 15 yo daughter from a previous marriage, her mom passed again 5 years ago and I have a 6 yo son.

When my fiancé and I started to date, I noticed that his daughter had the master bedroom, I found it weird because I've never seen a child taking over the master bedroom before , but he brushed it off saying that the house was ''hers'' so it was normal she slept there, *with no further explanation,* I thought he meant as in inheritance from when he passed away which still was weird because he was alive, but either way, I didn't say anything because we were only beginning and I knew it wasn't my business.

Now that we're engaged, I said that I wanted to move here to live together for a while before we decided the wedding date, he said that we could do it or we could get our own house now because we will have to do it regardless , I asked what was wrong with this one and he said nothing, but that it was her daughter's, to be honest now I did get a little mad, I said it wasn't fair he called it his daughter's when we were about to get marry and he was supposed to adopt my son, so now the house should be theirs and not only hers, I also said I wanted his daughter out of the master because it was ours.

He got a little nervous and said that the house really belonged to his late wife and when she passed, the house became his daughters. He has enough money for maybe 60% of a house, but that we will have to pay off the rest together, I was shocked and said that he could ask her daughter for the house because she's only 15 and he is her dad but he said no, that it was her daughters.

I got angry and called him a jerk because he should've told me the truth before and he said that it's not like we will be homeless or anything, we still have 3 years and maybe 4 after that because his daughter will leave for college, he said he has always known he has to move out and that's why he saved. I asked what else belonged to his daughter that I didn't know of and he said that his car ( a 2020 KIA) the car that I always use will be hers when she leaves for college. I called him a jerk again and  left with my son to my parents house. When I told my family my brother laughed because I talked and acted like a gold digger and called me an AH

AITA for not kicking my best friend out of my wedding after she “spilled” a drink on my SIL at my wedding?,"Around three months, I, 25F, got married to husband 27M. I’ve been hearing about this from my ILs nonstop. 

My husband has younger sister, Alice, 22F, who in my opinion is a total brat. Alice had some type of childhood sickness, but she overcame it, however his parents were extremely lenient with her to the point where she cannot be corrected in any form without it being a big deal. She has been let go from multiple jobs because of this and she doesn’t have many friends, and always has to be the center of attention. At my other SIL’s birthday, their parents got Alice a gift just in case she got jealous. 

I am only child, and the only sisterly figure I have has to be my best friend Marie. We met in third grade, and since we’re both only children, we instantly clicked. We are fiercely protective of each other. 

Husband and I decided to have a summer wedding, and to my surprise, Alice shows up wearing a lacy white dress. If you told me she picked this out of a wedding catalog, I would’ve believed you. Between the wedding and the main reception, we had a cocktail hour. People kept asking me about Alice, and I was becoming visually annoyed. A lot of people thought she was my husband’s ex instead of his sister. 

I could tell the situation was pissing Marie off, and I watched Marie walk over to my husband’s family, greet them, and on her way back she “tripped” and fell by Alice, while holding a glass full of red wine. Alice ran into the bathroom, with MIL following her, and his dad came up to us and started to demand that Marie leave. I told them no, Marie is a lightweight and it was a mistake. Husband backed me up and said that since Marie is thin she can’t handle as much alcohol, but we’d make sure she sobered up before the reception. 

At the reception, Alice was wearing a beautiful green dress brought to you by Ross, and Marie magically felt better.

AITA for following my mom's advice about my breastfeeding wife.,"My wife gave birth recently. She's been trying to breastfeed (our baby doesn't like formula and can't latch onto the silicon nipple properly) but she has a hard time because she isn't producing enough milk. 

My mom who was a midwife  said it was because of stress and that my wife was too stressed out to make enough breastmilk. The doctor and the lactation consultant confirmed that stress does impact the flow of milk. My wife's work has been pinging us even though she has six months of maternity leave. 

My mom moved in with us to help with the baby. My wife's family lives too far to be anything but moral support. She's been making my wife food (stuff that helps with milk production), making my wife rest, making sure she gets enough sleep. 

My mom suggest my wife lie in a quiet, dim room, and I or my mom would rub her feet or her shoulders or would stroke her hair (both these things soothe my wife) and just let her feel relaxed. This has actually worked the best. The important part is to start the process before the baby is hungry.

My wife has an incredibly irritating childhood friend, Becky. Becky is the worst type of soul sucking person. She makes a shitty problem and runs to my wife to fix it. My wife is reluctant to stand up to Becky because Becky was the only girl who didn't make fun of her in their childhood. That's because she treats my wife like her personal servant.

On Sunday, Becky came over because the man she was hooking up dumped her and plus she spent all her money on booze and weed and couldn't afford rent for the month which she was already late on. She expected me to call my wife down so that she could fix her problems. I said no and told her to leave, because my wife was breastfeeding. She insisted and tried to sneak past me and enter our house. I told her that my wife was breastfeeding and that she could not be disturbed, as per my mom's suggestions. I told her that she would stress out my wife with her problems and if she wanted to come in she couldn't talk about them at all

She called me controlling and a momma's boy and friends of my wife later texted me calling me an asshole. My wife says she doesn't care that I told her to leave but said I could be gentler about her problems.",14954,urzqw8,"NTA. We all know what kind of friend Becky is. She's there to use your wife financially and emotionally. This is a trying time for any new mother and parent. I definitely think your wife needs to really sit down with you and have a conversation about this so-called friend. She's not actually there for your wife. Of course, your wife's health comes first. It might not be best to have a difficult conversation right away, but it seems like you and your wife will need to discuss. Becky. I really do think your mom in this case is not overstepping, unlike so many other moms on this site and subreddit. I think she actually has some good advice.

AITA for covering my nephew's mouth when he tried to blow my kiddo's candle's?,"Throwaway. Yes, I know I had a kid way too young.

My(21M) son just turned 4 last Sunday, as usual we had a small party at my mother's house and we invited my brother's(30M) kids (8M, 6M and 5M) and my sisters (27) daughter (4) as well as some neighbors.

Usually when is one of the kids birthday's all of them blows the candles because that's how my mom used to do with us, yet ever since my kiddo turned 2 he has refused to do so. Last year when his cousins had to blow theirs he didn't participated and when his birthday came he didn't want anyone to do it with him, but all of the kids ended up throwing themselves at the cake and did it anyway. 

I kid you not, my son cried for the rest of the evening and refused to eat his cake, my sister talked to her daughter about how that wasn't right but my brother said that my son was a ""little prick"" and he had to learn how to share. We stopped talking for a monthly after that until my mother forced us to make amends.

 A week ago I told them that their kids weren't allowed to blow the candles with my son, my brother didn't liked it of course, but my SIL said that she was gonna explain it to her kids and that it was okay. Fast forward to the party, my gf comes with our kiddo's cake, we gather around the table and we sing happy birthday to my boy, when he's about to blow his goddamn candles I notice that my nephew (6) is about to do it too and I cover his mouth with my hand. My kid doesn't notice, blows them and jumps straight to his momma's arms all happy.

My nephew starts to cry and tells to my brother that ""I didn't let him do it and it's not fair"", my SIL tries to explain him something but my brother comes right at me for ""not letting his kid have fun"", I remind him that I told them my son was gonna do it alone but he says ""that's not how we do it"" and I told him ""Well that's how I do it now, if you don't like it you can leave"". My mom is telling him that I'm joking but my brother took his kids and leaves, my son is obviously confused but ends up playing with some other kids and forgetting about it.

My mom says that I'm and AH for doing it and that my son has to understand that this is our way and is forcing me to apologize, my gf and sister says that I'm right because is my son's birthday after all and I don't know what to do.

ETA: People I get it. We shouldn't be blowing candles. I'll do better next time. That wasn't the question tho.",14934,t73baz,"NTA. A birthday is special, he doesn’t need to share that moment.

AITA: for yelling at my husband that my cancer isn't a choice.,"Eversince I (female31) got diagnosed with cancer (breast cancer) months ago, My husband had to come home from his business stay that lasted for neatly 8 months. He cancelled his contract with the company and got replaced. He drives me to the hospital and takes care of my medication and I'm so grateful for that. but he developed this habit of blaming my condition for every little thing. He'd make comments like ""Because of YOUR cancer now I had to drive in the middle of the night to look for medicine"" and ""because of YOUR cancer I had to pull xyz from my bank account to cover the bills"" and ""becuse of YOUR cancer I haven't seen my family in a while"". or he'd say ""if it wasn't for YOUR cancer I'd had still had my contract"" and ""if it wasn't for YOUR cancer we'd had to beg my dad for help"" basically blaming me for my condition. I grew tired of it but I couldn't say anything thinking he's saying those things out of frustration. but it's become too much and it has worn me down.


Final straw was days ago. he was reheating dinner for himself (he hates to eat anything frozen) and put it on the table and started eating with disgust all over his face. I was grabbing a glass of water so I entered the kitchen where he was staying. He saw me then loudly said ""Who would of ever thought I'd settle for a frozen meal, Because of YOUR cancer now my health is declining because all I eat is frozen junk since you can't even cook!"". I snapped. I yelled at him saying that my cancer isn't a CHOICE, and that I'm not happy with the situation I'm in and that his constant remarks about my condition have gone too far and needed to be stopped. He got mad and argued saying that he's in this too and he's as much affected as I am and that I'm being incredibly unfair by yelling at him for just venting and letting his frustration out so he wouldn't have to bottle it up then explode and leave everything. he threw his fork then walked out.

AITA for not doing anything after discovering that my wife deleted my daughter's novel?,"
Throwaway for privacy reasons.

I have been married to my wife Hannah (36) for 2 years, She and my daughter Morgan (16) don't have a daughter-mother relationship, To be completely transparent here...they both fight often and just don't get along. Morgan used to spend most of her time at her mom's but now is staying with us for school.


I remember Hannah telling me about a novel Morgan has been writing on her laptop, She admitted to sneaking and looking at it without Morgan's knowledge but she praised her writing style and story telling so I thought that was a positive thing.


Yesterday, I got back home and found Morgan and her mom yelling at Hannah. I asked what was happening and Morgon told me that Hannah deleted her novel, Hannah said that Morgan created a character in the novel using her description and name and making her the villian, not only that but she wrote bad words about her, Mirgan argued that it was just a character and Hannah had no business snooping on her laptop to begin with. Hannah broke down crying after my ex wife thratened her. I just watched the 3 of them fight and did nothing nor said a single word. I stepped out for a minute to get fresh air and moments later, Hannah unloaded on me about how I should've defended her in the argument instead of acting so cowerdly, Morgan and her mom also said that I should've done something when Hannah decided to snoop then delet Morgan's months worth of work. It just became too much with the 3 of them berating me and yelling in my face. Morgan went home with her mom and she was crying and refused to speak to me and Hannah checked into a hotel also refusing to speak to me.


The texts from both sides kept coming in both telling me I should've done something and should've took their side in the argument. I just had to stay out of this one, I was on my feet the entire week working, both mental and physical health are down the drain and I'm tired of them fighting all the time then blaming me for my actions/or lack of. both are expecting me to get involved and do something to fix this but I haven't done anything yet.

AITA for snapping at this lady at the grocery store because of my son’s crying?,"My son’s (7 months) been cranky all morning because he’s teething. I (27m) had to go grocery shopping and since it’s just me taking care of him he came with me. Normally he’s calm when I have him in his baby carrier because right now he just wants to be held by me but I forgot that at my mom’s yesterday so went in with his stroller to the market. 

The plan was to be in an out in under 5 mins because he really wasn’t having it today. This lady kept popping up at every aisle I was in. 

Well it’s a small market too so not like she was intentionally following us. 
He wouldn’t stop crying then she’d say “he’s hungry why didn’t you bring his bottle” and I would tell her no he’s not hungry he just ate 15 mins ago. Then it was “uh oh sure hope your daddy remembered to change your diaper this morning” (diaper wasn’t dirty). 

 At some point I picked him up for a little bit, he calmed down when I rocked him then lost his shit again when we got to the check out line because I needed to put him back in his stroller so I could put everything on the counter and pay. It was already a stressful day for me, I’m overwhelmed trying to hurry up putting everything in a bag while my son’s crying. 

This lady is at the checkout line next to mine and she says “maybe next time he should stay at home with mommy don’t you think?” 
Normally I’m not a confrontational person but this one really got to me. “Well his mom passed away so why don’t you just mind your damm business already and go” 

She looked at me a little shocked and then there was other people there too so she was red. The lady didn’t say anything to me at all but then at the parking lot she apologized about his mom but she didn’t think I needed to be rude and throw that at her face because she didn’t know what happened. I really didn’t wanna get into it anymore I just told her to get the hell out of my way and leave me alone. Got in my car and left. Im home now more calm and wondering if she had a point. Because like I said normally I’m not like that with people but since it was already a hard day and stuff it infuriated me so bad. Was it an overreaction though?

AITA For Telling My MIL To Go Fuck Herself,"Hey, so am I (F27) the asshole for telling my MIL (F57) to go fuck herself. So my husband (M31) has a really close relationship with his Mom. It never really bothered me, I thought it was sweet. He has sisters but when I first met his family it became clear to me that my husband was his mothers favourite. She showered him with love and attention, his sisters didn’t really get that. When we first met she looked at me up and down saying, “yes I know all about you”. I thought nothing of it. It’s been like this for a few years, snide comment after snide comment. When I told my husband about it he shook it off telling me it was in my head and I was just feeling insecure. We got married a year ago. His mother wore white to our wedding, it was kind of weird but I decided not to ruin the day. After we were married my MIL started sending me links to websites about trying for babies, and ways to keep husbands satisfied in a relationship. I let her know now was not the time for a baby but when it was she would be the first to know. At Christmas she bought the topic of babies at the dinner table in front of the family. “Have you guys been trying?” , “How frequently?”, “I have a few websites you can read ''. I calmly shut it down, my husband said nothing. When we got home I asked my husband why he didn't say anything. He told me maybe it would be good for me to take the advice and instead of blaming his mother, take a harsh look at myself in the mirror. I was hurt but he apologised and everything went back to normal. Fast forward to Wednesday, my husband and I were dropping off some baskets for the easter egg hunt my in-law has for my nieces and nephews every year. My mother in law said “you look like you’ve gained a bit, are you pregnant yet” I was floored, again my husband was silent. I told her no and she frowned, “from what I've heard you need to work a little bit harder in the bedroom, then it might work”. I looked at her and straight out told her to to go fuck herself and mind her business. She told me that I was being too sensitive and I needed to show her a little more respect, she was just looking out for her baby. I left immediately and went to the car. My husband followed me and asked what the fuck was wrong with me, I told him straight out that she has no place in my sex life and I wanted to know what he had been telling her. He told me to suck it up, I need to respect his mother and that she means well. I was done, I wouldn’t even get in the car, I stood there yelling back and forth with him until my Uber came. It's been a few days and I’m staying at my sister's house. My family have said I was right but I have received multiple calls from my husband's family calling me a bitch and that I should be ashamed of myself, and I should apologise to my mother in law. Fat chance, I just need to know if I am in the wrong, I feel like I’m being made to feel crazy. I’m slowly getting there. So AITA for telling my MIL to go fuck herself? 

Edit: I've seen a couple people mention and I thought I would add, we don't use condoms because my husband said he was allergic to latex so we never used them. However I was always on birth control, and I have notice recently that my pills have been going missing and magically reapearing so I havent been able to take the regularly.

Edit 2: Hey I've been reading your comments for the last few hours and I'm not gonna lie I'm super freaked out. I'm going to stay at my sister's for tonight, tomorrow my brother is going to get my important belongings from our place. I'm gonna take a pregnancy test tomorrow just in case and look into getting a lawyer. I'm avoiding my husbands calls and eating pizza with my sister, fingers crossed all goes well.

WIBTA for not sending a gift for a wedding I wasn't invited to,"My cousin ""Ted"" and I are close in age (few years apart) . We were always close as kids and even into adulthood still kept in touch. 

Then Ted met Maddy a few years ago and started bringing her to family stuff.  I don't have a problem with Maddy but we just didn't click. We talk at family stuff but she's not someone I want to hangout with or become friends with. 


My other cousin (Ted's sister) really clicked with Maddy,  which cool and good for them but I just...don't.  I'm nice and polite but I don't got out of my way to 
become her bestie.

My aunt (Ted's mom) really pushed her on me though.  I don't know if it's because were the same age-ish or what but it was annoying.  Anytime we were both at an event she'd find some way to push us together. I felt like a little kid being forced to play with someone.  

My own college graduation party (grandparents had it because they have a bigger house/yard) had to be moved because Maddy had to work and it wouldn't be nice to exclude her.  Even though it was inconvenient for me and meant most of my friends couldn't come and I had to rush around. 

Anyway like I said I've never been rude or anything to her just never really bonded  with her. 

So Ted and Maddy are getting married soon. I knew he was engaged but I didn't know the wedding was when it is. Another family member asked what I was getting them for a wedding gift and I said ""I don't know"" they said ""better figure it out before wedding date- (which is very soon)"".  I said ""oh I didn't know,  I wasn't invited"". They said ""well maybe it's not personal, you should still get a gift for them"". 

I asked my dad when he got his invitation and I guess it was a while ago.  I said it's crappy that I wasn't invited when I had to reschedule my party for them. 

He said ""that was a graduation party,  this is a wedding.Now that you know about it just be a bigger person and get a gift don't be petty"". 

I don't want to buy them a gift, and I probably won't invite Ted to any future events I have. I don't know why I was left out when everyone else in the family was invited.  Maybe because I'm the only cousin on this side. Maybe it's a budget thing and not personal but I don't want to spend the money on a gift when I wasn't cool enough to invite. 

To me it's like having a birthday party and expecting someone I didn't invite to send me a birthday present.  

AITA if I don't send a gift?",14893,ws0khn,"NTA...it's really fucking weird to revolve a party around some cousin's gf/fiance. Or anyone that doesn't involve the person it's celebrating or an emergency of the person giving it. I could see a sibling.

AITA for driving my daughter inlaw to my daughter's wedding despite my son's disapproval?,"Won't mention names or ages to protect privacy.

My daughter inlwas a sham with 2 kids, my son is the breadwinner. From what I understand he puts child care and other responsibilities upon her using the ""I'm the money maker"" excuse. I noticed she hasn't tagged along with him in any visit for a while.


My daughter's wedding was days ago, I asked my son if his wife was coming with him but he said no. I got mad and told him to let her come but he said it was her decision and she said she was too busy but I called her and she said she wanted to come but he told her to stay home with the kids and no babysitter.

I had enough but I waited till the day of the wedding and brought a trusted babysitter to stay with the kids and took my daughter inlaw with me to the wedding. We got there in my car and when my son saw us he angrily asked what she was doing there. I told him to back off she's with  me. He said I shouldn't have brought her. I told him his behavior was unhinged towards his kids mom. He berated me saying I'm getting involved in his marriage but I'm not. He ended up leaving the wedding and going to a bar.

He called later saying I ruined his night by doing what I did and said I'm enabling his wife's attitude and should be helping him enforce boundaries with her. He expects me to apologize and my husband is backing him up saying I overstepped.

AITA for being upset at my parents who “forgot” me when we ate out?,"So I have a cousin that is about 7 that my extended family on my mother’s side doted on, since she is the youngest, and my uncle had her rather late in life when he is in his late 40s. 

I was about 19 when she was born, so there is a very large age gap between us, so I tend to treat her more as my niece than as my cousin, as she’s about the age of my nieces and nephews (on my dad’s side).

Because my cousin is the youngest, our families tend to let her get away with a lot of stuff that they wouldn’t have let me get away with when I was her age. I’m probably the only one in my family who even reprimanded her for doing something she shouldn’t—like pinching their family helper or using my house’s sofa as her personal see saw.

So I entered college late at 22, so I was so proud when I was able to graduate college with high honours four years after that, and naturally wanted my parents there. HOWEVER, apparently, my cousin has this “very important piano recital” on my graduation day, and she absolutely wanted both my parents there along with HERS.

I thought my parents would at least attend my college graduation, but nooooo. Apparently, their own niece’s piano recital is more important than their own daughter’s graduation. My older brother and his then girlfriend were the ones to attend my graduation.

But fine, I’m an adult, and I have my brother and his girlfriend there. So no loss.

Recently, due to COVID restrictions being lifted in my country, and we are able to dine out again, both our families decided to have a night out for dinner. 

When we were leaving the restaurant, I however got a phone call from work, and has to step away to answer it whilst my dad was footing the bill due to the high noise level. When I finally finished it and went back to where my family were, they were nowhere in sight. Calls to their phones went unanswered.

At this point, I am starting to panic, as I am stranded in the middle of nowhere with just my phone. I made multiple tries to both my parents’ phones, but they didn’t answer. Left with no other choice, I had to hail the equivalent of Uber in my country and went back home. 

Fast forward a few hours (10PM). Both my parents and my uncle’s family enter my house, laughing about something. My uncle was going “where were you? We got tired of waiting, so we just left”, and I told them the same thing I did earlier—that I had to answer a phone call and counter with where were they and why didn’t they answer their phones.

My mom then answered with, “Oh, <cousin> wanted an ice cream. So we went off.”

I totally blew up at that point, saying that they “forgot” their own daughter because their niece wanted an ice cream?! In the heat of anger, I might have said more than I ought to.

Now, my parents and even my uncle’s family are both mad at me for being this upset because they just wanted to get my cousin an ice cream, saying that I’m an adult, and I can always go home by myself. It’s not that which I’m upset about.

We're having another and when I had my ultrasound, I was told it was another girl, again my husband was Happy. Turns out I was told wrong, and it's actually a boy we're having, ny my husband freaked out in excitemet.

His reaction to us having a boy was *nothing* like his either of his reactions to having a girl. He was actually jumping around and yelling, he immediately called all his friends and family, he kept hugging and swinging our daughter around telling her she's getting a brother.

I confronted him about not being this excited about having girls, and he said “cause I wanted a boy ”. I got so pissed off, I don't want him at the baby shower (I guess it's not really a baby shower as we're not asking for anything, but still) or the birth.

AITA - i told my daughter she can live with me with this condition,"i (34m) had a child 10 years ago (nova10). i was a terrible person back then. i didnt stay in her life and i deeply regret it. a few months ago i contacted her mom to see if i can see my child. she happily agreed to coparent with me and seemed relieved which was understandable considering she had 4 other kids, all younger than nova.

nova was a bit distant at first but now we are doing better. she is generally a very good kid but something i realized about her is that no punishment seems to work on her and also she can be very disrespectful at times. if i tell her to do something as a punishment she wont do it or if i ground her she will just leave without my permission

i asked her mom how she punishes her and she said she has never punished her before. what ive heard from nova is that it seems like she would just cuss her out and yell at her which i dont think are good punishments for a kid.

2 nights ago nova asked me if she can live with me from now on. i told her id love it but she can live with me with one condition, she has to follow my rules and be respectful. she didnt say anything after that. after she went back to her moms home my mom, who was there when nova asked me this, told me i was an ah because ""if a kid is asking her deadbeat dad to take her in, there must be something very wrong so you dont make conditions for her you just say yes and take her in""

was i really wrong to have this condition? i cant be a parent if she doesnt listen to me but now both my mom and daughter refuse to talk to me

(her mom will likely have no problem with this, she seems too busy with her other kids and i think she would like being the weekends, fun parent so thats not really a problem)

edit: I took nova out for an ice cream and asked her why she wants to live with me. she said ""i dont want to live with you anymore. you are just gonna send me back anyway"" i apologized to her and told her that i would never send her back and i would be very happy if she lived with me. i just want to know the reason. after talking for a while she said ""i just want to sleep"" turns out after she started coming to my home her mom gave her bedroom to her younger sisters (one of them is a baby) and they cry all night and keep her awake. i told her i will talk to her mom and she will stay with me from now on and that we are gonna have some rules and i expect her to follow them but even if she doesnt, i will still love her and i wont leave her again. she said she is gonna try but she wont promise because apparently annoying me is very fun :D

i called her mom and as i expected she has no problem with this and is willing to let her live with me.",14832,wmhkz1,"ESH except for this ten year old girl.

According to you she’s been screamed at her entire life. She’s never been taught discipline, which is vastly different from punishment. 

Discipline is learning the consequences of your actions and incorporates how to change for the better. Punishment is just about negative reinforcement. 

Her mom has in fact punished her - she yells and curses at her. 

You are someone she barely knows and she’s asked to live with you. My guess is something far worse than yelling is going on.

And when asked this question, your first instinct is to tell a ten a year old you barely know grasping at a way out and a way to be loved that she has to follow rules.

She has to follow them…or what? You stop loving her? She gets kicked out? Her ten year old mind is going to go to the worst place possible, especially if the reason she’s asking in the fist place is due to something traumatic. Be respectful…or whatever the issue is at her mom’s house will happen at yours?

Both you and your ex haven’t been good parents. If you are ready to be one now you need to welcome her with open arms. You need to accept her and give her love knowing things are going to be tough for awhile as you both adjust. You show her patience and what love supposed to look like, especially when she doesn’t follow the rules. You establish a routine and teach her how to deal with conflict and consequences. You find outside help so that you both have an outlet to help process this huge life change. You learn from others how to parent and then you parent your child.

And you absolutely look into why she asked you in the first place.",1377,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wmhkz1/aita_i_told_my_daughter_she_can_live_with_me_with/
AITA for exposing my sisters relationship “secrets” at her birthday after she tried to slut shame me?,"So my sister takes huge pride in being a virgin which is of course amazing for her. We were not raised in a religious family and our parents don’t give a shit so this is all her pure beliefs as to why she wants to wait until she’s married. She is very judgmental so I kept my sex life to myself around her. In a twisted turn of events I ended up getting pregnant just two months after my IUD :) and being pregnant caused my sister to dislike me even more and shame me more for having sex and telling me she hopes the father would leave me a single mom to teach me a lesson about having casual sex. Safe to say I cut her off during my pregnancy but she begged and apologized her way back after my son was born and we became cordial again. 

My sister has a boyfriend she’s been with since she was a junior in high school, she’s now 21 and I’m 22. She always boasted to me about how how they’re waiting till they’re married and how their relationship is built on trust and actual love and not lust and blah blah. To my surprise a few weeks ago my old coworker who I worked with when I was pregnant and who I had confided in about my drama with my sister (cutting her off at the time) calls me and tells me that my sisters boyfriend messaged her on Tinder. She sent me proof of his profile with a fake name with one blurry mirror picture (clearly him) and in the message he said that his girlfriend knows that he has one “just to hook up” because my coworker told him she knows me but then he unmatched her. Luckily she had taken screenshots. To add onto my shock she told me she found my sisters page through mine and already messaged her and my sister blocked her immediately. 

I didn’t say anything until her birthday recently. She was having it in the basement of our house and it was a small get together and just family and her boyfriend (she has no friends surprise surprise). At the very end of the party my son woke up so I went to get him and brought him downstairs. My little cousins were playing with him saying he’s so cute and my sister goes: “Awww he is so cute he looks just like his daddy. Wait ____ which one of the ten guys IS his daddy?” And her and her boyfriend start dying of laughter. Everyone went quiet. I was so embarrassed. I then said “His name is “Trevor” and I met him on Tinder. His girlfriend doesn’t care that he sleeps with other girls. I think you know him!” and smirked at her and her boyfriend. I thought they’d be embarrassed and leave it at that without exposing themselves but my sister started screaming saying that I’m a bitch and to get the fuck out of her party. I went up to my room with my son and that was that. My little cousins put two and two together and made a tinder just to find the profile and they showed my sister downstairs who I could hear shrieking and kicking everyone out. My parents don’t even care about her joke, they’re saying AITA.",14823,tt7oos,NTA- I applaud you for the clap back. I could not imagine being that fixated on my sisters sex life just ew.

AITA for not making my wife cover up at home?,"Throw away account. So my 28M brother came over with his wife yesterday and spent the night with my 27F wife and myself. It is worth mentioning that I come from a Muslim family and my wife does not. When my brother and his wife arrived, my wife was just getting home from work so she was wearing scrubs and her name badge. While I made polite conversation with my brother and SIL, my wife went to change clothes. It is also worth mentioning that my wife has tattoos, piercings, dyed hair and stretched ears. Very much your stereotypical goth girl. Once she was done she came back into our living room in a tank top and a pair of shorts. My brother averted his eyes but my sister in law couldn’t stop looking at my wife. My wife has a tattoo from her thigh to her ankle on her left leg and a tattoo on her calf on her right leg. My wife finally noticed and asked my SIL “ like the tattoo?” To which she simply blushed. My wife smiles and tells her “ you’re fine, I’m used to the stares. You forget how many tattoos and piercings I have.” My SIL and brother both asked her how many. She has 7 piercings and almost 20 tattoos. The evening continues and during dinner, the conversation turns to my wife’s tattoos. My SIL asks if she’s planning more and my wife tells her yes she is  as she’s currently working on a full back piece. My brother rolls his eyes and continues to eat. Shortly after dinner we’re getting ready for bed, it’s worth mentioning that my wife sleeps in a shirt and pj pants. At no point is my wife nude or semi Nude. Before we go to bed my brother comes into our bedroom and my wife is in the process of having me put tattoo lotion into the tattoo on her back, she has her shirt pulled up in the back but has her arms over her chest covering her breasts. My brother sees this and runs from
The room. My wife is embarrassed but I tell her to not worry about it as it’s his fault for not knocking. Once I’m done I go out to see what my brother needed. He tells me “ I shouldn’t see your wife in a state of undress. You need to be a husband and tell her to cover up. My wife did not need to see her body. I did not need to see her body.” I tell him he should have knocked and it’s not my fault or hers. He and his wife left early the next morning. I’ve been getting a lot of phone calls from him and my parents saying my wife is a loose woman and she needs to cover herself. I tell them she doesn’t and to leave her alone. My parents and brother now want an apology from us both. So, am I the asshole?



UPDATE:

Hello everyone! I finally am home from what turned into a crazy day and thought I’d take some time to update everyone on the situation. So here we go: Tonight we went to dinner with my parents, brother and his wife. From the moment we sat down, you could tell my family was uncomfortable. So I tried gently breaking the ice, talking about the weather. Finally my mother asked “ Are you going to apologize for the incident at your home?” My wife being the kind women she is, started to apologize and explain herself but I cut her off and explained that my brother had barged into our bedroom without knocking and that the door had been closed. That fell on deaf ears. I finally demanded to know why they disliked my wife so much. Their answer? She isn’t a proper wife as we do not have kids and we’ve been married going on three years. My wife and I are decidedly child free due to a lot of factors I won’t get into here. My wife is the hardest working woman you will ever meet. She works full time and goes to school full time. I. Saw. Red. I finally snapped back at my parents that my wife and I were a proper married couple children or not. My wife is a proper wife because she is the most supportive, loving and kind woman I have ever met. My mother then asked who would take care of us when we are old? I said we would take care of ourselves and each other. Then the conversation turns to her tattoos. My parents only knew about the one on her forearm and collarbone. My wife then pulls up her sleeves showing she had many many more tattoos now. My mother nearly fainted. My wife is a relatively heavily tattooed woman and I love that about her.  My brother then turns to me and asks I ask my wife to pull her sleeves back down. She finally snaps at him and tells him exactly where he can shove his opinions on her body and what’s going to happen should he ever walk into her bedroom without knocking again. He goes red and is quiet. My wife then turns to me and says she’s leaving and gets up. I follow her outside and she tells me she no longer wants a relationship with my family but she won’t prevent me from seeing them. I tell her I no longer want to see them either until they can apologize and treat her like family. We have Since returned home and my wife is now playing in the floor with our two pit bulls and our Australian shepherd puppy. I may no longer have my parents but I know I’ll always have my wife and I can live with that. So there’s the update",14826,uc2dwn,"Nta.

AITA telling my SIL that she was being a bitch when she kept correcting my dad and reminding her she only speaks one language?,"For some context, both of my parents are mexican and although they both speak English very well, my dad sounds a bit like Gloria from Modern Family, so when we're with him, my siblings (26M,22F and 15M) and I only speak Spanish. My elder brother got married to his wife (28F) two years ago, none of my siblings or I really like her because she believes she's the smartest girl in the whole world and is always, always correcting us on some shit. Mrs Smarty Pants only knows one language, so when she's dinning with us my parents speak English. 

Yesterday my mom made a bomb ass dinner and invited my brother, his wife and my sister to come and eat with us, my brother and I were talking about Pangea and as soon as she came trough the door she ''corrected us'' on the pronunciation (even tho we said it in Spanish and not English) we just rolled our eyes and said nothing because we didn't want to spoil dinner, my parents said hi, she said some more bitchy comments and we all sat to eat. 

We're not a quiet family, we can all talk together or we can do it in groups, since my SIL was there, we were all doing it in English and my younger brother and I were talking to my dad about a movie where the guy escaped on a boat and my dad was saying *boat* as ''*bought*'', my bro and I didn't care because it was pretty obvious given the context, but she said ''it's not *bought*, it's **boat**'', my innocent dad tried to say ''*boat*'' but again, he did it with the *bought* sound and she said ''No, **boat**, not *bought*, **boat**', my dad was obviously embarrassed, but he tried it again, she just sighed and said ''**BOAT**, it's-'' but I cut her off and said ''You're being a bitch. He can't say it, so what? he's not talking to you anyway'', both my brother and my mom looked at me, but my SIL said ''I was just helping'' but I said 'No, you're being rude, how many languages do you speak to be correcting someone?'', my dad took my hand and smiled, but things got awkward and they left, my brother is demanding I apologize because I was an Ah, my dad doesn't think I should do it and my mom is not sure, so idk AITA?",14807,ywj0lk,"She owes your dad an apology.

AITA for not telling my family that I have a child?,"My wife (35F) and I (36M) live across the country from my family and we only visit for weddings, funerals and other big family-related events. 

Both my wife and I are deaf. I've never been close with anyone in my family: my grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, brother and father (single dad), because they never bothered to look past my disability. Growing up they only did the bare minimum: fed me, clothed me, made small talk but they never actually tried to get to know me or do anything beyond that. They didn't even learn sign language for me. I can talk and read lips but I'm often left out of their conversations.

They never bothered to get to know my wife either. They think that we're both stupid and incapable of anything just because we can't hear. We're in our 30s, and they still treat us like children. We hate it, especially my wife who has purposefully not visited them since 2017.

I have a successful career, and so does my wife, and we've been completely on our own since college. We have a healthy bank account, we travel a lot and we're ready to buy a nice house but we're waiting for the housing market to cool down. Despite all that, my family thinks that my wife's family takes care of us, i.e. help out financially, manage our finances and walk us through everyday tasks like buying groceries or paying bills. They just won't believe that we're intelligent and perfectly capable people who have done well for ourselves all on our own.

My older brother is not deaf and he's very close with my whole family. He doesn't have his life together. He works odd jobs, he has unstable relationships and he regularly mooches off people. Yet my family still reveres him as a smart and capable person. He's a narcissist who has always treated me poorly and my family enables his bad behavior. That's another reason I keep them at arm's length.

I hope I've given enough context. So now on to the issue: my wife and I have a 2-year-old daughter. When my wife was pregnant we decided that we didn't want any of my family in our daughter's life. It wouldn't be healthy for her to be around people who constantly disrespect her parents. And if she turned out deaf (she didn't), they wouldn't treat her with respect either. No one in my family keeps in touch with me anyway so I didn't see a reason to volunteer any information to them. So I never told them about my daughter. We keep her off social media and I visited them only once since she was born, but she stayed home with my wife. 

My brother somehow found out about my daughter's existence a few weeks ago. The whole family is very upset. They blamed my wife because they think that she controls me, which is not true at all. They accused me of denying my daughter a family that could've helped raise her in many different ways. They may have a point. I'm starting to wonder if my wife and I are selfish for keeping our daughter from a big family full of cousins her age because we have our own hang-ups about them.

These kids will kick a ball around inside, breaking our possessions more than once, will bounce on the furniture with shoes on and leave stains on them, have emptied storage containers in our house on the floor and walked away with what they wanted to get, leaving the rest there. My husband and I have both stepped in and asked them not to and the response we get back is ""you're not our mom/dad"". I am aware this is true but it is our home. We have put stuff up only for them to go inside and get it anyway. We said no shoes inside and they straight up said no. They have also gotten other balls when we take them away while they play with them inside. They're the very same at my ILs house. The oldest even told FIL to fuck off when he corrected them. So I made the decision that if my husband wants to deal with all that he can, but while I am home without him they are not coming in. SIL attempted to come over with the kids while my husband was away for work. I told her she wasn't allowed in.

I also don't like her and would never spend time with her outside of something family related. And even then I'm not hanging out with her. We're just in the same space.

My baby shower was organized by my cousin who is a very good friend as well as two other very close friends. The shower is today actually. 

My stepsister had nobody offer to throw her a shower and weeks ago my mom asked me to let her share mine. I said no. My stepsister then asked me to throw her one. I said no yet again. We're not close enough for me to invite her so I'm not going to spend my money throwing her one.

My mom told me she has nobody, that none of her friends offered and nobody in her bio family or our side offered either. I told mom it's not my fault she has nobody. I pointed out it's time for them to ask why people don't want to do this for her, why she has no support network outside of her and her husband. Mom said I should be doing more because we're ""sisters"". My reply was her lack of support network and baby shower are not my problem.

For context: my stepsister and I both lost our other parent. My mom married her dad when I was 9, she was 8. She has always claimed her loss was greater than mine, has outright told me I don't have the right to grieve him the way she grieves her mom. She made up a lie when she was 14 about my paternal grandparents calling her an unwanted bastard because she was jealous they wouldn't take her out when they spent time with me. She told my cousin (paternal cousin) that they had to treat her like family or she'd get them in trouble too. It's how she got found out. She's also the kind of person who expects you to do what she wants and would never reciprocate. So I dislike her. I don't consider her my family and I still call myself an only child.

AITA for refusing to lie to my niece about why she is not allowed to come skiing with me?,"I (F29) have a brother, Hugo (M31). When Hugo was 19 he got his then-girlfriend Amy pregnant. They had their daughter Ashley (now 11) and later got married and had a baby boy (4). 

Over the years, I've become close to Ashley. When I'm home (I live abroad) I take her out to shows, shopping, horse riding etc. We also keep in contact via text. She’s bright and thoughtful, just a pleasure to have around. Amy has never liked me but has mostly put this aside for Ashley.

Me and my bf are visiting my family for Christmas and then leaving to go skiing. We arranged for Ashley to come skiing and stay with us for New Years. Amy wasn't keen on this idea but relented because Ashley was excited to learn how to ski, as all her school friends do.

I took my bf's hire car to pick Ashley up from school on Friday, and she was excited because it's a sports car and I let her friends sit in it and take pictures. At dinner, she asked if I would drive her to and chaperone her and her friends going ice skating on Tuesday in town. Hugo said I probably didn't want to look after a bunch of kids, and Amy had already planned to chaperone. Ashley ignored him and begged me to chaperone. I didn't really mind but Amy looked annoyed so I said I wouldn't want to mess with the established plan. Ashley kept pushing, and said she didn't want Amy to come because Amy dressed badly and was never fun and embarrassed her. Hugo told her to apologise, which she did, but she also kept insisting it was true. Amy got teary and Hugo kept telling Ashley she’d upset her mother but this just made Ashley angrier and she dug her heels in. Because of this, she was told she was not allowed to go ice skating and is now not speaking to Amy.

Yesterday, Amy and Hugo came to me and said they didn’t want Ashley to come skiing anymore. Amy feels like Ashley needs to spend more time with her family and Hugo is supporting her. They asked if I would tell Ashley that me and bf had changed our plans and wouldn’t be going on the trip anymore. I asked why and they said if they told Ashley the truth that she would blame Amy and that would defeat the point of her trying to build a bridge with Ashley. I said I understand that but I didn’t feel right lying to Ashley and if her parents had made the decision they need to deal with the consequences not push it onto me. Amy said if I cared about Ashley I would realise it’s best for me to fall on my sword rather than alienate her further from her mother. I said no again but Hugo said we should all take until Wednesday to think about it. Ashley is still being very standoffish to her mother, and I know if she finds out her mother cancelled the ski trip it will get worse, so now I’m wondering if I should go along with Amy’s plan. I just want what’s best for Ashley. AITA?

Editing to add the background to Amy and Ashley’s relationship (commented this elsewhere): A lot of it comes from Amy trying very hard to be Ashley’s friend. Amy was young when she had Ashley and she was quite isolated caring for her while Hugo worked and went to uni (he was cut off by our parents at that time). She threw all her efforts into being a mum and being as close to Ashley as humanly possible. Ashley has explained to me that this has become very suffocating to her. She is trying to forge her own circle and she feels like Amy insists on being part of it, while also refusing to engage with her on her level.

The second part is that my parents pay for Ashley to attend a very prestigious private school. Hugo and Amy are nowhere near as affluent as the other families and Ashley feels a bit left out. It’s part of the reason I have chipped in for some of her extra curricular activities. But the fact is, she doesn’t always feel like she fits in, which is hard for her. Her school is full of non-working “Range Rover/birkin” mothers who are either “cool” or absent, and Amy is neither. She’s involved but Ashley finds her stifling, and doesn’t want her involved in her social life.

it’s also my opinion that Ashley is trying to get some emotional space from her mother only way she knows how - by making her not want to spend time with her. Amy doesn’t respond to her requests so I think she’s just resorting to being mean to her. Which obviously isn’t okay.

Edit 2 since this is being asked a lot: Ashley and I have talked since the dinner and she knows I think she shouldn’t have said what she said, we’ve talked about it. Even she said she shouldn’t have said what she said. Did I go ham and tell her she’s entitled/spoilt/throw the kitchen sink at her? No. But she knows I think she was wrong and she agree.

AITA for jogging at 4am?,"I'm an Emergency Medical Dispatcher which basically means if you call 999 with an emergency and need an ambulance there is a chance it'll go to me. It's a rewarding if stressful job and some of the calls i've handled give me nightmares but I wouldn't change my job. Some of my hours however are extremely unsociable and sometimes I get home at 4am and when I do I have a routine. 

When I get home at 4am i'll quickly change then go for an hour long jog while I listen to podcast. This jog by 5am will take me to my boyfriends bakery where we will share a meal: breakfast for him, dinner for me. On the days I work this kind of shift it's the only time we can see each other, I then help him set up a little before heading back to my home and sleeping. 

All in all nothing abnormal ever happens but a new neighbour recently moved into my cul-de-sac, a woman in her late 30s or early 40s i'm not sure, I don't know my neighbours THAT well as I don't often have the ability to socialise with them due to my work hours. During one of my recent jogs I paused on my way out of the cul-de-sac on the pavement near her home to pick out a podcast on my phone only to have her come out shouting at me about what am I doing near her home and how I better get before she calls the police. I quickly apologised to her and explained i'm her neighbour, and just out for a jog, she didn't believe me so in sight of her I had to go unlock my front door to prove to her yes I lived here as she kept shouting about the police, after this she stopped and retreated back into her home so I continued my jog.

Except she was watching me the next time I jogged and the next, and the next. Each time calling out vague threats about the police and how I shouldn't be out at this time and how I was scaring her children always being out at this time, now I admit i'd finally had enough of this and laughed at her because i'm a 5 foot tall woman who looks like a solid breeze would blow me over I also told her to mind her own fucking business and how only she seems like the weirdo here always watching me go for a jog at this hour. I also told her if she called 999 to say hi to my co-workers for me. 

I'm not proud of how I lost my temper but it is getting to me how she is always doing this, it wasn't until my boyfriend suggested over our shared meal that day that maybe she just had anxiety and seeing someone outside so early put her on edge and she was handling it poorly, I admit I felt guilty after that i'd thought me jogging for an hour after my shift was harmless but i'm used to being up at weird hours am I the asshole for jogging at this time? would it freak you out if one of your neighbours did this?",14744,t9hrmw,"NTA.

AITA for turning my wife's joke about my ED back on her?,"I'm a 32-year-old man, and my wife Jess is a 26-year-old woman. We have been married for three years.

Six months ago, I started to experience erectile dysfunction. This has largely been spurred by anxiety. It's a medical condition that I am currently seeing a doctor for.

Jess has gone between blaming me and then blaming herself. Basically weekly the pendulum swings one way or the other. Lately, she has found humor in it, and I guess I can laugh at myself a little. It's only a severe psychological symptom and all that jazz.

Well, on Friday night we met up for friends with drinks. Including us, there were six people at the table. The discussion turned into a direction that led a very drunk Jess to saying ""Yeah, and I'm not getting any because this guy can't even get it up!"" while pointing at me. My first reaction was shock that she'd say something that horrible and private about me, but without missing a beat, I responded ""Yeah, and with a wife like this can you even blame me?""

Everyone laughed and assumed we were kidding and it was a silly thing we had. I mean what kind of a 32 year old gets ED in the first place, right? Well, the next morning, Jess was incredibly hung over but distinctly remembered what I said and got very upset. It wasn't a real screaming her head off type, but a quiet ""how dare you"" type. I responded that she just threw everything about me on the table, to which she responded that it was more of a spur the moment thing while my response was ""calculated.""

I don't think I was the asshole here, but was I?",14737,vfqj63,"My husband had an ED problem a few years back due to stress and stuff.

AITA for “rudely” inviting my SIL to leave and get some therapy for the way she kept talking about my child?,"Using a new account, hoping her sister doesn’t find this because I know she’s on Reddit… My wife’s (32f) younger sister (24f) is in college in our area. 

Her lease was temporary where she was living so she’s staying with us while she looks for a new place. Honestly I (30m) am not a big fan of hers. She’s kind of bratty? But what really made me not stand her is her attitude with our 10 month old son. Anytime the subject of my son/kids come up she finds a way to make it about her being child-free. 

Example 1: when we announced our pregnancy to her family. Everyone was happy for us. Her reaction was  “eww that’s so gross”. Then telling us sorry it’s just weird for her thinking about being pregnant and glad she’s never going to. 

That already put us off and soured the moment. Didn’t change throughout my wife’s  pregnancy so we ignored her. After our son was born she threw a fit because my in laws sent her a couple of pics and she called my wife asking her to tell their parents not to send her anything because not everyone cares about babies. We weren’t the ones who sent it to her but still mad at us for “shoving our baby down her throat.” My wife’s gotten mad about her attitude. Her folks say she’s expressing herself and not to take it personally.

When we let her move in it got worse. If my son cries she loudly says “oh my god shut him up see this is why- yada yada won’t have kids, etc.” “He’s so annoying, he’s so needy,” makes dramatic gagging noises when we’re feeding him fruits and tells us to take him somewhere else for that (which we don’t, my wife just tells her to fucking deal with it). 

I can understand someone personally not liking kids and never wanting any. What I don’t is going out of your way to always talk about how much you hate them. 

Anything my son does she always has to say something. I don’t appreciate that negativity towards my child. Earlier my son hit his head and started crying. I calmed him down after a minute, w/o asking for her opinion she says you guys had months to abort, you did this to yourselves. So I snapped at her. That if she hates babies so much then she’s welcome to get the hell out of my house, don’t understand what deep hate she has for kids but maybe get some therapy because it’s one thing to not like them, it’s another to always wanna make it known how much you despise them. 

And that I was tired of her annoying rants while she’s eating our food for free complaining about a baby while she’s acting like one herself. 

So yeah it was quite a bit what I said. She didn’t say anything after but told my wife. Then their parents. And reason they think I was a jerk is because I threatened her living situation when she wouldn’t have any place to go right now and we’re her only option. My wife agrees with me which triggered an argument with her parents. I get she’s still young and dumb so that’s why I’m asking if I’m TA",14737,sop0w9,"Whew boy, NTA. You’re right, if she doesn’t like it, she can get the hell out and stay out. Holy shit she sounds like a miserable expletive. Glad your wife is backing you on this too. I’d tell her to get out.

AITA for leaving the restaurant because of what my husband did?,"I would like to start and say that my F.29 husband M.35 comes from a well off family and most of his friends are well off as well. Unlike me and my family we come from humble, working class and don't own lot of assets like my inlaws do.


My husband cares about appearances. at first he didn't try to control how I look, butdid buy me things he said I'd love but nothing was my style really. After marriage he sat with me telling me I get 100% to choose how I look except when I'm with him or his family and introduced me to brands to choose my new clothes from and I started wearing them whenever I'm with his family and friends. although it limited my choice on what to wear because I'm more into simple things.


For his friend's birthday that was celebrated at an upscale restaurant. My husband bought me a $300. dress to wear for the ocassion but I didn't like many things about it. I told him I'd just wear my $60 floral maxi dress. He didn't think it was a good idea and said I was violating the ""rules"" he gave after we got married but I said the dress he bought wasn't my style. I said I either wear my dress or not go. He said fine then whatever but still wasn't happy.


We got to the restaurant and no one said anything about my dress (except his other friend who said I looked great). After dinner, my husband moved quickly and spilled wine all over my chest and lap. He freaked out and said that he thankfully had a replacement then pulled out the $300 he previously wanted me to wear out of the bag. This whole time I couldn't help but think he deliberately spilled the wine on my floral dress to force me into wearing the other dress. He handed me the dress and told me to go change. I got up but instead of going to the restroom, I made my way to the door. He asked me to wait but I kept walking while opening my phone to get an Uber to get me home. I stood outside and started arguing with him, he said he didn't get why I was behaving like this and embarrassing both him and myself like that. I said that he looked down on my dress and tried to trick me into wearing what he wanted by spilling wine on me. He told me to go back inside but I said I won't move til my Uber arrived. He threw a fit calling me an embarrassement and stood there till I left.


At home he went off saying I could've worn the dress and not make a scene, and then double down and walk out. again, I said he disrespected my choices and implied I was an embarrassement. he said he was just calling a spade a spade and I should quit acting so insensitive and getting offended over nothing.

He said I made a joke out of him infront of his friends and one of them (the one who complimented my dress, and the one who constantly tries to video chat with me whenever he sees me online) tried to call me but I didn't respond because he made me feel uncomfortable.

"AITA for ""making"" my daughter choose who she wants to walk her down the aisle (me, or her stepdad)?","

I have a 22 year old daughter (Chloe), her mom and were never married. Because of circumstances that I couldn't be in her life for long...then, her mom got married when she was 5 to her stepdad who is a somewhat decent guy, nosy but decent.


I came back to the country when Chloe was 16, and she was open to the idea of rebuilding our relationship. though, her mom always throws in my face that Chloe's stepdad is ""the real/legal parent"" and has always been to Chloe but she knows about the bond I have with Chloe or the things I'd gone through in the past so I ignore her judgemental remarks.



Chloe's getting married come Feb, I was taken back when she told me she was considering having me AND her stepdad walk her down the aisle, I went to have a conversation with her to talk about how uncomfortable I was with this idea. she talked about how her stepdad played huge part in her life and how she wanted to honor that by including him. I told her of course and I absolutely won't invalidate her feelings or deny how much of a good influence her stepdad's been but, I just don't feel comfortable with it and told her it'd be ok if I was just a guest there, but she said she wants me to be part of this so bad. I said it's either me or her stepdad because there is no way I'm doing this with him. she thought that was petty but it wasn't, she got upset saying it wasn't okay of me to put her in this position and make her choose and force her hand but really, ultimately, the choice is hers so how am I forcing her hand?.


She complained about how I was ruining her wedding and making it about my resentment towards her stepdad. The argument escalated to the point where I said I won't come to the wedding if she continues to force the issue.


Her mom contacted me calling me selfish, jealous, spiteful and whatnot claiming I was willing to hurt Chloe's feelings out of spite just because she dared show appreciation for the man who stepped up and was more of parent to her more than I'll ever be. I told her ""stay out of it...you're the reason we're having this problem, stay out of it this is between me and Chloe"". Chloe isn't answering my phonecalls, I tried speaking to her fiance and he said Chloe is upset by the fact I put my feelings above hers and disrespected her stepdad by asking her to choose between us. he advised me to do this one thing for her since it's important but I'm feeling uneasy even thinking about so I don't think I'll ever be okay with it.",14722,sfgdjk,[deleted],8601,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/sfgdjk/aita_for_making_my_daughter_choose_who_she_wants/
AITA for going to my friends house when my wife told me to fuck off?,"Throw away cause I don’t want family members finding out my issues.

My(28m) wife (27f) is 7 months pregnant. Since she’s been pregnant she has been having a go at me for small things like if I don’t make dinner for her or when I cook her the wrong thing. Before she was pregnant she was never like this she was always very sweet. 

Yesterday my wife came back from her parents house and I made homemade pizza for us. She told me she doesn’t want pizza and to cook her something else. I told her if it’s quick and easy I’ll make it, she asked for homemade chicken dumplings. I told her I’m not making that because that will take ages. She told me she’s pregnant and is craving dumplings. I told her “I know your pregnant but I’m not making dumplings for you”. She started having a rage that I wouldn’t cook her something. It was 6pm at night I’m not whipping out all this ingredients. I told her to make it herself or to not have anything. 

When I had my pizza she was sitting on the couch sobbing saying that I don’t love her or the baby. I told her I’ll make dumplings tomorrow night for her but not tonight. She told me to fuck off somewhere else. I asked my friend if I could stay the night with him and he said yes. Packed clothes and slammed the door behind me. When I was half way to my friends my wife texted me begging for me to come back so I told her to fuck off like she did with me.

AITA for refusing to get rid of my two dogs for my husband's allergic love child,"My husband had a one night stand after much counseling I decided to forgive him and work on our marriage.

Unfortunately the woman got pregnant, and they now have a 3-year-old boy. 

I have two 5-year-old French bulldogs whom I and my two kids with my husband (14f and 9m). Unfortunately being short hair dogs these kind tend to produce the most reaction in those who are allergic.

I was fully prepared to welcome this child into my home with open arms and be the best stepmother I could possibly be, as the child is innocent and he is the little brother of my two children. My husband has visitation every other weekend.

Unfortunately this child is highly allergic to dogs, and his mother is demanding that we get rid of the dogs. These dogs have been with me through thick and thin, they were there with me when I suffered severe depression over my husband cheating and my kids adore them too. 

I absolutely refuse to get rid of these dogs, I told my husband he can either do the visitation at a hotel, get a second apartment for him and his son, or we can build an in-law unit at his expense above the garage but I told him my only stipulations are that this comes out of his own pocket he may not dip into our kids college funds and the dogs stay. 

Because the child is so young he doesn't understand why he's not allowed to come to the house and feels left out as a result.

I want to say thank you to everyone who commented and PMd me with advice after my first post almost 2 months ago. I received a lot of helpful advice that I took into consideration when planning what to do next. 

A week after my post, I ended up moving in with a friend who was kind enough to let me stay and pay a very small amount in rent in return. I also ended up talking to my parents and my dad apologized for his behaviour and promised to never make a threat like that again, which honestly came as a shock to me but I’m glad things got resolved between us. I let them know that I am staying with a friend and paying a small amount in rent in the meantime and that I am in the process of finding an apartment and they suggested that I move back in with them for free until I find a job and a place so I took their offer and moved back home and haven’t had issues with them since moving back.

AITA for telling my (f26) friend (f26) that her degree is useless if she has to leave the country to find work?,"I have a high school friend, Diana, whom recently got her Masters degree. She lived in another city and we barely ever saw each other and she was always “too busy” for long phone calls so we only talked briefly every now and then. 

During the time she spent on her degrees, I managed to get married and start my own family. 

Diana was visiting her family and we met up for lunch. I asked her about her degree, work prospects, etc. (She did her masters in translation or interpreting or something like that) and she said she got the job but will have to move to Brussels. I told her that’s crazy. If she can’t find a job locally, then her degree was a waste of time if she has to move to another country.
She said it’s an amazing job opportunity that she couldn’t get anywhere around here (apparently the job is related to EU parliament or whatever, I admit it, I lost her with all the abbreviations she was using). 
She again said that it’s an amazing opportunity and she’s excited.
I asked her about the pay and she told me. I said that my husband earns that without a degree so I was right about the Easter of time and money, and she said it’s  starting salary and it’ll grow because the first year I saw pretty much training and being in a junior position.
I again said that she could’ve gotten a similar job here and wouldn’t have wasted 6 years Andy instead could’ve already work Andy start a family.
And here’s where she was rude, she said that if she was to be as unhappy as I was, she didn’t want a family’s. She threw in my face that apparently I’m always complaining about my husband but I’m criticising her, he’s the best husband in the world.

AITA for suggesting that my sister inlaw is lying about burying my brother inlaw's wedding ring with him?,"
Basically, my brother inlaw (my husband's brother) passed away from cancer 2 weeks ago. His widow/wife aka sister inlaw has never really been on good terms with my inlaws/her inlaws. They were having issues in the past and now from what I gather, my mother inlaw is planning on going to court for grandparents rights to get visitation of the kids.


My inlaws had been asking my sister inlaw to give them my brother inlaw's wedding ring so they could keep it. She refused and they got into a huge argument then she left with the kids. They went over to her home yesterday hoping to take the ring from her but she told them she didn't have it, and that she buried it with my brother inlaw. When my parents inlaw mentioned this and were devastated, I suggested that she might just be lying to get them to drop it. Suddenly, they got up and quickly got into their cars and went over to her house and had another huge argument there. Sister inlaw called me later cussing at me saying I was horrible to be basically meddling in her life and encouraging my inlaws to come after her and harrass her. I argued that I only made a suggestion and that her real issue was with them. She hung up after telling me to mind my own business and stop getting involved. My husband berated me for what I said and said that his parents are crazy, and that I shouldn't approve of their behavior or even help them harrass my grieving sister inlaw. I mean my parents inlaw are also grieving and I, too, am grieving and my sister inlaw's words hurt me when all I did was just make a suggestion when I saw how devastated my parents inlaw were.

AITA for returning my husband's birthday gift to pay for the birthday cake my daughter baked after he refused to pay her?,"

Basically the title. My daughter (16) has a thing for baking, she bakes cakes and some (I said some not all!) sweets and makes money out of it by selling her work to relatives, friends and supposedly us!


My husband's (Her stepdad) 45th birthday took place days ago. He asked my daughter to bake him the birthday cake and she agreed. I told him about paying her to which he responded with ""pfff pay her? Get outta here, I'm her dad!"". I insisted seeing she's ""a yes"" person and a people's pleaser so won't outright demand the money from him. He said he'd pay but days went by and he didn't pay her a cent.


 I decided to go ahead and sell the wrist watch I bought him as his birthday cake and pay her for her. He foubd out and went off on me. I told him he had rnough time and shouldve paid her seven before he recieved the cake. He said that I was teaching her to treat familial relationship as ""transactional"" and raiding her to be ""materialistic"". I explained the time, effort and even money she put towards making the cake but he lashed out verbally calling me an asshlle for making this move and for enabling my daughter to expect so much from family that she's supposed to help with nothing in return.


He's furious and told almost the whole family about how I took back his birthday gift and returned it. I got enough shame from family members to begin to think that I might be an asshole for how I dealt with this.

He told me it was not OK for me to take medication infront of his kids...I was like ""up why not??"" And he started ranting about how his kids shouldn't see ""this stuff"" and that I should of went to my room or any other room to take my medication if ""it was so important to me"". I was shocked and mom didn't even say anything at the time which rlly got me questioning what I did. He then said those are my stepsubkings, they're of young age and should not be ""exposed"" to such ""sights"" and that I'm gon' have to come up with a better way to ""deal"" with my condition and medication intake because he doesn't want his kids exposed to that once we all start living together as a""family"". I told him it wasn't my problem which caused the argument to escalated. Mom sided with him and I had to go to my room to calm down a bit.

After he and his kids left, mom picked another argument with me saying I should of been more consuderate"" of the kids seeing my medication and said that Jeff has a point but I was being too rude to him. She told me she's expecting me to apologize and get right with Jeff next time he visits but I said no.

Update AITA for refusing to leave my friend’s baby shower just because my “ex” didn’t want her boyfriend to see me?,"[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/uajnfc/aita_for_refusing_to_leave_my_friends_baby_shower/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

Damm I don’t know what to say . But everyone *really* wanted to know what happened. Gonna start of first & say I spoke to my friend who’s baby shower it was to apologize for the drama, I had no idea that was gonna happen. 

Just so she hears it from me first like a commenter suggested I do. She had no idea my ex and I had a past, but she told me it was fine. The party awkward after but that’s on them and she doesn’t blame me. It was great to hear because this was meant for her to celebrate her baby. And as her friend I wanted to be there celebrating with them. 

So I got all the confirmation from her (plus you guys 👍🏻) that I wasn’t TA. 

Obviously all of u want to know the answer to the main question if this baby was my kid or what was their deal after all.

 We did talk on the phone. She went first and beat me to that topic. Probably read my mind because she started off with telling me she had something important to talk about after apologizing for blaming me about the party. 

To sum it up we agreed to get a paternity test done asap because I couldn’t handle this curiosity it was already driving me crazy. 
He is definitely my kid. I’ve looked at the results a million times since they got back.

But she already knew my son was mine. She found out she was pregnant after i left. 

She didn’t want to tell me because when I went back for work she wasn’t told until after I’d already flew back. And that hurt her. Since it seemed like I didn’t care much she was scared i wouldn’t be willing to go back and help take care of our kid. 

This was hard for me to hear. I was actually crying when we talked about it in person. I’m still in shock learning this but she let me come meet him a day ago and it was emotional af. Holding him really got me. He’s so damm big already. That whole day I spent it with my son then we stayed up late talking about how we’re gonna do this then. This is new to me so we’re gonna go with the flow. But holy fuck I have a son!!! That’s so crazy right? 

Far as her boyfriend, seems like wasn’t cheating. At least from what she tells me and the little bit of info I got from him (which he was pissed about) They weren’t exclusive either but after she got pregnant he was only willing to be around as long as *I* wasn’t . And obviously seeing me pissed him off because he thought I was still living out of state. It’s a mess right now but he doesn’t wanna be around if I am. But my son is my kid. 

She told me not to worry about their relationship because the only thing she wanted was to make sure was my son had a dad in his life. Even if I’ve got no idea what I’m doing rn being his dad is what I want to be for him. We already missed on all this time. I’m excited to see him again tmrw",14668,ug0jfq,"Whoa!

AITA for refusing to give my husband money to go on the trip that his friend excluded me from?,"

My f35 husband m33 has a friend m32 ""Austin"" that he's known from college. They're like brothers and together they extended their friend group, now the group has over 7 guys who hang out together all the time.

Austin and I don't get along. He seems to be mocking my infertility and brings it up ocassionly. It hurts because I've always wanted children and for him to make it a constant topic of conversation hurts. My husband thinks it's just me being hypersensitive.

Anyway. About a month ago, Austin and I got into a fight after he commented on my infertility by saying that I should hurry up and give HIM a nephew/niece because ""my biological clock is ticking"". We were planning on going to a trip together but Austin disinvited me because I yelled at him for what he said and ""ruined"" his dinner. I said I was perfectly OKAY with that, in fact I felt so much relief I no longer had to be around him anymore. My husband for the first time was okay with me being away from Austin but said he still wants to go on that trip. I said nothing til he told me he still expects me to pay for his travel expenses. I refused and said he was on his own. He started an argument about how I'm doing this to punish him for not staying home with me and told me that my issue was with Austin not him. I told him he could go get the money elsewhere but he's unable to borrow anymore money and add to his debts after he got fired in May.


 He insisted and I refused. He started calling me spiteful and unfair to refuse to pay for his travel expenses as an attempt tj get him to stay home with me. He said his relationship with Austin is bigger than just few comments Austin made and bigger than my exaggerated sensitivity and insecurity.

Now he's sulking until I cave in and give him the money.

AITA for not letting my daughter buy clothes?," 

My wife (37f) and I (37m) have 4 kids (14f and 14m, 12m, and 11f), we generally agree on parenting them, but a recent incident had me and my wife disagreeing and I want to see if I was in the wrong.

A few weeks ago, I was at home with our 12 y/o because he was sick with a stomach bug. While I was making him soup, I got a call from my twin’s high school, telling me that they wanted to speak with me, and that my daughter had received 3 days of ISS for a bullying incident. Because of my son’s sickness, I spoke through them via phone and they told me everything that had happened, my daughter and a group of her friends was picking on a boy for wearing a crop top, the boy told the teacher, she asked them to stop, when they didn’t stop, she sent them to the office. After talking to the boy, he admitted the bullying was going on for a few days, and that they kept bothering him when he asked them to stop.

My daughter and son came home and my son’s face was bright red. I told my daughter to go to her room and then sat down with my son to see if he was okay. Apparently the boy she bullied was a close friend of his, one of his football teammates. The boy was talking to my son and their other friends and said something about how he thought it was cool that some men used to wear sports crop tops. The boys told him if he thought it was cool, he should try it. The boys went out and bought some jerseys from the thrift store and made them into crop tops. 

I then spoke to my daughter, she didn’t show much remorse and was dismissive of me, last year she also got in trouble for bullying someone bc of clothing, she’s also gotten in trouble for racism at school (very white area, we are white, her and her friends were saying racist stuff in class). When my wife got home, we discussed a punishment and agreed on not buying her new clothes for a while, she has plenty of good clothes already.

This weekend, we went to visit my brother. My brother lives around 3 hours away in a small town and we don’t see him often. This week was the town’s annual fair. At the fair, they had booths from local businesses. 

Our oldest son went to the booth with antique sports stuff and then the book booth to get books on sports history (son loves reading those), our 12 y/o got some plushies and toys and our youngest was looking at video games.

Our oldest daughter went to the clothes, I stopped her and told her the rule was still in place. I said she could buy books, a video game, candy, ect, but clothes were the one thing she could not get. She was bugging my wife and my wife eventually told her she would reconsider it, she then talked to me and I told her that I wasn’t changing my stance because I am letting her buy other stuff and I thought she was being entitled, my daughter didn’t buy anything and my wife thinks I was too tough on her. When I called my mom for advice, she also agreed with my wife, AITA?",14662,y6dq3u,"Too tough?

AITA for telling my sister in law that im pregnant at her engagement party?," I know this seems bad but hear me out please

 I'm (24f) 4 months pregnant. My husband (29m) and I are very excited and we can't wait to be parents. We decided not tell people till the week after the party. 

 My in-laws own a winery and it's beautiful. It's where my sil (let's call her Taylor) got engaged at and the engagement party was. I'm known for loving wine (I'm not an alcoholic) but I like a glass of wine while out but with a glass of water for the rest of the outing. 

 So at the engagement party, I was drinking water and talking to my in laws when Taylor offer me a glass of wine. I told her that I don't feel like drinking. She kept offering me and I kept refusing. I made up so many excuses till she ask if I was pregnant as a joke. I nervously smile and tried to walk away. She screamed that I ruined her engagement party for telling her that I'm pregnant.

AITA for refusing to pay to get his car fixed from my college fund?,"Me (f22) and this guy (m27) ""Paul"" have been going out on few dates for 2 months (we met on tinder) We really like each other but haven't officially started dating yet, so I don't call him BF and vice versa. We're still getting to know each other and the things we love vs hate.

So for the past couple of weeks he's been sending me pics of his car that has been sitting in the mechanic (his cousin's) shop for weeks. He went on and on about what needs fixing and made a long list and calculated the total then sent it to me as a screenshot. I looked at it wondering what is have to do with me? He told me about his financial hardship atm and asked if I could help pay for his car to get it fixed quickly, so he'll be able to take me on that roadtrip he promised. I felt uncomfortable bc the money he was talking about was around 2.5k and I don't have that kind of money on my hand. He brought up my college fund and suggested I skip one semester so I could pay for the car. I was shocked he brought that up, idk he knows how important college is for me but he assured me he'll pay me back on time and that I only have to skip one semester and that's it. I asked for time to think about it but after he kept calling I decided to just give a polite ""NO"". He asked why and I told him it's because my education is my priority and I can't handle skipping a semster, even if it's one. He hung up saying he needed time then texted me saying that I did not show support after he made himself open and vulnerable, and that I chose money over him by refusing to lend it to him, and that he is struggling and in need and that didn't matter to me. I felt really guilty and I started calling him but he texted me saying that he might respond when I make room for a compromise.

AITA for not returning my engagement ring after my fiancee past away?,"First time posting, sorry if I made any mistakes.

I (31F) recently lost my fiancee (37M) Jake. We've been together for 6 years. His death was unexpected and I'm still mourning.

At the funeral (which I arranged and paid for) his brother (32M) Jim asked me when I'm going to return the engagement ring to the family. 

For context, the engagement ring with which Jake proposed is an ancient family heirloom. It's a gorgeous ring but what makes it priceless is the story behind it. Jake got the ring from his grandma a month after we started dating, he claimed he knew back then he would marry me some day and wanted to get his grandma's blessings on the ring. When he proposed his grandma already passed away so having the blessings put on the ring made it extra special for the both of us. 

I asked Jim if he's serious to which he said yes, apparently his long term girlfriend Stacy saw the ring a while ago and fell in love with it and the story behind it so she kept nagging him to get her something similar, which he couldn't. He figured since I can no longer marry Jake he can propose to Stacy with it. I told him that he is rude, that the ring was blessed especially for Jake and I in mind, and even if that wasn't the case bringing it up during Jakes funeral is incredibly disrespectful. 

After the funeral I got a massage from Stacy saying it would mean the world for her to be the new owner of the ring and I could always think of her and Jims wedding as the bittersweet ending to my relationship. She said the ring was blessed so one of the grandsons can marry the love of his life, and since Jim is the only living grandson left he has a claim to it. I blocked her. 

My ex MIL also reached out to me and said that although she understands my pain I can't keep the ring since its a family heirloom, so I should suck it up and give it to Jim. I snapped and told her no, the ring is staying with me and following me to the grave if need be. It's a beautiful symbol of Jakes love and I won't let Jim and Stacy sully that memory of him. 

The ring is legally mine so all they can do is cry about it and be bitter. They keep harassing me on social media saying I'm a bad person and that I stole the family heirloom to spite Jim and Stacy out of jealousy but I ignore them.

Today I met up with my brother and he said that although Jims approach was highly inappropriate, I'm being selfish for keeping the ring as a keep sake. I could always wear different jewelry that Jake bought me in his memory but they could never replace an heirloom that's been in their family for generations.

I'm now back home and I can't stop thinking about it, up until this point I was sure I did everything right but maybe I'm just being blinded by my grief.

A friend suggested I ask for an objective opinion and recommend this place, so AITA?

UPDATE: I'm writing this to answer some commonly asked questions and because I think I've made up my mind on what to do with the ring.

1) I met Jakes grandma, she passed away a year before our engagement and by that time I was already introduced to the family. 

2) We were supposed to get married on 31/10/2022, we met during a Halloween party so we thought it was fitting. My brother helped me cancel the wedding venue and catering since I didn't have the heart to do it.

3) We don't have children, due to personal reasons we never planned on having any biological kids. However we did plan on adopting/fostering after our marriage was finalized. 

4) Stacy did mention a couple of times how gorgeous my engagement ring is and asked if she could try it on, I refused. Back then I thought she was just trying to hint to Jim he should propose already, didn't think she was actually interested in the ring itself. 

5) The ring is legally mine, in Jakes will I'm written as the beneficiary, the will was written 2 years ago and hasn't been changed since. 

6) Jake passed away in a work related accident, I claimed the life insurance plus sued the company he worked at since I believe his death was due to their negligence and could've been avoided. I'm currently in a legal battle with the company.

7) I paid for the funeral because I wanted to make sure everything was organized the way Jake would have wanted it. As horrible as it sounds, I was financially well off before Jakes death and now due to his will, life insurance and company compensation I'm practically rich. So I had the funds to organize him a really nice funeral.

8) When I told ex MIL I'll take the ring to my grave I meant it. When Jake passed I considered joining him a couple of times before finally starting going to therapy. I don't think I'll ever date or get engaged again, it's too painful.

9) As for my decision, I would rather wait for hell to freeze over then let Stacy and Jim get the ring. 

For now the ring is staying with me. 

However I am considering the following option:

Jake has one cousin (10F) that lives far away, I used to babysit her while her parents still lived in town. I think I'll gift her the ring after she graduates HS and pay for her college tuition using the life insurance money I got, I hope that way I can do right by both Jake and his grandma. They say time heals, hopefully 8 years will be enough for me to let go of the ring, if not, I guess we'll see then.

I'm not telling anyone in his family what I have planned, let them think they've lost the ring forever. I think it's a punishment fit for their actions. 

Btw: I lost the comment that said this but someone compared Stacy to Gollum, I don't know who it was but this genuinely made me laugh for the first time in a while, thank you.",14657,tkv50u,"You were family enough to pay for the funeral.

AITA for refusing to take down my daughter's graduation photo and replace it with my husband's graduation photo?,"
My daughter (18) graduated high school and I hung a photo of her graduation party on the living room wall. She wants to go to a community college and we'll live with me and her stepdad while doing that.


My husband recently earned his master's degree and yesterday, he showed me his graduation photo that he framed and prepared to hung. I asked where we were gonna hang it and he said the living room. I said ""great! right next to Amy's graduation photo then"". He said not next to it but instead of it. I was puzzled I asked why and he said that he didn't feel it was right having his graduation photo, a master's degree be hung next to a high school graduation photo, a high school degree. He said that both photis have ""different weight and value"" and suggested I take my daughter's photo down and hang his instead. I was fuming because he refused to let her photo be hung anywhere near his and by that he has claimed the entire wall. I refused and sais this photo has been here for months! and my daughter desrves to have it on display for encouragement. He got upset and said that I was making it a big deal and could instead just use the hallway hall or something but I refused.


We had an argument about it and he kept insisting on having her graduation photo be taken down and not be hung on the same wall as his due to difference in degree value and weight and also he thought that a highschool photo isn't hang-on wall worthy and called me inconsiderate of his feelings. he says it's disrespectful to him and his efforts and said that I' choosing this ""hill"" to die on was ridiculous.

The thing is, he isn‘t even Spanish! He was born here but lived on Spain since he was 4 until he was 19. Now, if he had some sort of cultural or family connection to Spain then I might consider it. But he is American!

When he initially told me at around 21 weeks I thought he was joking so I let it go, but now that he brought it up again I told him how I felt about it.

I told him what I told you guys above and that it would be hard for her because they are very different languages.

Why are you so against this. Spanish is an extremely common language and would be a benefit.

AITA for refusing to kiss my husband's wound?,"Throwaway for privacy.

Background: Whenever my 9 years old son gets injured or hurt, I'd normally kiss the injured area as a way to comfort him and make the pain go away, I also use it as source of strength and he certainly sees it this way. I DO NOT kiss the skin directly but after I cover the injured area obviously.



My 35 year old husband got into an accident and had an injury (wound) on the left part of his chest. He has 0 pain tolerance but he takes medication for it.

The other day I was helping change his wound dressing and clean up the wound, before I could place the new wound dressing he asked me to kiss it. I refused.  it just didn't feel right, his wound was still fresh and there was already antibiotic ointment applied there so I just didn't want to do it.

He insisted and I kept declining, He then got made and said that I do this with my son why not him. I suggested that we just let it go and proceeded to apply the new wound dressing. he stopped me and went on a long vent about how I don't care about him and that I clearly feel grossed out by him to not want to kiss his wound. I thought that was silly, I told him to let me finish changing the wound dressing but started arguing and had me leave the room. I left and he kept sulking for the rest of the night. he then told me son that mommy doesn't love daddy and don't want to kiss his wound so he could get better. I was floored, my son actually came at me for upsetting my husband and just made me feel bad all around.


I kept thinking that I caused this situation and should've just done what he wanted me instead of creating this tension in the house.

AITA for forcing out a fart to get my mom to stop asking my girlfriend invasive questions infront of the whole family?,"
I know what it sounds like but I swear it's a desperate situation.

So I (23M) have been with my girlfriend (22F) for 7 months. She has a visible scar on her neck and she hates to be asked about it and hates to tell.the story behind it (believe it or not I don't have the story yet but I'm waiting til she's comfortable to share) She met my family several times and of course...mom and aunts askee her about her scar...like 3-4 times in just a couple of hours, then on dinner, then during movie time. etc It got bothersome and my girlfriend would look uncomfortable and I could just tell that the question itself brings her sadness. I told my mom to stop asking such invasive questions about the scar and every time she'd say ""okay, won't ask I promise"" but then she would turn around and do it again.


On mother's day my girlfriend and I attended dinner at mom's. We where sitting in the living room and my mom goes to ask my girlfriend about the scar again, this time with a bigger audience because the whole family was there. My girlfriend said she'd rather not talk but mom kept cornering her and kept asking her in yes/no form. I was sitting next to mom and forced a loud fart in an attempt to take pressure and attention away from my girlfriend and get mom to switch her focus to something else. I was like ""woohps"" and the family started laughing. mom turned to me and gave me a nasty stare. it got awkward ngl but I was desperate and couldn't really yell at mom to stop and start a fight on mother's day so I thought of this instead of making a scene.

She pulled me into the kitchen and scolded me for what I did after I admitted that I did it intentially. She called me childish and said that if I didn't want her to bring up my girlfriend's scar then I should've said but I did!!!! I swear like a 100 times. Anyways My girlfriend and I left and my girlfriend couldn't stop laughing in the car.

AITA for calling the police after my brother dropped off his two kids at my workplace?,"
My m31, brother m36 is a single (widowed) dad of 2 kids (my nephews) both under the age of 10. He used to have babysitters but ever since he met his new girlfriend he stopped hiring any help because his girlfriend claimed that she wanted the kids to warm up to and get used to her as the only woman in their life (?wtf?).


So he started asking me to watch the boys whenever he had something to do. I'd help if I'm able but I work a demanding job and need to cover full time. He for whatever reason refuses to acknowledge that.


Days ago, he was going for lunch with his girlfriend to meet her friends and wanted me to have the boys. I told him I had to work but he begged me to take the day off. I refused and went to work. At 11a.m a coworker of mine entered the office and behind him were my nephews. I was flabbergasted he told me my brother dropped them off so they coulld stay with me. I was in a state of disbelief but also furious. I felt stuck and terrified my boss would see this and I get in trouble. I couldn't even take time off because of how busy I was. Out of frustrration I called the police and explained what happened. They got ahold of my brother and he wss forced to come take them off me as well as get into trouble with the authorties who spent hours talking to him. My bkss eventually found out and I had to leave work early and go home.


In the evening, my brother called and started screaming at me calling me names of all sorts and saying that I not only ruined his meeting with his girlfriend and her friends, but caused him to get in trouble with the police. He called me a vile SOB and said that I could've had the kids with me for a couple of hours or even took them home and took the rest of the day off.

She believes this will keep them from partying, having premarital sex, etc. I don’t agree with this and have argued my children getting the best education possible regardless of the school’s religious affiliation should be her top priority, but she refuses to change her mind. My son chose a Christian college one state over to attend. He graduated with a lot of college credit from taking many AP classes in high school and will be done in three years opposed to four. He’s currently just began year two which has been already paid for.

During Labor Day weekend, he came home to celebrate his grandmas birthday. He told one of his cousins that he was talking to a boy at his college, and thought he could trust him. He seemed supportive according to my son, but he told his mom and dad and my husband’s sister and her husband are just are religious as my mother in law and outted my son to her. She is livid and called me and informed me she will not be making any future payments toward his tuition and told me to relay the message to him as she will no longer be speaking to him. I have told him many times not to come out to his grandma, cousins, aunt or uncle until he was through with college. I hate that he can’t be himself, but my husband and I cannot afford his college. I don’t like my mother in law and will be going no contact once my other two children(15f and 13m) get their chance to have their tuition paid for as well. My son is okay with me waiting to do so for the sake of his siblings. He will unfortunately have to take out student loans and eat the cost of his final year.

My son is obviously devastated he both will not have his final year of college paid for next year and that his cousin is not someone he can trust. He now wants me and my husband to foot the bill next year. We have $25k saved up currently that we plan on using for much needed kitchen renovations. Our oven barely works, our dishwasher doesn’t work at all, and the kitchen itself is worn down and outdated. My son is calling me an asshole for prioritizing to a “remodel” over his education. We’ve explained to him our kitchen is falling apart and it’s much needed and is nowhere near the cost of his tuition, so even if we postponed it, we would still be short as his private school is VERY expensive. I feel like he is an adult and he needs to be the one to deal with the consequences, not us. AITA for not using our family’s savings to cover his remaining tuition?

EDIT: I feel like I should clear up the kitchen remodel. Obviously appliances alone aren’t going to cost me $25k. The majority of money are going to be going to necessary infrastructure repairs. I live in an expensive area, and yes, this is what it costs to fix just the necessities . My kitchen will in no way be fancy. I should have been more clear in the original post that I am not doing remodel for aesthetics.",14618,xiuwgp,"I know this will get lost in the replies but honestly tell your son to transfer schools for his last year to save on tuition. Sure he won't get his fancy private education but he will get an education and for far less than private schools. Most states if you are from the state has in state tuition as cheaper. I didn't even go to a four year college and I still know that. Don't let your son be entitled, I too come from a family of means, my brother got the full ride plus an allowance at a private school. Meanwhile I was disabled and put myself through community College after my family disowning me at a young age and telling me I'm on my own with medical bills and what not, I still rose to the occasion and so should your son.",39,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/xiuwgp/aita_for_refusing_to_pay_from_my_gay_sons_tuition/
AITA for not letting my SIL wear my wedding dress?,"Throwaway because my husband and some other family know my normal Reddit. 

My (28F) husband (30M) have been married for almost six years now. At the time of our engagement, neither of us had much money, so there was no way I could have afforded the wedding dress that I wanted to wear. Thankfully for me, my mother is something of a seamstress, and offered to help me make my dream dress. We spent over a year finding the pattern, picking the fabrics, and making my beautiful wedding dress completely from scratch. It’s the first big project I’ve ever sewn, so I’m quite proud of it. Making it also brought me much closer to my mother, as the whole project was sort of a bonding experience. It also holds a lot of additional sentimental value as my dad passed away while we were making it, so I sewed a heart shaped cutout of one of his shirts into the lining of the dress in order to keep him with me on my big day. This dress not only brought me closer to my husband, but my family too. It means so much to me.

My SIL (F23) just got engaged recently, and is in a similar situation with her wedding. She just got out of college and started work as a teacher. Between her loans and a relatively low salary, she doesn’t have very much money to pay for her wedding. Dress shopping has been a bit stressful for her, as all the dresses that fit her taste are just so far out of her budget. This all leads up to Tuesday morning, when she called up my husband and asked if I would be willing to let her borrow my dress. She mentioned that it could be her “something borrowed.” My husband says that he would have to ask me first, because it wasn’t his to loan out. His sister told him that it wouldn’t be a problem and I’d barely miss it as it was just sitting in a box anyway. He still said he would have to ask me and forgot about it. He finished his work day and picked me up from my job and we came home to his little sister trying on my wedding dress and his mom clipping it in the back to fit her better. Seeing somebody else in my dress totally blindsided me. I was stunned and asked what they were doing, and my MIL said that they were planning alterations since SIL is significantly smaller than me. I told them that there is no way I would be loaning my dress out to anyone. It not only represents my love to my husband, but the bond with some of my family as well. This escalated into an argument that ended in my MIL calling me a selfish bitch and leaving with SIL. My husband thankfully grabbed the dress during the argument so they didn’t grab it when they left. I was really upset, but thought about it after I had some time to call down. I don’t have any uses for my dress, and I do love my SIL. I feel as if I maybe overreacted and shut them down too quickly. AITA?

TLDR: My SIL wants to borrow my homemade wedding dress and tried it on without my knowledge. I freaked and said no.

Edit: By “clipping” I meant using binder clips to secure excess fabric. They didn’t actually damage my dress.",14618,t2expt,"They aren’t just borrowing it and giving it back as is, they want to alter it. It has sentimental value.

AITA for sending my son to school with less food and explicitly telling him not to share with his best friend?,"This situation began a year ago and blew up in our faces last week.

My son Gregory is 13 years old. He just began the 8th grade. His friend, Peter, is also 13 and began the 8th grade too.

Gregory and Peter have been friends since elementary school. Last year, I noticed that Gregory would be ravenously hungry after school every day. He would come home and eat a frozen dinner or something, and then help himself to seconds at dinner time. I chalked this up to him being a 12-year-old boy and let it be.

Something about the situation was nagging at me though, and while Gregory wasn't clear about why at first, he eventually came clean. Peter was being sent to school every day with no lunch. It looks to me like a typical case of neglectful and unfit parents. The one time that Gregory went to their house he came home with comments about it smelling really bad and his Peter's parents locking themselves in the garage for hours.

Feeling bad for Peter, I decided to discretely begin giving Gregory more food every day, just about doubling all his food. Over time I became less discrete and began packing a separate lunch for Peter. I was never thanked for this by anyone, but I knew Peter was eating the food I sent.

This year, things are different. Money is tighter for personal reasons and frankly with how expensive things are, I have decided not to spend exorbitant amounts of money supporting someone else's child. I sat Gregory down and told him that I would be packing him one lunch which is for him and him alone. I made it extremely clear: do not share with anyone, and this includes Peter. 

Gregory followed my instructions until one day last week I got a phone call from Peter's mother. She was livid that I had cut Peter off without a single word. I asked her when it became my responsibility to feed her son, and she responded that if she had known I wasn't sending Gregory to school with ""too much food,"" she would have handled it herself. I asked if she remembered why I began sending him to school with two lunches in the first place and she hung up on me.

I feel conflicted. I know I'm having my kindness thrown back in my face, but did I approach this situation incorrectly?",14614,xmh9cm,"Info- have you gone to the school

AITA for refusing to pay my sister for house sitting after she failed to feed my birds?,"I’m (25M) really upset about what she did. I needed to fly out from California to Washington because my dad had surgery from an accident and I wanted to be there to help out my stepmom with him for a few days. I was gone for a week and asked my sister if she could come over once a day to water my plants, check my mail.

 I also have (or had) 2 blue parakeets that I love. Male and female. The female was ready to lay her eggs so I already had a nest for them in their cage. Before my trip she was already sitting on her eggs in the nest and I told my sister to ALWAYS make sure to clean their cup of bird food and add more in everyday and keep their water clean. 

This was explained to her twice because I wanted to make sure the birds and the eggs would be okay. The male would be bringing food for the female to eat while she’s sitting on the eggs so that’s why I wanted to be sure she would follow what I said. Also clean out the tray in their cage. 

Everyday since leaving I asked her did the birds have food, was their water clean, etc. She told me yes, everytime so nothing to worry about. Finally got back last night. First thing was to check on my birds. Yeah the cage was clean and their water was too but guess what, all that was in their food cup was trash from the seeds they already ate. The mother bird was….you know. And obviously the eggs didn’t survive either. The only one that was still alive was the male but he looked so sad. 

First thing I noticed was that he was right on top of the nest box looking inside. Can’t tell you how much I was crying taking them out. She had 6 eggs and she died still trying to incubate their babies.

 My sister claimed their cup was always full so she assumed she didn’t need to put more food in. Despite telling her to refill their cup with MORE food. Because they had nothing. She keeps saying it was an honest mistake and she didn’t mean for them to die. And now I’m refusing to pay her the $200 I promised to drive here everyday because she didn’t follow everything instructed. She did everything else except this one thing so it’s not fair to refuse paying her. Calling me petty and shitty brother after doing me a favor for taking the time out of her days now only to not give her money she needs. 

I’m still really sad/angry about my birds so that’s why I feel like she doesn’t deserve anything for being the one responsible. But maybe I am? Or who knows. AITA?",14594,tx2klh,"I also want to add that if the food bowl looked full every day and that’s why she didnt replace the food (even though you can tell whats seed and whats husk), thats still her fault. If she believed the birds needed food every day but never needed to top it up, she should have been concerned and contacted you to say, hey, your birds food is still full so it looks like they might not be eating.

AITA for telling my mom to remove/change a tattoo?,"I (17ftm) am trans and came out to my family a few months ago. All in all, everyone has been supportive, although I believe my mom was a tiny bit bummed. She said she would always support me, though. She just needs time to process all of this. Which is honestly painful. But not the reason why I'm here.

My mom got a tattoo with my sister's name and my dead name after I was born. It's a huge tattoo with a unique design that incorporates her and my dead name. It covers most of her arm, and she is really proud of it because my old sister designed it and gifted it to her for her birthday. 

Obviously, constantly seeing my dead name is kind of triggering to me. Therefore, I told her she needs to remove it. 
She seemed shocked and told me she's too old for longer tattoo sessions. She hasn't gotten a tattoo in years, bc of that. She also was diagnosed with depression and such and uses it as an excuse for not having the energy to change it anymore. I don't really believe her, but whatever.

Now she is often trying to cover it up with clothes, but I feel like it's not enough. Just the knowledge that that... name is still there, it haunts me. 
But she refuses to change it. We had a lot of fights because of it, and she said that she is really trying to hide it, but it's a part of her body that she is in love with, bc there is so much history and love for her children in that tattoo. I can't really relate, because I don't have any particularly significant tattoos. 

Now, my birthday was a few days ago and some family came over, and the issue came up, bc my cousin was showing off her new tattoo and someone asked about the dead name tattoo. 
My mom got uncomfortably silent and excused herself and went to the kitchen. 
So, everyone started asking me what that was about, and I told them that I wanted her to remove the tattoo, but she doesn't want to. My sister also doesn't want her to, bc she believes it would look really awful, since the entire design is attached to the names and the only way to cover it would be to just make her entire arm black.

Anyway, I didn't actually plan for that reaction, but my cousin (who can relate a bit bc she's queer) for some reason got furious and went after my mom and screamed at her for being so unsupportive and accused her of being transphobic. Which I don't believe, although it was nice to see someone get angry about the tattoo, bc my cousin was finally saying some things I was feeling, but I didn't want to put into words. 
My mom then had a panic attack and left the house. She is now staying with my grandpa, and my dad and my sister are angry at me for making some of my family gang up on her. AITA?

Edit: I read most of your comments and I tried apologizing to my mom, but she's currently NC. There's more stuff happening, especially with my cousin, but I don't know how updating works. I'll try to post one once I figure out how.

PS. I showed this to my sister as well and she wants me to say thanks to you all and she wholeheartedly agrees with everyone who says that I'm TA.",14593,wnfqjj,YTA. You have the right to change your body and your life so that you may walk through the world comfortable in your own skin. It would be hypocritical to take that same right away from your mother - and asking her to change or coverup her tattoo would be doing just that.,8139,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/wnfqjj/aita_for_telling_my_mom_to_removechange_a_tattoo/
AITA for holding a grudge against my dad who took my step siblings to Paris but not me?,"A few weeks ago I learned from my step brother's TikTok that my dad, step mom and two step brothers are in Paris. I was staying with my mom at the time. I'm F16 and would have loved to be there but they didn't even tell me they were going.

I immediately sent a text to my dad asking if they're enjoying their time in Paris and despite reading it he didn't reply until late at night. Then he tried to play dumb and said it's great and he wished I could be there. YEAH ME TOO! So I replied that he could have taken me and he said it wasn't possible and we'll talk about it later.

So when they returned I told them that I'm hurt that they didn't take me. My dad took me aside and told me that their finances are very tight, this vacation was a gift from step mom's parents and they only bought it for my dad, their daughter and their own grandchildren and not me. He reminded me that I shouldn't act in an entitled way. They were effectively guests (even though the grandparents weren't there, they just paid for it) and I wasn't invited so I shouldn't act in an entitled way.

I wasn't convinced, they could have refused to go without me, paid for me themselves, gone somewhere cheaper, stayed a little less longer, or asked my mom to pitch in (and she would have). Me not being there was exclusionary. If this was only about money they could have made it work. So I told my dad that I was disappointed in him.

So came last night and my step mom's parents came over for dinner. The subject of the vacation came up and everyone was takibg about it and I was just sitting there being quiet until I thanked them for doing such a nice thing for the ""family"" while my dad looked at me in a frowny way. Everyone went quiet, my dad tried explaining that I should have understood that this was a very expensive gift, I'm acting like an entitled brat and should go to my room if I can't behave myself. I said it doesn't seem like I belong anyway and told them to enjoy ""your"" family dinner and left. 

Later the grandmother came to my room and tried explaining that they gifted this to their grandchildren and couldn't afford to include me as well. She said they initially only had a budget for 3 (their daughter and grandchildren) but stretched themselves to 4 to include my dad as well, but while they wished they could have done it for me to they could really not stretch it to 5.

So I told her my problem is with my dad and I have no beef with her, but she doesn't get to act like she cares about me either and it's ok. I was like ""I'm a stranger to you and you don't care about me, so have some balls, put your big girl pants on and wear it on your sleeve"" and asked her to get the F out of my room. She left and I heard her telling my dad that I was very rude to her, so I'm grounded until further notice.

Am I acting like an entitled brat and AITA in this situation?

Edit: Not that it's relevant, but step grandmother's comment about trying to include me but not being able to work out the budget was nonsense, they're very rich and this was an excuse and she was taking me for a fool. But this is not relevant to me holding a grudge against my dad, I'm only specifying it for clearity.",14589,wbzp0z,"To the people who say OP is the AH or ESH, Can I just point out the degree of lying and omission that took place to keep this from OP?

There’s a LOT of planning for a vacation like that, not to mention packing.  There was plenty of opportunity for dad to talk to OP about this. She was excluded. Period. She shouldn’t have cursed at step grandma but then, the lady should have stayed out of the conversation. OP is 16- can you imagine how she felt when she saw that post?

AITA for accepting my family's Christmas invitation despite my husband being upset?,"


I [F32] I met this wonderful man 'Philip"" [M36] 2 years ago. We got married 4 months ago. For context, I have a 10 yo son ""Billy"" from my previous relationship and my ex isn't in the picture.


I have to admit that Philip's relationship with my family isn't so great. They would disagree on a lot of things. For example, he had an argument with my dad when he said that he was keeping their grandson away from them but Philip stated he wasn't and that he couldn't visit with Billy because he had work (I was sick at the time).


The latest argument was what made things worse. My mom and sister were discussing natural remedies (they're into this stuff) for my niece and Philip (he's a pediatrician) called both of them ""ignorant"" for not using meds instead which caused a huge argument and Philip being no longer welcome at my parents house.


Now they'd sent me and Billy an invitation for Christmas but did not include Philip which, I expected given how strained their relationship has become. I called my mom to confirm that I'll attend but the minute Philip found out, he went off saying he could not believe I was fine with my family excluding him and then agree to go and leave him behind. I told him it's their celebration and I don't get to decide their guestlist for them. And also, I'm not leaving him behind because we did not have any plans for Christmas. He said he thought that we'd ""automatically"" celebrate together the 3 of us but now I'm taking Billy away from him as well. I thought that was a bit melodramatic because it's literally just few hours at my parents home but he insisted it was about principle and respect. We had a big argument and I said that he basically alienated himself by continually picking arguments with my family, but he started ranting saying it wasn't about the fact that they didn't invite him, but the fact that I was willing to let him spend Christmas alone without me and Billy.


We went back and forth on the issue but do not seem to reach a solution. My parents are used to spending every major holiday with Billy. So you can see how much pressure I'm getting from both sides here.",14576,yz9veg,"YTA. You're right - you don't get to decide their guestlist for them.

AITA for telling my sister that she overreacted when screamed at me for entering hers and her husband's room?,"
So, I (f23) am a full time college student. Right now I'm living with my sister ""Claire"" and her husband ""Thomas"" while I get through my current semster.


I don't work so I don't have everything I need for my daily skin/hair routine so I borrow stuff from Claire. Claire didn't have an issue in the beginning but then started complaining about me randomly walking into her room but I go in there looking for the stuff I asked for. She gave me a hard time just because I walked in on Thomas half naked to get the eye shadow I borrowed from her. and then that other time when I walked in late at night. She told me I nedded to get her permission to enter the room before I take anything but I figured this would make things complicated. It's enough that I have to ask to borrow an item.


So, last night at around 10pm I went upstairs and into her bedroom to grab the hair dryer. I walked it and woops, I saw them in an intimate position together in bed. I had NO IDEA they're were doing it, especially since Claire told me that Thomas has been feeling sick the past 2 days. She lashed out at me yelling that I get out. I quickly grabbed the hair dryer then walked out and shut the door.


minutes later, She came downstairs in her robe and went off on me saying she was done with me repeatedly disrespecting and violating hers and her husband's privacy. I told her it was cool, no big deal. and that I needed the dryer but didn't have time to ask for permissin. She got even louder saying I had no business barging into her marital space and embarrassing her and her husband like this. I told her that I was sorry but she really overreacted to this whole thing. This made her more pissed she went on about how I'm living here rent free and yet not being respectable enough. I stopped arguing and went to my room.


This morning, Thomas left the house early amd Claire ignored me on breakfast. Still upset saying I don't get to say wether she overreacted or not and that my behavior was inappropriate.

AITA for refusing to change one of my students diapers outside of school hours.,"Hi everyone, I (20f) work full time at a daycare with younger preschoolers, a few of whom are still in diapers. The other day I was at huge a barbecue with some friends from high school and the friends of their parents were also there. I ran into one of my preschoolers and her mom and chatted with her for a little while. After a few minutes the mom said that her kids diaper was dirty and asked if I could change it. I thought she was joking so I laughed and made a joke back about how “I only change diapers when I’m on the clock.” Her friends that she was sitting with all kind of laughed awkwardly but she looked at me dead serious and said “no really I don’t change diapers.” I felt really awkward but just said “no, sorry” and went to walk away but then she started explaining to me that her husband is the only one who changes diapers because she’s a germaphobe and has emetaphobia (fear of throwing up) and she’s only done it a few times when she absolutely had to and she always threw up after which apparently she has a crippling fear of doing. I felt that regardless of the circumstances, it was inappropriate for her to ask me this so I said no again. 

She seemed really shocked by this and continued to explain how much she hates changing diapers and how her husband wasn’t here so he couldn’t help. I just told her that I don’t like changing them either and I think it’s inappropriate for her to keep pushing this when I have already told her no. She then said “it’s devastating to me to learn my daughter’s favorite teacher has so little empathy” and after that I just walked away. A few minutes later I saw her putting the kid in the car and leaving so I assume she went to wherever her husband was to have him do it. I texted my boss to tell her what happened because I am about to go on vacation and I assumed that the mother would say something to her about it. My boss just told me that I could tell her about it in more detail when I get back and she’d let me know if the mom said anything to her but it seemed like I was in the right in saying no. 

I don’t think I’m the AH in this situation. I am not her employee and even if I was I still think that’s not something you should ask someone to do outside of work hours. I do not know this mom well at all, we rarely talk at pickup or drop off and she was sitting at a table of her friends who I presume know about her situation and would’ve have been better people to ask for help. I think if she would rather let her kid sit in a dirty diaper for the car ride home instead of changing it herself, she shouldn’t be going places without her husband. The only part of this that makes me feel a little bit like an asshole is the fact that the kid had to sit in their own poop for the car ride home. I just assumed that once I left she would either ask one of her friends or suck it up and do it herself. 

So, am I the asshole?


Update + More context:
I was pretty sure I wasn’t the AH but thank you all for validating that. A lot of people have been asking about what her plan for going to this party possibly could’ve been and suggesting I call CPS to report neglect so I wanted to add some stuff. I probably should’ve said this the first time around but I’ve never posted here before. First, the school I work at is incredibly expensive and the parents are all incredibly wealthy so this kind of entitlement wasn’t completely surprising to me. Also I know this family has a nanny that occasionally drops the kid off and picks her up. I know she’s not a live-in nanny but my boss says she’s there enough of the time where she handles most diaper changes. Especially since the child is older and sleeps through the night. I do feel bad for the husband because he seems like a pretty nice guy but I don’t think he’s changing the kid much more than any normal parent because of the nanny. 

Secondly, I talked to my friends mom who was hosting the party. The mother was related to some people who were invited and it was kind of an “invite everyone you know type of thing”. Apparently her family usually handles it when she’s with them and her husbands not around so I assume her plan was to have them do it and then she ran into me and figured she didn’t need to bother her family anymore (who I’m sure are getting fed up with changing a child that is old enough to start potty training). Then once I said no she was too embarrassed to go ask someone else. 

Finally, to everyone saying I should call CPS. I talked to my boss (who is completely on my side btw) and we don’t think it’s necessary at this time. I truly believe she isn’t with the kid alone often enough for it to be a problem. The kid has never had any kind of serious diaper rash that would indicate she’s being left in a dirty diaper for long periods of time and though her mom does drop her off with a dirty diaper occasionally, it does seem like it happened in the car. For those of you who’ve never changed a diaper, you can kind of tell when it’s fresh vs. when it’s been sitting there for awhile. We are going to keep a close eye on it though and keep a record of stuff like this. Though I agree this mom has some serious issues, if it’s not causing any problems (no diaper rash) and it seems to be a very rare occasion, I don’t think it warrants a CPS call.",14572,tmnryk,"NTA, on paper this is a very simple answer, but I understand the guilt that you felt to have the kid sit in their dirty diaper on the way home (who knows how long the car ride was.)

That said, you are by no means obligated to help her out even if she's a germaphobe. If she can't change the diapers herself, that kid shouldn't be out of the house without someone that can. Nothing against the mother, but if she really can't change that diaper (even if no one else can) then maybe she shouldn't go out with her kid on her own.

Also question, has she ever dropped that child off at school with a dirty diaper? Not that this has anything to do with the story I think, but if she puts other people into these kinds of situations more often (As in going out with her daughter without a third person available to change the diapers, so she drops the burden on whoever she's visiting.)

She knows that she has those fears so I really can't see why she would leave the house with her kid when they're bound to fill up that diaper and have no way to help her kid out.",881,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/tmnryk/aita_for_refusing_to_change_one_of_my_students/

It's not that I don't get along with them, it's just I have only ever seen them 3 times before this thanksgiving. I have not had any time to really bond with them I guess. They had never met my son in person either, but they both knew about him.

By the time I arrived Jay's parents were already there and helping him finish up dinner. We greeted each other and Jay's dad asked ""And who's this little guy."" I introduced them to my son and then introduced Jay's parents as ""Grandma and Grandpa"" to my precious boy. I didn't notice at the time, but all three of them became quiet almost immediately. I ended up waiting in the living room alone for almost half an hour before dinner and things just were incredibly awkward for the rest of the night. My son did end up calling his parents by grandpa and grandma and I quickly noticed both of them would be very disingenuous and awkward about it over dinner but they did not say anything to me about it. They didn't stick around for long after either but when they left both were very cold to me.

I asked Jay what was their deal and he lost it at me. He claims I put him in an incredibly awkward position. His parents apparently didn't think we were ""That serious"" yet and began to question him if I was only using him as a ""replacement daddy."" He said that it was way out of line to introduce them that way without even talking to him beforehand. I think it's ridiculous. If one day he's going to be my son's stepdad then why go through this formal nonsense? He claimed that's ""Not the point"" and we ended up fighting till I stormed out.

We have not talked since and I have simply been waiting for an apology. I talked with my sister about it last night and she said she was mortified to hear this. Saying she also didn't geat the read that we were all that serious and she never felt like Jay intended to take on a ""Dad"" role. This has got me questioning if I was wrong.

edit:

Ok,  I messed up.

I genuinely thought Jay would be ok with this. Jay has always treated my son so well, I guess I misread treating him kindly as being ok with being his father figure. I'm pretty sure I ruined this for myself, but most importantly I hurt my son through all this.

Edit 2:  
I called Jay and apologized. We're going to be taking a break. I'm going to look into making sure I didn't scar my kid with this.",14552,z64yd5,"Jay is not your husband. He’s not even your fiancé.

AITA for saying no to my In Laws taking our kids to Disney?,"My (M28) wife (F28) and I have two daughters, 6 & 5 years old, which is prime Disney age. They’re both super into princesses and all that. We’ve talked about taking them to Disney over the next few years as we know they’d love it. My wife has never been before, and I’ve only been once- when I was 10 years old. It was definitely a memorable trip for me as my family had to save up a while for it. We’ve always known that Disney would be our big trip with our girls.

In July, my FIL got diagnosed with prostate cancer. After a few rounds of chemo and some rather intense stays at the hospital, it’s only gotten worse. It’s spread across to other organs in his body, and rather than trying to suffer to fight it, he’s opted to just not do chemo and try to live with what time he has left. As a result, him and my MIL have decided to make more memories with family. One of these memories is to take our daughters to Disney & surprised them with the trip yesterday during Christmas.

At first, I thought my wife would be against it as well- we’ve always said we’ve wanted to get to experience taking them and seeing their faces. However, I found out that my MIL cleared it with my wife last month. My wife didn’t tell me because she thought I would be surprised and excited for our daughters. I sat through all of the rest of the night, but when we got home we had a serious discussion about it.

I told my wife that I didn’t want our daughters first trip to Disney to be without us. She suggested we go along, but the trip is in February, and booking flights+hotel+tickets for just my wife and I for the time they’re all going is still going to be almost $5000. I told my wife that we have to talk to her parents & decline the trip, but my wife is saying that I’m being selfish and heartless by robbing our daughters of this experience & robbing them of a core memory with my FIL before he passes. Am I being out of line here?",14547,zvv77q,"YTA. Your wife is right. I understand your disappointment in not being the first to take your kids to Disney, but these are special circumstance. Their grandfather/your wife's father is dying and wants to create memories with his grandchildren that will last once he is gone. It's small minded and selfish to take that opportunity away from him and your children just so you can be the first to have the experience with them. Do you think if you do this your wife and daughter's won't resent you for what you are taking away from them to satisfy your own selfish need. If you do this remember someday your daughter's will be adults and think about how they will look back on this and what they will think about you.",36465,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/zvv77q/aita_for_saying_no_to_my_in_laws_taking_our_kids/
AITA for sending my dying mother to hospic because of what she said?,"I (30M) lost my wife 5 years ago. She had a 10M son who I got custody of after she passed (bio father signed off parental rights at birth and never even met the kid) and we had a 6F daughter together. My 10yro son (I consider him my son in any way) has Down's syndrome. 

My dying mother asked to come live with me two weeks ago to spend more time with us, because she is dying and has only months left to live. I told her she can come spend a week here first (she is here now) and we'll see how it works for everyone, most of all the kids. 

She came, things were going okay. Then a few days ago she special ordered a new set of toys for my 6yro (a REALLY expensive one) which I let fly, even though I don't normally just let my kids choose hundreds of dollars worth of toys, but I get that she was trying to do something nice for her grandkids. 

Then today the set arrived just before dinner and at dinner I asked my son what toys he chose. He said he didn't choose any toys. I asked my mom what he chose (my son sometimes mixes things up and I thought hee just forgot) and she said that she only bought the toys for ""her grandbaby"". I said that she has two grandkids, because I have two children. Then she said ""he's not your son"". I told the kids to go play in the living room, and told my mother that this kind of talking is unacceptable in my house.

 She then said ""it's true, you have no obligation here, you should go foster care or stick it in a facility before your life is ruined"". I flipped out, called her all sorts of names, and told her I'll be calling hospice first thing in the morning and have them take her the same day (which I did). 

She cried all night, begged me to not make her go die alone in a hospic, but I said she crossed a line and I'm done. 

My aunts called me an AH, some of my friends said I should just let it go because her time is limited, and my sister ( who lives abroad) said it was just plain cruel. My cousin said what she said was awful and I did the right thing. I feel a little bit guilty over it anyway.

AITA for doing a mother-son dance with my stepmom at my wedding?,"Im (29M) currently planning a wedding and were getting into the nitty gritty details. For background my parents got divorced when I was 5. The divorce happened after my dad fell in love with his current wife/my stepmom Alice. They claim they didn't cheat but waited to be separated before anything physical happened. I dont know or need to know whether thats true at this point. My dad and Alice got married and were living together by the time I was 7. They had my two siblings within the next 4 years. My parents had split custody and Alice was 100% a mother figure to me. We are very close, she's been there for me for every tough moment of my life. She also helped pay for my college and grad school which Im extremely appreciative of. My mom is a good mom but we've never been as close as I am with my dad and Alice. Our personalities are just very different.

We're planning the first dances right now and have my first dance with my fiancee and she has hers picked out with her dad. Her parents are still married so there's no drama there. Being so close to Alice, I really dont feel right excluding her and only doing a dance with my mom, so I asked her if she'd be comfortable doing one with me as well. She was overjoyed and cried with emotion. Im really excited for it. But once my mom found out she flipped out. Said Im replacing her like my dad replaced her. I told her its not a replacement but she's been so supportive of me my entire life and I consider her a true ""bonus mother"" so I dont want to exclude her. She doesnt want to accept that. Yesterday my aunt (mom's sister) called me and ripped me a new one. I know its a little controversial but in my heart its what I really want to do. AITA for going through with this and having two mother son dances? Personally, I've been to a few weddings with steps involved where there were two mother son or father daughter and it seemed really sweet, not like overkill. I would do shortened versions of the songs so it wont be too long if that matters.",14509,ytdhml,"NAH My sons father left me when we were pregnant with our first child. He left me for his “emotional” affair partner when I was 8 months pregnant, they have been together since and are now married. She has been unkind to me, talks poorly about me in front of my son and has made it clear she is the “better mother”. Maybe like your mother, I know I’ll never have the financial stability to provide for my son like they can as I spent 4 years trying to recoup on a single income while my husband bounced immediately into a new home where they would made 6 figures each. No matter what happens I understand that this woman has been a part of my sons life since birth. He loves her. If he choose to have a mothers dance with her I would silently be a bit sad about it simply because I know she has certainly tried to replace me. But again my son loves her and I would try so hard to not show it because my feelings truly don’t matter. 

Please be aware that the damage of an affair never is truly gone. You grow to accept it but how the other parties handle that affair definitely influence how you move on and the relationship as coparents. I have no idea how your step treated your mother but it can impact things for a long time. You have the right to dance with who you like. Your mother has the right to feel saddened by it and it will likely influence your relationship with her moving forward. 

Your attitude towards your mother is a bit cold. I suggest you work on your empathy.",1488,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/ytdhml/aita_for_doing_a_motherson_dance_with_my_stepmom/
AITA for filing a report again my coworker after I found him looking through my purse?,"
There's this coworker ""Martin"" 31M. who always forgets where he leaves his stuff. He always forgets his phone charger at home and borrows mine to use. I don't mind lending him my charger, He's a nice person and I love maintaining a good relationship with my coworkers. Especially!! male coworkers.


The other day, I was in the restroom then when I walked back into the office, I saw Martin with both hands inside my purse literally looking through it. I was shocked. I have highly personal stuff that I carry in my purse. I freaked out and snatched my purse out of his hands asking what he was doing. He got nervous and said he was looking for my charger. I asked why he thought it was okay for him to look through my purse and he said that, since I always lend him my charger then he thought I wouldn't mind if he looked for it in my purse when he couldn't ask me because I was out of the office and he needed it right then. I told him he violated my privacy and disrespected my boundaries. I went and filed a report with the company's headquaters after telling them what happened. They said it was unacceptable and promised to deal with it.


Martin got int trouble for this and he and my coworkers were pissed saying I overreacted and went way overboard by reporting this situation. My female coworker told me to ""get over myself"" and stop crying victim over a simple ""misunderstanding"".

AITA for not waking my partner up and causing him to miss a family trip?,"My (26F) and my partner (28M) have 5 daughters: 7, 6, 4, 3 and 5 months. For a long time there's been an issue with him getting up to help with the kids of a morning: he thinks he should be able to sleep in on his days off work, while I think he should get up when the kids and I do, or we should at least be alternating who lies in a bit. We've been seeing a therapist who has mentioned he should be helping more in the mornings.

Recently we had a family trip planned to the zoo with both of our parents, our sisters and their kids. Previously when we've gone out for the day I've needed to shake my partner awake several times, and he lies in bed while I get the kids ready. He'll finally get up 5 minutes before we leave as I shout at him I'm getting in the car. I've mentioned to him that this is very frustrating as it's a lot of work getting the kids ready to go out, and it's not fair to leave it up to me while he lies on bed. He'd apologise and promise that the next time he'd get up and help.

The night before the trip I told him I'd need him to be awake at 6.30am, so we could get everyone ready to leave by 8am. He said he'd set an alarm and we went to bed. My alarm went off at 6.30am and I got up, while my partner kept sleeping. I decided I wasn't going to wake him this time and continued getting the kids ready. At 8am he was still sleeping, so I loaded the kids in the car and we set off. We arrived at the zoo at 9.30am, and his family asked where he was. I mentioned he was still in bed and chose not to come.

At 10.15am I got a phone call from him asking where everyone was. I said we went to the zoo as planned, and I waited for him to get up but he never did. He got really mad and told me that I should've woken him up like I always do, and I caused him to miss the trip. He then called his mum and complained to her, who yelled at me in the middle of the zoo that I was being unfair and I should've given him a shake to let him know he needed to get up, and that I was about to leave. My mother jumped in and said it wasn't my responsibility to get him out of bed, and he needed to take responsibility for himself. A few more words were exchanged and his family stalked off for the rest of the trip. I had a blast with my kids, parents, sister, and my nephews. When we got home my partner started on me again about how I should've woken him up.

So AITA so not waking him up and going without him?

A few things have come up I want to clarify:

- He wasn't always like this. When the oldest two were little he was always up with them. He even get up before anyway else to cook breakfast before going off to work. We had to move in with his parents at one point and that's where things started to change. His family are incredibly misogynistic (dad works then comes home, watches TV and drink beer while his mum does everything else, including getting him up for work etc.) These beliefs seems to have rubbed off on him, and his mum is very quick to tell him something is the 'woman's job'.

- He's seeing a therapist independently who has suggested some form of depression. 

- He's generally pretty good otherwise. He will help with dinner, cleaning, putting the kids to bed etc. He's not entirely useless. Getting out of bed in the morning is a long standing issue though.

- He has a vasectomy after baby #4, which turned out to be incomplete. I had a hysterectomy.",14499,uuhzi2,NTA The only way to stop enabling someone is to…stop.

AITA for not letting my neighbors borrow my car for a long trip?,"I (F29) moved to a new neighborhood almost 2 years ago. I live alone, no partner or kids but my mom (f80) does live with me part of the year (6-8months of the year) 

I really like this neighborhood and haven’t any issues until now, it’s a very tight knit “community”, neighborhood bbqs at least once a month, the kids all play together after school etc. 


My next door neighbors to one side have a severely disabled child, she is 6, almost 7, and completely non verbal and wheelchair bound. They have nurses who help care for her but I know her parents are struggling, understandably so, her mom had to quit her job and is a full time carer for her and their other older child. I’ve gotten relatively close to them, the parents, and they are lovely neighbors. Their older child is respectful and honestly one of the sweetest children in the neighborhood. 


For my mom, I bought a minivan and had it customized to have a ramp and wheelchair tie downs so that I can easily transport her and her mobility equipment, usually an ecv or wheelchair, when she’s staying with me. The other 4-6 months of the year, when my mom spends time with her sister and friends in our home country, the car sits mostly unused unless I have a reason to move bigger things that won’t fit in my daily driver. 

I noticed that the neighbors didn’t have a car suitable for transporting their daughter without taking her out of the wheelchair and fighting to keep all her tubes and wires in place so I offered them the use of my minivan if I wasn’t using it to transport my mom. 
We’ve had an agreement in place that has worked well for us for almost 18 months but now they’ve asked if they can use the car to go on a road trip, the trip is scheduled to last just over 2 weeks, the main reason for the trip is to take the kids to Disneyworld for the first time. 
My problem is that my mom is supposed to arrive a couple days after they would leave, I asked if they could delay the trip by just a few days so I can at least get her from the airport with minimal stress. They are adamant they leave on the dates they want to do I said no, I need to be able to comfortably get my mom from the airport and after a 12 hour flight I want her to be comfortable and not have to worry about getting in and out of the car. 

They called me selfish and I’ve been ousted by the rest of the community, I wasn’t invited to the last bbq, nobody says hi or waves back at me on the street anymore. The neighbor kids that come by to see my dogs and run around the yard with them haven’t been by in almost 2 weeks. I tried to text the neighbors but my texts went undelivered so I think they blocked me. 

I feel like I’m living in a hostile environment now and it’s so uncomfortable. Should I just cave and let them take my car?",14509,umpyid,"nta: saw how fast they turned on you when they didint get their way?

She also agreed that her brother was unlikely to be happy about it but she felt like I should tell him immediately anyway.

We kept arguing over it because I told her I needed time to process it and she felt like I was making excuses to avoid telling him. In the end, she told him herself while we were having dinner with their family. He was so upset he confronted me in front of everybody so now they all know and everybody is upset with me for keeping it from him.

His sister kept trying to reach out and apologise after it happened but I was ignoring her as her only excuse was that he was her brother so she couldn’t keep it from him and that she gave me 3 weeks to tell him myself. The last time she called me I was so upset that I answered and yelled at her. In the heat of the moment, I uninvited her from the wedding and told her I would find a new bridesmaid.

AITA for telling my brother off when he berated my daughter for not changing her cousin's diaper?,"
Context: I moved in with my brother after my divorce 3 months ago and brought my 18yo daughter with me. My brother and his girlfriend have a 9 months old daughter (my niece).


This happened this past friday, My brother's girlfriend was on a shift (she's a nurse) and my brother was in a wfh meeting. I was out of the house for hours. He was watching the baby via nannycam and apparently, she needed a diaper change but he was so busy. He texted my daughter asking if she'd go in and quickly change her cousin's diaper but she refused. She told me that she had her reasons. One, she doesn't feel confortable around babies. and two, she was already late for her friend's birthday party (her other friend and brother were waiting on her outside). My brother insisted but she refused which made him cut the meeting and getting kicked out of it. My daughter was out of the house at that point.

I got home and there was a huge argument. I found my brother berating my daughter for not helping with her baby cousin and doing him this small, one time favor now he got kicked out of his meeting. My daughter was crying so I told my brother off and said that his daughter is his and his girlfriend's respondibility and he shouldn't rely on my daughter for her care. He explained how it was just a one time favor and how he's been very supportive of us since I divorced my ex but I told him that it's not an excuse to force my daughter to do what she didn't feel comfortable with. His girlfriend got involved and called me an grateful asshole and told us we have 2 weeks to move out.

I tried to speak to my brother about his girlfriend's decision but he shut me off saying I was in the wrong for telling him off instead of holding my daughter accountable for her lack of support.",14475,ze5s7k,ESH i mean they both sound incredibly stressed and I think there's more to this story than you let on considering this argument led to them giving you 2 weeks notice to get out.

AITA For telling my son I don't like him?,"I love my sons more than anything, I have 3, they were all raised to respect everyone regardless of their differences. My 21 year old and my 19 year old have that down great, my 16 year old however is bullying a gay boy in his class and I was less than happy when I found out (his cousin told me).

I gave him the chance to invite him over for dinner and apologize but he refused, he wouldn't say sorry, at all. I get it, it's embarrassing being told off in front of your friends but I don't care, I wasn't happy with his treatment. I ended up grounding him but it didn't seem to be affecting him at all and he clearly wasn't learning his lesson.

I contacted the family and let them know what was going on and they agreed to meet up for dinner and again I gave my son a chance to apologize, he got extremely upset/angry, maybe both and said that nobody even liked the 'f word'. Of course I apologized and the family left.

My son and I got into a big argument when they left where he said he wasn't sorry and again that nobody likes this kid, I told him that I don't like him very much right now either. He got quiet, apologized and went to his room.

I've now been told that he's apologized to the student he was bullying and his grounding has been lifted, he's still hiding in his room and we very rarely speak.

My ex husband says I shouldn't have told him I don't like him and that there's no excuse and of course that that behaviour is the reason we're not together, because I can't help but be a miserable AH. I understand it may not have been the nicest thing to hear but he was not listening to a word I was saying and was being a downright bully.

AITA?

A lot has happened since I made my post so I figured I'd just pop in to let people know how it unfolded. I've had a little chit chat with my son to get to the bottom of his behaviour and it turns out he'd asked his victim on a date and was turned down. Instead of acting like a normal human being he decided to be spiteful and started bullying the boy. He's still making up for it and we've had a talk about consent and the fact that nobody is obligated to date him. He knows I understand he was hurt but he should have spoken to me, after all, it's what I'm here for. 

My ex is also openly homophobic and he no longer wants to visit him on weekends, so hopefully his father will no longer make such a great impression.

AITA for missing my grandchild's birth to attend my other daughter's wedding?,"I am the mother to two wonderful daughters; Sophia, 32 and Nichole 26 and I'm really not sure if I was cruel toward Sophia for my decision or not. Nichole got married this year and Sophia had her first child which is my first grandchild.

I've had a good relationship with both my daughters and I've always tried to make sure neither of them felt like I favored the other but I admit there were some rough patches with Sophia. When Nichole got engaged she asked if I would walk her down the aisle since her father has never been in her life. I asked her what about her uncles or brother and she said no, she wanted me. I was more than happy to agree and helped her plan her wedding. My daughter Sophia announced her pregnancy around the beginning of the year. The timing panned out that she would be due after Nichole's wedding so she asked if I would be in the delivery room with her and stay with her and her husband for a few weeks after the baby was born to help out. I was very excited too, and since we already live in the same town and see each other almost daily, staying with her wouldn't have been a problem at all.

Instead, Sophia went into labor almost 3 weeks early; the afternoon before Nichole's wedding. I missed Sophia's first call because I was already almost 2.5 hours away where Nichole lives and helping set things up and doing last minutes errands to help. When I called her back I found out she was in labor and she wanted me to get there as soon as possible. I told Sophia I would do the best I could and would let her know immediately when I'd be there. I explained the situation to Nichole, who understandably also wanted me to be there for her but understood that Sophia wanted me with her too. Nichole was able to move her ceremony to the morning and make it a quick 25ish minute ceremony and there would just be a few hours gap between the ceremony and reception. I thought this was a good compromise that would let me be there for both of my girls. I called Sophia and she wanted me to get there that night. I asked if her husband was with her and she said yes, so I asked her to please consider him as a second choice until I could get there. Sophia got upset and told me to forget about it.

I got to the hospital early the next afternoon and missed the birth by a couple of hours. Sophia was so mad she didn't want me to come in when she was moved to a room. I thought that was understandable and she would talk to me soon but it's been a couple of weeks now and I  have tried to apologize to her. I've talked to my son-in-law and he said they're both mad that I chose to ditch Sophia when she needed me most for a party. So I am here asking an outsider's perspective if I was wrong to not go to the hospital right away. AITA?

Edit: I did not stay for Nichole's reception. I left immediately following the ceremony, she still had to wait a few hours from the end of her wedding ceremony in the morning until her reception that afternoon.

AITA for spending my daughter’s tuition money?,"Our daughter is 20F and she recently decided to go back to college after taking a year off. She dropped out of college a few months saying it wasn’t for her. We adamantly advised against it but she ended up moving in with her boyfriend and started working in his family’s restaurant business. There was still a little north of 30k set aside in the account I set aside for her tuition money. My wife and I had been wanting to remodel our kitchen for a while so decided to go ahead with that money. Well now my daughter has decided to go back to college because it didn’t work out with her boyfriend and she didn’t like any of the jobs she had following that. 

She was shocked that we had used her college money towards the house even though we had this conversation before she left. She asked if she could have access to her college tuition account before she moved in with her boyfriend to which we explicitly said no and said that was saved for her tuition only and nothing else and that if she left we’d use it for something else. She said she thought we were bluffing and didn’t actually mean it and that we need to help her pay for college since we are still paying for her younger brother’s yearly tuition. I told her she needs to work part time and go to a cheaper place like community college rather than a state school. 

She’s been angry over this and ignoring her mother’s phone calls. Her mother has said maybe we can still help her out financially but we’re nearing our retirement age and a little behind our retirement goals so I don’t want to take away from our savings just because my daughter made some bad choices. I feel like I have given her good alternatives and even offered to let her stay at our house free of rent so she can just focus on paying for college. AITA?",14419,y6rjz1,"YTA 

As far as I see it, you just spent 30k of your retirement savings on a kitchen. 

She's 20, that's still mentally a child in most peoples eyes. You can make a lot of stupid decisions at all points in life, but no time is it more damaging than when you've just received the freedom of being ""an adult."" The fact that you didn't let it sit for a couple years for her shows that you're selfish and you don't truly care about her well-being, plus this is reckless spending (behind on savings but blew 30k on an unnecessary kitchen remodeling? How tf is a kitchen 30k?? Thats ridiculous.) 

She's still learning from you, and what you just taught her is that even her family will throw her away if it suits them. The whole world is ready to hurt and tear into her, absolutely frothing at the mouth with bad intentions. You are supposed to be a safe place that she can fall back to when the real world bears its ugly teeth. You dont need to teach her real-life lessons, shes going to get that with time, so whats the rush in ruining her faith? On top of destroying what little hope your child has left, you are willingly going to put her in debt and that interest rate is going to kill her. If you truly want her to succeed, then you wouldnt force your child to work while going to school just because you wanted fancier appliances and white subway tile backsplash to match your slick new kitchen island. 

Are you telling us that your daughters continued education and entire future was only worth a shiny new kitchen? I cant comprehend how you think this is an equal trade off.

As she struggles to find joy in studying, working the night shift 4 days a week and missing out on ""the college experience"", the resentment is going to grow. She's going to come home to her brother who's lazing around on the couch playing games on a console which you bought him and wonder why her life is so much harder (I bet theres been growing tensions of him always getting what he wants since childhood, parents statistically ease up on their second child and even more so if its a boy).

It's already going to be hard enough growing up in a world where the patriarchy is actively working against her because she was born the wrong gender, do you have to blatantly make it worse? She's going to think you don't love her, that you're playing favorites, and it's going to lead up to a big fight where you take no accountability and blame her (an inexperienced, immature girl who just started understanding how the world truly works) for her bad decisions. She's going to then leave and continue to make more bad decisions for years to come, all the while ignoring any attempts at communication. You've proven to her that she can't rely on you and she's going to manifest that truth for the rest of her life.

My father pulled the same BS on me and it has forever ruined our relationship to the point where he is not invited to my wedding, the birth of my child, etc. You're either there for your daughter, or you're not. You don't get to pick and choose what's easiest for you. She will FOREVER be your responsibility as you made the conscious decision to bring her into this world. How you treat her now, during her final formative years, is how she will be for the rest of her life.",21,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/y6rjz1/aita_for_spending_my_daughters_tuition_money/
AITA for telling my dad that I'll GLADLY spend christmas with him if he gives me back my college fund as a christmas gift?,"
To make this brief. I M23 had issues with my dad after my mom died and my stepmom came along. I hated a lot of decisions that were made, but what has left a long lasting impact was taking my college fund to pay for my stepbrother's surgeries. Unfortunately, he's dead (died last year at the age of 16 from a chronic heart problem). I put my distance but still see my grandparents and uncles, aunts, cousins etc.


With the holiday season coming up, dad started talking to me through some relatives - close relatives. He went on about his overwhelming feelings of lonliness, his upcoming divorce and invited me to spend christmas with him because he's alone and heartbroken. As a response, I told him I'll GLADLY spend christmas with him if he gives back my college fund in a form of a christmas gift. He and the others didn't like my response. He thought this was harsh and my relatives said that I was a judgemental, petty, greedy asshole to say this to him after he's lost so much. They said he did all he could to save his stepson (my stepbrother) life which they described as ""noble"" and that he doesn't owe me a thing. I went home after a big argument with my uncle who came at me for what I said.


Now I feel like shit. Maybe I should've just calmly, politely declined the invite and not said this to him and made him feel guilty for how he handled my stepbrother's situation.


EDIT I just took a look and I see that I'm getting a shitload of comments here. To answer few questions:

1_the fund was made by my dad, mom was a sahm and didn't work but they both agreed that this fund would go towards my educatiotion. 2_I was able to get in college, I started working to pay my way and had some relatives help but my uncle did so much for me which is why I said felt like shit when he berated me. He holds a special place in my life and he's the last person I want to disppoint or let down.


EDIT2 Okay for those who are saying the fund wasn't mine. Whose fund was it then? LMFAO I really don't get this maybe you can expand on how exactly the fund wasn't mine and to whom it belonged? Also, for those that think that I'm being cruel to my dad after he lost so much. I try not to go out of my way to be mean or malicious. Matter of fact, I want little to nothing to do with him but all this time I been playing nice to please my uncle and relatives but that's it.",14412,yzj7p0,Another family broken up cause health care sucks somewhere… you can probably guess where…,115,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/yzj7p0/aita_for_telling_my_dad_that_ill_gladly_spend/
AITA because I am forcing my parents to choose between two options they loathe.,"I (F38) have recently gotten a not great medical diagnosis and prognosis.  I am at peace with it. 

So I have sat down with my husband and figured out my will.  Obviously he will be receiving most of the estate.  He has to take care of himself and our kids.  He and I both have decent if not spectacular careers and he likes his work.  

My oldest brother is a gigantic D-bag. He is an addict and my parents have wasted their lives trying to help him. They spent somuch of their time and money on him they had very little formy sister or myself.  I don't hold this against them. I love my kids and I can understand the urge to help them with their problems.  

The real issue is that my brother has abandoned my nieces with my parents.  I tried to get custody of them but I am not a member of their church and my parents cut me off when I left home to get a college education instead of staying home and helping them like a good daughter should.  Their congregation helped them hire a lawyer to keep the girls away from me.  But strangely enough after the girls were out of my reach they stopped getting any financial support.  

So on my will I am leaving my nieces money.  Not for them to spend however they want.  It is only to go to pay for their post secondary education.  If it isn't used for that by the time they are 25 it will be donated to a charity that my parents hate.  It advocates for women and reproductive rights.  

I sent my parents a copy of my will so they knew what was coming.  They are the kind of people who would take out a loan counting on money from my death to bail them out.  

They are calling me an asshole for not giving them the money to take care of my nieces. They are complaining because they are going into debt taking care of the girls.  I offered again to take custody with my husband.  If I can have them for two years I know I can get them on a path away from that church.  

My parents won't relent and are saying that they will challenge my will if I leave it like this.  Good luck. My lawyer is confident that I have protected the money.  

I just heard from my brother.  He is calling me an asshole for depriving his kids of help and forcing my parents into a shitty position.  I asked him when the last time he sent them money to help with his kids was.  He yelled obscenities and hung up.  

My husband supports my decision.  But a lot of my family is calling me and asking me to help my parents with no strings attached.  

AITA?

AITA for yelling at my coworkers after they made an inappropriate joke about my promotion?,"Sorry if I seem too out of place, i don't really use this platform but my brother told me to post here.

I (female 26) work in a tech company, i started working there right after i graduated college. I started with the lowest rank (ofc) but I've been promoted twice (kind of like a more important job but still had some people above me first and recently to manager of my section)

When i started working in this company i met my boss and we become good friends, we had a short relationship too during some time but ended up (on good terms). My coworkers don't know this, or at least they can't be 100% sure if we dated because we never told anyone, although they could see us leave together sometimes and join the dots I guess.

While we were dating i got my first promotion and people made some comments (because i was fairly new, although i did worked a lot for that promotion) but i ignored them.

Recently as I said, i got another promotion and my coworkers wanted to go out to celebrate. I agreed and we went to a bar, not many of us, just the department i work at (and not even all of them, we were like 12) 

We had some fun, but then one of my coworkers told me i should be proud of how much i worked to get this promotion and another of my coworkers (a woman) told me i must be tired from work, especially the ""inside the sheets"" work. They all started laughing and make jokes about it, like if making our boss fall in love with me was my plan all along, calling me a strategic woman, and telling me i must suck d*ck so we'll because our boss got me two promotions.

I obviously was angry and embarrassed, so i reminded them that even if i was dating him he couldn't give me a promotion because we have other bosses too and out boss can't make that kind of decisions by himself but they just brushed me off by telling me that his opinion matters and that he can easily convince the other bosses to promote me if he wants to. 

I told them it was really disgusting that they were implying that i am a wh*re and that i need to sleep with our boss for a promotion, payed my bill and left. 

The next morning i went to hand them a project that our boss asked us to finish. The same woman who started the jokes told me it was rude that i left when all of them were celebrating me, she said they were joking and that i should apologize with them. 

I tried to ignore them and just hand them the project so we could get started and told them to just start working, same woman said ""okay Mrs (boss's last name). I lost it then, i yelled at them to shut up and get to work already or I'll fill a report with HR. They all left to work after that.

I've talked to my boss about this and he agrees with me but then i told my brother what happened and he thinks i shouldn't have yelled at them, although he agrees that they were rude with me too.  my mother also thinks that. Now I'm kinda confused as if i was an asshole or not and my brother recommend me to post here


EDIT: 

I've talked to my boss about this again, he told me our company doesn't have any dating policy, i also checked it myself. I decided to not go to HR just yet, I'll try to make things peaceful between me and my coworkers again, but my boss did recommend me to write a report just to have a written proof that this happened.

EDIT 2:

I had a long day at work today (i had my manager training) but i made time to talk to my coworkers. 

I've decided that since they have doubts about my promotion i asked HR to do an investigation about it, they'll see if I'm the best person for the charge, they said that it's gonna take a couple days and they asked me to keep my manager duties for the meantime. As there might be a chance i lose my promotion and will have to go back to my position as a senior, i asked HR if there was any chance i can have my senior salary this month too (i got a raise with the new promotion) and also refused to use other privileges i had now. (My coworkers asked me that, i had no problem with it)

I also apologized for yelling at them and some of them apologized for making those jokes/ laughing at them. 
I told them about my relationship with my boss and they just reminded me that our company has no rule against dating, basically they told me they didn't care about that. I agreed with my coworkers to tell everything about this matter to HR (that includes the argument at the bar, my relationship with my boss and the timing of my promotions) so HR could see the full picture, that meant filling a report against them, they'll be sanctioned. 

I also told them i did all of this because i wanted to make our work environment at least peaceful but i also said that they could talk to HR to be moved to another department if they wanted to, only one person left (that woman who started everything)

My boss also asked HR to investigate if he had ever taken advantage of his charge to help me/ other people get an promotion or any benefit, so we'll all be sure that nothing wrong is happening.

Basically a lot of work for HR, i know many of you gave me different advices (like not to go to HR) but i think this is the best i can do. If HR thinks i shouldn't be a manager then I'll gladly go back to my position before and I'll try to work hard to get another promotion maybe. If HR thinks i was the best candidate for the promotion then my coworkers will know that I'm not there just because i had a relationship with my boss before. 

I'll probably won't edit this anymore now, thank you for the advice.",14379,w0hgv9,"If you’re gonna get HR involved, make sure you tell them the part where your boss was dating his subordinate and gave her a promotion in the process.",1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/w0hgv9/aita_for_yelling_at_my_coworkers_after_they_made/
AITA for buying my gf a blender instead of the necklace she wanted for our anniversary?,"Before I start I’d like to say that my gf and I are both women. We are lesbians. I say this to hopefully preempt the ‘typical man’ comments. 

This happened last month but my best friend and hers are still giving me shit about it. We had our one year anniversary. I asked what she wanted and she told me just something romantic, a little necklace or something cute. While browsing around on Amazon I found an emulsion blender and it pinged in my head. My gf loves cooking and always talks about all the gadgets she wants. Plus she made homemade tomato sauce and I remember her complaining how hard it was to make the sauce smooth cause she didn’t have an emulsion blender. I’m a very practical gift giver, I like to give things people will use so I bought it and was super excited to give it to her. 

The day rolls around and she gives me a bottle of whiskey I’ve had my eye on for ages but could never justify the cost. I was so hyped and encouraged my gf to open hers. She opened it and her face kinda falls and she goes ‘oh… an emulsion blender…?’ And I told her I remembered her talking about all the kitchen gadgets she wanted and was so excited to give it to her. She kept her cool but told me while she appreciated the thought she was a little upset that it wasn’t jewelry. I was confused so she explained that she felt anniversary’s should be more about romantic/sentimental gifts versus practical, that she appreciated it greatly but couldn’t lie to me that she wished it had been the necklace she pointed out to me online (it was nothing fancy, a $30 mushroom necklace). I shared my woes with my friend and my friend thought it was hilarious that I was so inept, and that he understood why my gf was upset with her gift. Gf’s best friend also got wind of the situation and has been ribbing me with telling my gf to get back to the kitchen jokes etc. My gf and I are fine but I know she was disappointed, and she ended up buying the necklace herself a week after I gave her the blender.

AITA for not letting my daughter have locks for her room,"My (43f) daughter Lara (17f) has been struggling to focus on her studies with her brothers Kyle (12m) and Ryan (9m) constantly disrespecting her privacy. A few days ago, she was yelling for Kyle to come to her room. I asked her what happened. She explained that Kyle flipped all her items upside down. I called Kyle to come and flip everything right side up.

Yesterday, Ryan was running into her room and kept stealing her stuff, while she ran to get them back. On the night of the same day, Lara was trying to sleep, when the brothers suddenly barged in and ran through it, resulting in her screaming at them to stay out and close the door while she was sleeping, to give a few examples.

Today in the morning, her father (48m) told her he didn't like the way she was screaming. She said that she was trying to sleep and her brothers were making all kinds of ruckus. He told her that they are kids and they will learn. She said that they will never learn and the only way for them to learn is to have locks installed for her room. He did not want her to and they went back and forth on this until she threatened she would move out as soon as she became financially independent since she wasn't going to wait for them to mature and they should already know to respect her privacy to which he said to wait to include me in the conversation.

I overheard, and when she went to her room, I told her she wasn't going to have locks set up because she already wastes her time without the need for locks and I don't want her to fail. Lara said that they were never going to listen without them and I told her that I would make sure they wouldn't enter her room.

This evening, I heard her shouting for me. We were all in the living room. Her father explained what was going on. Lara said that she was making Kyle tea when he did he's not allowed to do. She said that she was going to tell on them and he said that if she promises to not tell, he and Ryan will never go into her room again. She didn't say anthing so they ran upstairs to her room.

I told her that she has no right to complain since she always sleeps in Kyle's room after school. Her brothers all agree and Lara calls all of us the worst, none of us are allowed in her room, and leaves. She comes back after a minute and says that she only sleeps in Kyle's room because he never uses it aside from sleeping at night, and if he was to use it for studying, then she would never go there. Meanwhile, they constantly disturb her, mess with her stuff, and made her unable to sleep just last night.

I told her if they ever go into her room, she needs to go to me. Then Kyle starts saying that they had the right to go into her room while she was trying to sleep because they were playing. Lara yelled at him, then said that she couldn't wait to move out soon so she no longer has to deal with them.

AITA for canceling a wedding gift when the wedding was canceled?,"My husband's sister was supposed to be married in September. I chose an item from the registry, but the exact item she had added had a weird detail (she had explicitly mentioned previously needing option A, but on the registry she accidentally listed option B) so I asked her to make sure I got what she needed. So, she knew exactly what I was planning to gift.

Sadly they have now broken up. The gift hadn't shipped yet anyway, so I canceled it.

This past week she reached out to me about it. Since she knew I was purchasing it and we live far away, she was concerned that it had been delivered but someone had stolen it. When I explained that I had canceled it, she was pretty upset.

My MIL has now reached out to us about it and feels that I was unkind to cancel the order. She feels that since my SIL is clearly going through a difficult time, and the holidays are approaching, it would've been more appropriate to let the gift reach her anyway.

Obviously these are unfortunate circumstances, but this was a substantial gift ($700) and pretty well above the threshold of what I'd normally spend for a typical holiday gift.

AITA For telling my wife she has no choice in the discipline of my children?,"My ex wife and I parted shortly after the birth of my 9 year old daughter, we also have a 12 year old son together. It wasn't a messy breakup in the slightest, she just fell out of love, and we still maintain an incredible friendship today. Co-parenting with her is easy, we have 50/50 custody (no courts involved) they spend a week with me and then a week with her, we live close by anyway anyway and they love the arrangement. My ex wife and I both agreed on the way we would raise and punish our children should they misbehave that way the structure stays consistent and we don't have one parent favoured over the other.

I've been dating a girl for around 7 years now and she's always been amazing to my children, last December we got married and things were fine up until now.

Last week my daughter stole 2 pockets full of chocolate from a little corner store, where as my ex and I would have marched her into the store, return the chocolate to the owner and apologize, my new wife took my children home, sat my daughter at the table and forced her to eat the entire lot by herself, making her brother watch. She continued to make my daughter eat even after she'd complained of a belly ache. My son told me when I got home from work.

I immediately confronted my wife, telling her that my ex and I both had a system in which to discipline our kids and that she has absolutely no choice in that, that if she's to punish the children she goes by our agreed upon methods. It keeps everything consistent and I didn't appreciate her making my daughter feel sick (she slept all night and skipped dinner because of her stomach). My wife is extremely upset and says I can't expect her to be married to me and not have a say in how they are raised, I again repeated that how they are raised is up to me and my ex and she should respect and follow those methods.

I got the silent treatment for a few days before she said she just couldn't handle the sight of me anymore and went to stay with her mother. Of course her mother is now calling me an AH and saying that I'm treating her as an unequal parental figure in the house and that she should have a say in how the kids are raised as well considering she's the stepmom. I spoke to my ex about it and she agrees with my stance and thanked me for standing up for our choices and defending our agreement.

AITA?

Little update for ya'll. 

Things blew up quite dramatically in the last 20 hours and I've had the chance to have a talk with my kids about their treatment while I'm not at home. As a lot of people suspected and warned me, and what I feared, she's been using her own parents punishment tactics on my son whenever he misbehaves. This has included making him stand out in the sun on the concrete until she lets him go (as punishment for jumping in the pool when he was told not to), ripping up his sketch books (punishment for drawing on his desk) and putting his hands in icy water (punishment for stealing an ice pop). My son only rang the alarm this time because it was his sister who was punished. 

Again, I confronted my wife and she doesn't seem to find a problem with her actions and claims it was all related to the behaviour he exhibited. 

Needless to say I'm not happy and she's gotta go. ",14313,tjsnc6,"NTA.

AITA for not paying half towards my dog's puppies' vet bills and expenses?,"I know this sounds insane but its been causing grief for weeks.

I moved back home a few years ago to take over my parents' hobby farm. My parents asked I continue to keep sheep and goat herds. Predator animals are common so we've always had livestock guard dogs there. I have 2, they are very well trained and socialized, but I don't allow dogs I don't know on the farm unless I'm there the entire time.

The set up is like an 'H' - One side is the sheep pastures/barn, the other side is goats. In the middle is a gigantic fenced in area for the dogs where their toys, feeders, water troughs, wading pools and dog sheds are. They can go from one pasture to the other. The gate to the dog area faces the back of the house. It was a regular garden gate but I fixed it so predators couldn't climb over the top of it. The only space is about a 8inch gap between the top of the gate and the gate post to move the latch easily. Too small for my dogs to squeeze through and nothing has gone through there before.

One of my dogs is a male and not neutered for reasons relating to the community and us all knowing where our helpers come from and are going to since these doggos perform a specific function in a farming community. Other dog is an older female and spayed.

My job requires me to travel once in awhile. I had a week trip about 4 months ago. My gf invited her friend Taylor to come stay with her while I was gone. Before Taylor arrived she asked us if there was a room she could put her dog's crate in. I told her not to bring her dog since I'd be gone. She arrives, she has her dog. In heat. My gf told her she could bring her. I offered to pay for her dog to go to the local kennel since I'd be gone, my gf and Taylor said I was controlling. I told them I just didn't want to leave room for issues. Day before I have to leave, Taylor let her dog out unsupervised and I caught her dog trying to squeeze through the gap of the gate. Got her dog, brought it back in, told her she either keeps her dog on a leash and supervised at all times when outside, or she goes home now. My gf and I fought about it again, and I had to leave for my work trip before it was resolved.

I asked my cousin while I was gone, he said he and his wife saw the dog on the leash. Taylor left the day I got home. Weeks later her dog had puppies. Gf admitted they only put Taylor's dog on the leash when my cousin was over, and let her run the rest of the time. Her dog kept getting into the dog yard with my boy and they stopped her if they saw her. Taylor wants me to pay half of the vet bills and puppy expenses until they're homed. She's railing about me to my gf about not having my dog neutered. I refuse to pay. My dogs are contained and they stayed where they are supposed to be, and I told Taylor to not bring her dog to begin with. She and my gf can cover the expenses since they went behind my back. Am I in the wrong here?

EDIT: I will post updates to my profile since this issue is not yet fully resolved. Thank you everyone for your support and kindness.

AITA for refusing to bend the rules on seeing my newborn just for one person(sil) even it the only chance she’s has to see him for months,"So I (34f) gave birth on Christmas Day before my sons birth and to lessen visits. We (my husband 28m) made a list in October and sent it out to everyone 

Some rules include 
-up to date on ALL vaccines 
-if you feel anyway sick don’t visit 
- let us know a week before hand so we can arrange a day/time
- no smokers 
- no phone calls or visits between 7:30pm-10pm 
-you can only stay an hour 
-no picking up the baby without consent 
-no Adivce 
-no perfume/deodorant 
- no is no we won’t explain why 
- no pictures to be taken or posted on social media 
- if you visit the first time you will be expected to give mom (me) a gift card and a gift for baby from out approved list
- before you ever come no matter how many times you will be give a list of a ether food or groceries to bring with you AND a chore for a list of your choosing 
- no more than two visits a week per person 

It’s help to keep the visits to minimum and no one can complain about favouritism because everyone is treated equally. 
Which brings me onto my current situation my sister in law(20f)  studies in a different part of the country and is rarely home asked to visit last week before she had to go back to school, so We set up a date with link to our gift list than sent her the takeout we’d like including the chores she can choose from 

Sent immediately texted back saying she’s broke and can she do extra chores instead,
Me and my husband talked about it and came to the decision that if we bent the rules for one person everyone would want the same treatment 

We told her no that we were very clear about our rules and maybe next time she could visit. She begged even said would clean the whole house because it would be June before she’s would be home again and we simply texted no. She didn’t reply 

She left this morning and we got multiple texts for my in laws belittling us for using our child as a cash grab, my husband simply replied it was our rules and no one deserves special treatment than told his family they were on a time out and blocked them

Since than my family and our friends have told us we were wrong because she is a broke collage student and they would have understood if we looked the other way once. We have tried reaching out to his sister but she won’t reply",14300,sedejn,"This must be your first child and I feel for this kid already.   You sound tiring to be around.

"AITA for leaving a bad review on a diner and ruining the waitress' life just because she was ""complementing"" my husband's eyes?","

My f33 husband's m30 birthday was several days ago, we decided to go celebrate at a new diner and invited my inlaws to join us.


Throughtout the entire celebration, this 20ish waitress who served our table kept acting strange, she didn't take her eyes off my husband and threw some inappropriate comments at him and infront of us as she came and went.


I was feeling uncomfortable, but decided to not make a scene hoping she'd stop but when she brought the drinks, She puts them on the table, leans close enough towards my husband thinking no one would hear but we heard what she said and it was ""the sparkle of those eyes is igniting me!"" (PS my husband has electric-blue eyes). I was flabergasted, truly! I couldn't believe she just said that!

I told her ""you know what? You're being inappropriate right now, and you need to stop"". She then smug smiled then turned around and walked away. I got weird looks from my inlaws and it was AWEFUL.


I got home and left a very bad review on the diner, the next day I'm contacted by the manager asking me to specify the bad experience I had at their diner and I tell him. He then calls back and tells me their business is new and this kind of reviews might harm their reputation, then asks what it'd take for me to take it down. I tell him some consequences to the waitress. He calls back to tell me he just fired her but before I take down the review, I'm contacted by the waitress on my SM telling me that she didn't mean to cause disturbance and was just ""complimenting"" my husband's eyes, but I ruined her career and caused her to potentially lose her apartment and become homeless after getting fired from the diner and being unable to pay rent. I don't respond but my inlaws point out that I overreacted and this stuff happen too often at diners and I just caused irreparable damage to this young lady's life over ""nothing"". Also MIL said that I must've done this because I felt jealous of the waitress.

AITA?

ETA: My review was left on the business' facebook page. I was contacted by the manager via my phone number that was available on my profile. But the waitress reached out via message.

ETA2: So I'm seeing a variety of opinions here of what I should have done/or how I should have handled this. I agree that I might have let things get out of hand but I had no plans to get her fired, didn't even want to get the manager involved. Just leave a review and that's it.

Also to all those asking ""insecure/jealous much?"" I'll give you the same answer I gave my MIL, I might have been BUT I just don't think that this was an appropriate way to act at work. That is all!",14285,s98s3t,[removed],625,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/s98s3t/aita_for_leaving_a_bad_review_on_a_diner_and/
AITA for telling my Fiance to get over himself?,"I'm engaged to my fiance (Sam/41) and we're getting married soon. I will say that he was married before and had a 13 year old son who passed away 4 years ago. Let me tell you he is still pretty much grieving, not judging him for that but his grieving can and will cloud his thinking sometimes.

We're currently in the wedding planning phase, he asked that we ""reserve"" a chair at the venue for his deceased son. I was dumbfounded when I heard this but he said that he knows his son will be there for him spriritually and he'd like to reserve a seat for him out of respect and to make him feel ""included"", I tried to be gentle because this seemed insane and told him we can't do that because guests will be asking questions and will think he's mentally unstable. I asked him to let go of this idea but he offered a compromise by leaving the last chair (in the very back) empty so no one will notice. I felt uneasy and asked him to just let it go but he kept bringing it up saying he gets a say since it's his wedding and his son was and will always be family, I had a fight with him telling him it's my wedding too and I don't people to laugh at us. he said I have nothing to lose if I say yes and that I'm being selfish. I snapped and told him to get over himself and he got quiet suddenly and stopped arguing then shut down completely. I then heard him sob while he was smoking outside and refused to speak to me, didn't even let me sit with him. he has been like this eversince the fight and has been avoiding me. I could have blown this out of propotion but I thought his request will weird out many guests and make our wedding a laughing stock.


*editing to add that I didn't think that such thing was common. I admit that I should've handled the conversation better but the guests I was referring to are my male cousin, they're terrible and make fun of everything and take every opportunity to turn an event into a laughing stock. I can't keep them from attending because they're family but at the same time don't want to give them a chance to hurt Sam's feelings or make rude comments. I love Sam and sympathize with his struggle but I feel like he's being dismissive of my feelings and thoughts.*",14286,u4wb9h,YTA - Leaving a front row seat open at the ceremony and having an “in memory” table with some pictures of loved ones you wish could attend at the reception are both very common wedding practices for people who have lost close family members.,8839,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/u4wb9h/aita_for_telling_my_fiance_to_get_over_himself/
AITA for not giving up my treadmill for three friends who wanted to use three of them right next to each other,"To put things in to perspective my uni’s gym gym has 8 treadmills. There are two together at one end of the gym and the rest are all in their own line. However in the line of six the second and the five treadmill are out of order 


I was on a treadmill at the gym today when a woman approached me and said “hey I need that treadmill”. I was on third treadmill in the row. When the woman said this I noticed two other women getting on the fourth and fifth treadmills and every other treadmill was free so it wasn’t like I was jogging a machine or anything. 

So I said, “uh why? There are open treadmills…” she replied “yeah but YOU are on the oke next to my friends.” 

I replied, “and?” And she said “I came here to work out with my friends. I’m not going to be on a treadmill that isn’t next to my friends, so I’m asking that you please move to a different treadmill so I can be with my friends” 

I replied, “and I’m Declining to move” 
The woman then said, “but like you said there are other machines open so like you can move to another one, I don’t see why you are making this an issue.” 

So I said , “you are the one  making  this an issue. I’m in the middle of my workout and have no obligation to move. I was here first and I said no. I’m not moving.” 

The woman said to her friends, “this isr worth it, I’m leaving.” The other women stopped their work out and got off the treadmill and started to follow their friend. One of them looked back at me said to the other, “wow what a jerk” 

I don’t think I was being rude or unreadable. Was i?",14284,tqm5rd,NTA- they are lucky there was even 3 available machines anywhere in the gym.

AITA for wanting to wear high heels at my wedding despite my fiance's objection?,"


My fiance (31) is short. His height has always been a source of insecurity for him and he takes others comments too seriously.


With our wedding approaching, He asked if I'd consider wearing flat shoes at the wedding. I was confused, like very confused I asked if he was joking but he went on a rant about how doesn't want to be made fun of on his own wedding. and that if I choose to wear high heels then we will look 'awkward' in the photos and infront of the guests. I refused and he kept calling me selfish and inconsiderate and said that I prioritized a bare of high heels over his comfort and happiness for the big day. 

He had his mom involved and she is pushing me to reconsider. When I refused to discuss it she said that my unwillingness to cooperate is a huge indicator of my level of maturity, she then went on a long rant about what lengths 'real wives' are willing to go to to help out their husbands and said that I'm apparently too immature and shallow to be committed in a marriage if I make such an issue out of it.

Am I being selfish? It's not just about what I want but the high heels help make the wedding dress look better and I feel like I deserve to look my best at my own wedding just like every bride's dream. His insecurity is preventing me from getting that. AITA?





Edit, typos ).

To clarify, I'm slightly taller but he said he doesn't want me to look any taller than that.

(1). The gusts he was talking about are his male friends, and the men in his family. They comment on his height all the time, call him names from ""shorty, koala, Lil D, hobbit"" and the list is long. They even have a list of jokes about him.


(2). Like I said, I'm slightly taller and he doesn't want me to be any taller.

AITA for saying I will never host another family event?,"We had a family get together for Father’s Day. My older brother (Adam 45) came over also . We all got pizzas. My son Drew (14) is Autistic and vegetarian. He also had food texture issues so the only pizza he likes is cheese. 

Drew was waiting until everyone settled down to get his pizza to avoid him being overwhelmed.  Adam who normally eats meat lovers pizza went second to last and grabbed the last 6 pieces of cheese and licked them in front of my son. So now he didn’t have any pizza to eat. 

I called out Adam out and he laughed saying “early birds” I got pissed and kicked Adam out of my home. My parents got mad saying it was Father’s Day and I’m ruining it for my dad. I ended up telling my mom this is the last family event that I will ever host at my home. (We hosted everything since I got married almost 20 years ago) 

My parents said I overreacted thus ruining my dad’s Father’s Day. I said it was Adam who ruined it by going after a Kid with autism for no reason.

AITA for bothering a woman at home?,"My son (4) had a sleepover last night with a friend. This friend's parents were doing my wife and I a huge favor, because my wife's father had surgery yesterday, and we needed to be there and didn't get home until after midnight. So yes, this story begins with us already in debt to them. Anyway, at naptime today my son started freaking out because he couldn't find sleepy Dumbo (his stuffed animal) and he *cannot* sleep without sleepy Dumbo.

I remembered that when I picked him up I didn't see sleepy Dumbo. So I text the mom and dad of the friend. I get no response. My wife is a wreck, so I'm not bothering her with this, but my son is freaking out. So I tell him we will get in the car and go get sleepy Dumbo and he slightly calmed down. So we drive over and I try to call them both on the way.

When we get there, I knock, and we wait a bit with no answer. At this point my son starts freaking out more because he is afraid something happened to sleepy Dumbo. I try to reassure him, but he starts crying. I knock again, and the wife of the couple answers. She says she is working and asks what I want. I explain about sleepy Dumbo.

She again says she is working, and she says she doesn't have time to look for Dumbo and tells us to come back later. My son starts freaking out more. I ask if we can look. She says she needs to focus. I promise to be fast. She lets me in.

We get to his friend's room, sleepy Dumbo is on the bed. My son gets him, and I hustle us out. I thank the mom, but she is glaring at me. On the way home he hugs sleepy Dumbo the whole time. I remind him to be more careful with sleepy Dumbo in the future, and at home naptime commences peacefully.

About an hour ago my wife and I both got this text. I'm going to copy paste it:

{Me} and {my wife} I really don't appreciate the way {me} barged into my house earlier today while I was working. I know you both have a lot going on right now but the world doesn't revolve around you. {Her husband} and I agreed to do you a favor but that doesn't mean you get to just walk all over us. In the future if you call and we don't answer that means it isn't a good time to come over.

I felt very embarrassed and guilty after reading that. My wife, however, is furious. She called the wife of the other couple some indelicate names. I am really grateful to them for agreeing to babysit for us, and I accept that I am to blame for forgetting sleepy Dumbo the first time. I don't know if asking to come in and get him is quite as big a deal as she's making it out though, and my wife is pissed. I don't know how much of that is misplaced fear for her dad though. Am I an asshole, or was this just an unfortunate situation?",14266,10aeoi3,"YTA.

"AITA for having a ""scary"" kitty around children?","I (m27) have a  cat named stargazer. I adopted her around 3 years ago and she's truly a little survivor. She was abused and as a result has no eyes and only 3 three legs. Nobody wanted to adopt her because of hes deformaties and she's also a black cat so i did bc she was gonna be euthanized otherwise. 

My sister moved into my city this week and her and her husband (both 43) needed someone to watch the kids since they were gonna have a grown up celebrate party. I agreed. Both my nieces are 11 so they're not too little for me to handle and i'd also be great enrichment for my cat since she loves children and women (i'm the only man she trusts). My nieces loved her and while they first were a little scared they thought she was cute after a while. My sister went to pick them up and as the bell rang my cat went running also to the door and when my sister saw her she freaked out and started screaming. My cat ran away due to the noise and my sister started yelling at me that i let my cat around her kids and saying she's demonic.

AITA for sticking to my(29M) guns when it came to our Daughter's name,"When my wife(31F) and I(29M) were trying to get pregnant, we had a deal that if we have a boy, she would get to choose the full name and if we had a daughter I would. I was fine with this deal but we both had a veto in case we didn't like the name the other had chosen. Once we got pregnant, my wife was completely sure that we're having a boy because ""a mother knows."" Her entire family was convinced of it too. During baby shower, everything was blue and all the gifts were demanded to be masculine. Her mother had already started knitting things with the name my wife had chosen

Once the baby came, we saw it was a girl and I was ecstatic because, although I wanted both a boy and a girl, I always imagined my first born to be a girl. My wife, though seemingly exhausted, was happy too. When I wrote the name in the birth certificate, I let her know I was using the name I had already run past her.

Now, a year later, I come home from work and I find my MIL and wife there talking about my daughter, only they are using another name. When I inquired who they were talking about, they kinda went deer in headlights and blurted that they were talking about daughter. When I asked why they were using another name, my MIL said because that's what we decided to name her. Then she went on a rant about how it's unfair that I chose the name and how it's completely unsuitable for her, etc. I was shocked because this was the first time anyone had claimed any objections to the name.

So now I realize that the reason my daughter has trouble recognizing her name is because we have been using two different names the entire time. My wife later came to me suggesting we officially get her name changed and I stuck to my guns and told her we are not doing that and she needs to stop. This led to a fight about how unsupportive i am and stole her right to name the child she gave birth to. I told her that the opportunity to veto any name is long gone and she can't expect me to support something this stupid. Here's the worst part. I could be convinced to change the first name but the one she wants is a very odd feminine version of the name she wanted for her son. Imagine using a female version of the name Drake or Thomas. She got angry and left both my daughter and I and went to her parents. Her entire family except my FIL is calling me controlling and how it's unfair I chose the entire name and made it all about myself.

Honestly, this is so out of left field and creepy that I'm considering divorce. My parents and friends said they understand why I'm upset but should come to a compromise and change the name to something we both like and that divorce is overkill, but I don't think so. I feel it in my gut that she may be trying to recreate this son by sacrificing our daughter. If she can use a different name to address her for a year!!! What else has she been doing to her?

AITA for not telling my fiancé where I go on Sundays?,"So super weird situation and need a judgement. I (32M) have been engaged to Amanda (34F) for about a year, we dated for 3. She has a 12 year old daughter named Alexis. Me and Alexis have a good relationship. Me, Amanda and her ex all have a good relationship for the most part. I’m totally comfortable with my role. So Amanda, her ex and Alexis have this weird thing they do. They all get together on Sundays and hangout the three of them. I guess it started as a family tradition and then once they divorced they kept it going. They make breakfast, watch movies and just hang around all day together. I find it really weird tbh. Like I’m not insecure about it, but why you would want to spend a day a week with your ex is beyond me. I said how weird I found this when we started dating but Amanda said that Alexis looks forward to it weekly so she never stopped it. So at first I would just hang in our room or the basement all Sunday. But I got tired of being trapped in my own house so I started leaving the whole day. Amanda would never ask where I was going or anything. Wouldn’t even notice I was gone. 

So at first I was golfing or getting errands done. Or would find a bar. But then I reconnected with my old friend Bella. Bella and me dated 5 years ago and have remained good friends since. She just broke up with her husband and moved into a new apartment. I told her one Sunday that I was just planning on going to the movies and she instead invited me over. We smoked some weed, watched some movies, cooked and just hung out. It was nice and ever since it’s become my weekly tradition. Whenever Sunday would come I’d head over to Bella’s and we’d just hangout all day. 

I didn’t see the need to bring up to Amanda where I was going. She never asked or even wondered where I was every Sunday. So yesterday Bella stopped by our house to drop off my phone charger because I left it at her place. Amanda asked why Bella had my phone charger. And I told her that it’s where I was on Sunday. She asked why I was there and I told her that was my Sunday hangout spot. She flipped out. Saying how rude it was to not let her know I was hanging out with an ex. I laughed and said “do you really not see the irony with that statement”. She said it’s different because she was forthcoming about her/ex’s relationship and that if I had an issue with it then I should have said so. I said I did already bring it up and that she said it was important to her daughter. Was I supposed to interfere with the highlight of her daughters week in order to make myself feel better? No I’ll just sneak out the back door and head to my friends house. And that I didn’t see why this was even an issue at all. We trust each other and are adults. Amanda doesn’t want me over there anymore and said she wants me to find another way to spend my Sundays. I said then I don’t want your ex over here on Sundays anymore if that’s how we’re playing this. AITA?

Update: some shit has already hit the fan with the whole situation. I’ve put my foot down and said I’m not being forced out of my house anymore. That they can do Sunday funday at her ex’s place moving forward. I’ll post a complete update when I can. I did want to clarify that the reason I don’t hang out with them is that I was asked not to at first. Then I always felt awkward about the whole thing. So at first I stayed away because I was asked, then I felt like the fourth wheel so I decided to quit trying. Bella has really helped because she went through something similar with her SO.",14219,sexfa3,Girl wants you back. Who would bring a charger over if you forgot it. Get it next time.
